	<h3>the white house said high u.s. tariffs on japanese electronic goods would likely be imposed as scheduled on april 17, despite an all-out effort by japan to avoid them.     presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater made the remark one day before u.s. and japanese officials are to meet under the emergency provisions of a july 1986 semiconductor pact to discuss trade and the punitive tariffs.     fitzwater said: "i would say japan is applying the full-court press...they certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining their position." but he added that "all indications are they (the tariffs) will take effect."  reuter &#3;</h3>
