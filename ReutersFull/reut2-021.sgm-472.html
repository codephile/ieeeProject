	<h3>south korea's national news agency, yonhap, said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billion dlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for the country's cheap cars and electronic goods.     bank of korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own figures later in the week.     yonhap said the january-september surplus in the current account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled 7.03 billion dlrs.     this already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the whole of 1987 that the government set in june during talks with the international monetary fund aimed at averting a too rapid revaluation of the won against the dollar.     the agency said the september surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 468.1 mln in august and 899 mln a year earlier.     "exports in october could be relatively modest due to many public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten," yonhap said.     the sharp rise in the september surplus came from a resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous month.     more than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers, electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest between july and september.     the south korean government originally targeted a five billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export boom.     if confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the united states which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with seoul last year, government economists said.     the u.s. government, trying to stem protectionist pressure at home, has called on south korea to open more markets to american goods and revalue the won faster.     the won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on monday, representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
