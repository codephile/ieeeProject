	<h3>the commodity futures trading commission, cftc, should increase speculative position limits on agricultural futures and do away with them for financial futures, chicago board of trade, cbt, chairman karsten mahlmann said.     reporting to the cftc financial products advisory committee on the conclusions so far of an ad hoc cbt committee on off-exchange trading issues, mahlmann said, "we came to the conclusion that no meaningful purpose is served by speculative position limits."     position limits were supposed to prevent market manipulation, but "i would submit that the exchange and the cftc currently have all the tools necessary to prevent market manipulation, whether an account is speculative or a hedge," the cbt chairman said.     malmann said the issue was of particular concern to the cbt because the exchange faced increasing competition from foreign markets, most of which did not have position limits.     he said the ad hoc committee, which he also chairs, had agreed to propose that the definition of hedging be expanded to include risk management as well as risk reduction.     mahlmann said there was a danger that if a category of trading was given a name such as "non-speculative hedging," insurance companies and pension funds might be held back from engaging in it by the regulatory bodies that govern such entities.     the ad hoc committee proposed the establishment of "prudence guidelines" and a list of market activities that fell within those lines which might be lengthened in the future, he said.     the committee might also propose that cbt itself be allowed to enforce position limits on agricultural futures, he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
