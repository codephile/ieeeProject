	<h3>the african development bank (adb) said it increased its lending by 42.1 pct last year to 1.64 billion dlrs from 1.15 billion dlrs in 1985.     a bank statement said agriculture, set as the main growth area in a five-year economic recovery program adopted in 1985 by african states, received 607 mln dlrs, 37 pct of the total.     the adb is made up of the bank itself, its financing soft-loan arm, the african development fund (adf) and the nigeria trust fund, another soft-loan institution.     adb president babacar n'diaye released a 1987 economic report on africa prepared by the adb and the u.n. economic commission for africa (eca), saying progress was being made toward substantial increases in the bank's capital resources.     he said an ad-hoc committee of the adb board of governors, comprising 18 african and non-african countries, recommended a 200 pct increase in the organisation's capital for 1987-91.     he said such an increase would raise capital from around 6.55 billion dlrs to 19.66 billion dlrs, adding he was hopeful the proposal would be adopted at the annual meetings of the bank and fund, due to be held jointly in cairo in june.     he welcomed france's recent proposals to the paris club of western government creditors to extend repayment periods for third world debts and give better rescheduling terms.     "the proposition represents a major step forward. but african countries should not be the ones to ask for large-scale debt write-offs," he said. africa's total external debt was estimated at 175 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.     the eca-adb report said prospects would remain bleak for african economies in 1987 but predicted gross domestic product (gdp) growth ranging between 2.5 and four pct, compared with 1.2 pct last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
