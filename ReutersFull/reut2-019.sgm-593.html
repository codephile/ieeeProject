	<h3>two supertankers attacked in the gulf by iranian gunboats on saturday have anchored off bahrain for damage inspection, shipping sources said.     the 224,607 tonne norwegian ship mia margrethe and the liberian-registered stena concordia, 273,616 tonnes, both came under fire off the saudi arabian coastline.     agents for the tankers in bahrain told reuters the extent of damage had not yet been estimated.     both ships will be inspected in bahrain and may be repaired by the arab shipbuilding and repair yard co.     the u.s. frigate stark, damaged last month in an iraqi air attack in the gulf, left bahrain early on sunday and anchored four miles off shore. the vessel is due to return shortly to the u.s. for further repairs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
