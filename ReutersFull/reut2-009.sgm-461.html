	<h3>pacific gas and electric co said it will ask the federal energy regulatory commission to change federal regulations requiring the utility to buy electricity from unregulated private producers.     prices paid for this power under long term contracts signed before last year's fall in world oil prices now are more than twice as high as the actual value of the electricity, pacific gas said.     under the 1978 public utility regulatory policies act utilities are required to buy electricity from cogeneration facilities, which produce both steam and electricity.     since 1980, pacific gas has signed power purchase agreements, required by the law, with long-term price guarantees for more than 8,480 megawatts of capacity from private producers, the company said.     about 1,870 mw of that capacity is already on line, and accounted for about eight pct of the company's total energy sales in 1986, pacific gas said.     the company said it will ask ferc to amend the rules requiring purchase of this power so that the price paid for the electricity reflects current market values, and that utilities be required to buy only electricity needed in the near term.     contracts with cogeneration and other small power projects could cost pacific gas' consumers as much as 857 mln dlrs annually by 1990, the company said.     the 857 mln dlrs represents the difference between what pacific gas would pay for power from private producers and the cost to the company to produce the power on its own or buy it elsewhere, pacific gas said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
