	<h3>allied-signal inc's metglas products said it and <vacuumschmelze gmbh> signed a licensing agreement whereby each may practice the other's technology for amorphous metals in magnetic applications.     amorphous metal products are used in such devices as switch-mode power supplies and other electronic components. they are based on a proprietary rapid solidification process that gives metals a glasslike molecular structure, making them stronger, more ductile and corrosion-resistant, with unusual magnetic charateristics.  reuter &#3;</h3>
