	<h3>gencorp inc said it withdrew from consideration at its annual meeting on march 31 proposals aimed at providing for a stock split and an increased dividend so that it could focus its energies on responding to the takeover offer made last week by a partnership of afg industries inc <afg> and wagner and brown.     in addition to proposing an increase in the number of its outstanding common shares, gencorp had suggested the adoption of a classified or "staggered" board and the elimination of cumulative voting.     gencorp said these proposals could "distract energy and attention from the real task at hand -- to respond to the tender offer in a manner which is in the best interests of the company, its shareholders and its other constituencies."     gencorp said the proposal to increase its outstanding shares was made with the aim of declaring a stock split and a dividend increase.     the other proposals, it said, would provide for greater long-term stability and cohesiveness for the gencorp board.     the company did not indicate when it might resubmit the proposals for approval by its shareholders.  reuter &#3;</h3>
