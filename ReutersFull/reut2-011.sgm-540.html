	<h3>the outcome of negotiations on proposals by the european commission for a 330 ecus a tonne tax on ec-produced and imported oilseeds and marine oils remains difficult to predict, belgian agriculture minister paul de keersmaeker told a news conference.     de keersmaeker, who chaired a meeting of ec farm ministers which ended today, was asked about reports enough countries were against the tax to ensure that it would be defeated in negotiations on the ec farm price package for 1987/88.     he said it was true some countries were strongly opposed, but others were less so and others basically in favour.     "i think there is room for negotiations, and i would not want to make any predictions at this stage," de keersmaeker said.     yesterday, british minister michael jopling said britain, west germany, portugal, the netherlands and denmark were opposed to the measure. between them these countries have more than enough voting power to block it.     diplomatic sources said at today's meeting the spanish delegation also expressed strong reservations about the idea.  reuter &#3;</h3>
