	<h3>country movement of corn and soybeans increased modestly this morning, and basis bids were steady to higher, cash grain dealers said.     basis bids firmed in response to lower rates for barge freight, traders said, noting that the ohio river is swelling with snow runoff, discouraging barge loadings because of the high water levels.     moderate bookings continued in new crop soybeans, mostly for january 1988 delivery, with farmers pricing at least a portion of their crop at five dlrs a bushel or better when bids emerge at that level, they said.     movement in iowa was expected to slow considerably in the next few days, as farmers are beginning field work, they said.     dealers bid 104 and offered 106 pct for pik certificates.                   corn             soybeans  toledo         5 und may up 1   2 und may unc  cincinnati     1 ovr may up 2   3 ovr may up 2  new haven     12 und may unc    4 und may unc  n.e. indiana  11 und may unc    may price unc  chicago        4 und may unc    3 und may up 2  pekin          2 und may up 1   2 und may up 1  decatur        1 und may unc    2 ovr may unc  davenport      3 und may up 3   4 und may up 1  cedar rapids   9 und may up 1  14 und may up 1                   hrw wheat  toledo  58 lb 25 ovr may unc  chicago 57 lb 35 ovr may unc  cincinnati dp 10 ovr may unc  ne indiana dp 10 ovr may unc  pik certificates - 104 pct bid/106 pct ofrd unc  nc - no comparison  ua - unavailable  unc - unchanged dp - delayed pricing   reuter &#3;</h3>
