	<h3>lending by the world bank and its soft loan arm, the international development agency (ida), to china is expected to almost double to about two billion dlrs by 1989/90 from the levels of 1984 to 1986, foreign bankers told reuters.     they said approved lending in 1986/87 (july-june) is expected to total 1.4 billion dlrs, of which 550 mln will come from the ida and 850 mln from the world bank.     world bank figures show approved lending to china by the two bodies amounted to 1.137 billion in 1985/86, 1.102 billion in 1984/85 and 1.04 billion in 1983/84.     the bankers said that 1.2 billion dlrs had been disbursed by the end of 1986 and china's disbursement record compares very favourably with that of other countries.     they said japan has so far been the main source of bilateral concessional assistance for china, followed by west germany, canada, italy, australia and britain.     but china will probably find that such funds will not increase, except for those from japan and the world bank, given other claims, particularly from sub-saharan african countries which cannot raise commercial credits, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
