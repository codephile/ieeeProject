	<h3>canada has threatened to stop imports of danish pigmeat from july 14 after canadian veterinary inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a danish agriculture ministry official told reuters.     the canadians postponed the original july 1 deadline at the request of the european commission, which denmark approached for support.     danish foreign minister uffe ellemann-jensen said in an interview with the daily berlingske tidende: "denmark will not accept a ban on danish meat exports, and i am sure we can reach an understanding with the canadians with the help of the ec."     danish pigmeat exports to canada were worth 106 mln crowns in 1986, while canadian exports to the european community totalled about 6.5 billion u.s. dlrs.     some danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion that the canadian action was in response to tightening up by ec veterinary inspectors on canadian food exports to the ec.     but an official at the canadian embassy in copenhagen said the inspection of danish slaughterhouses was based on ec regulations. "canadian officials are very concerned about the trade implications. we are holding active discussions with the ec and bilaterally," she added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
