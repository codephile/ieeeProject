	<h3>finance minister kiichi miyazawa said major nations are taking action to stabilise exchange rates in line with their agreement in paris last month, government sources said.     miyazawa told an upper house session the six nations -- britain, canada, france, japan, the u.s. and west germany -- are abiding by the paris accord. the six agreed to cooperate to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels.     miyazawa said he wishes to attend a meeting of seven major nations (g-7) expected just before the imf/world bank interim committee meeting in washington starting on april 9.     the sources quoted miyazawa as saying japan is trying to prevent a further rise of the yen. japan is taking the matter seriously, he added.     asked if the six nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar at about 153 yen, the rate prevailing at the time of the paris talks, miyazawa declined to give specific figures and said any mention of specific rates would create an "unexpected situation."  reuter &#3;</h3>
