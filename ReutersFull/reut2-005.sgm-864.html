	<h3>sweden is recalculating the january inflation rate, which showed a sharp 1.3 pct rise in the cost of living, to check if the figures were overstated, a central bureau of statistics spokesman said.     rumours the figure had been overstated by 0.3 pct due to a statistical error sent bond prices soaring on the domestic credit market today.     the head of the bureau's consumer price index unit, hugo johannesson, told reuters, "we are extremely busy at the moment recalculating the january figures and i think the best thing is for us to be allowed to get on with it."  reuter &#3;</h3>
