	<h3>a group of investment firms led by far hills, n.j., investor natalie koether said it is seeking information about the shareholders of prime medical services inc, over which it has said it is seeking control.     in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, the group, which includes shamrock associates, included a march 6 letter to prime which asks for a complete list of all shareholders and their addresses.     the group said it wants the information so it can contact shareholders on issues, including election of an opposition slate of directors to the board and other proxy contests.     the koether group's letter gives the company five days to respond to its request. if there is no response from prime medical, the group said it would consider the demand refused and would take "other proper steps" to get the information.     the group said it already holds 1,483,886 prime medical shares, or 17.5 pct of the total. it said it has taken legal action to try to force the company to set an annual meeting and require all directors to stand for election.     in a previous sec filing, the group has said it has decided to try to seek control of prime medical through a tender offer, exchange offer, proxy contest or other ways.  reuter &#3;</h3>
