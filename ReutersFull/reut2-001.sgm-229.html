	<h3>the international monetary fund  said it approved 125.9 mln sdr's to assist development in jamaica.     of this total, 85 mln sdr's can be drawn over the next 15 months under a standby arrangement in support of the government's economic and financial program.     another 40.9 mln is available immediately under the compensatory financing facility, the imf's pool of funds to assist countries hit by export shortfalls. the imf said that jamaica had a shortfall in the year ended september 1986 due to reduced sales of bauxite, alummina and travel expenditures.     after some deterioration, the situation and prospects for jamaica improved substantially in 1986 and early 1987, mainly as a result of a decline in energy prices and interest rates, and a strong recovery in the tourist sector, the imf said.     the program that the new funding supports is designed to continue the adjustment and restructuring effort so as to achieve sustained growth, a lower rate of inflation and a balance of payments viability in the medium term.  reuter &#3;</h3>
