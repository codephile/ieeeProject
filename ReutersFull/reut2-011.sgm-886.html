	<h3>the restructured london stock exchange has proved itself an unqualified success in less than six months of operation, according to exchange chairman sir nicholas goodison.     more than 95 pct of the business has left the trading floor and is now conducted in the offices of member firms, goodison said in remarks prepared for delivery in new york.     "competitive bids and offers can now be seen on screens all over the country and business done is displayed on those same screens," he said, reaching more investors than before.     goodison said the new system has helped investors by promoting greater competition that in turn has led to reduced commissions and spread.     he said the exchange is now working on a small order automated execution system and a system to transfer securities without certificates.     new laws to be enacted in full later this year will help the securities and investments board investigate suspected abuses and punish wrongdoing, goodison said. he believes it is a misconception to say that the u.k. system of self-regulation is not as good as the u.s. system.     he noted that any violations of the rules are a criminal offense. "there is no fifth amendment plea to offer a u.k. inspector hot on the trial of an insider dealer," goodison said, in a reference to the u.s. legal system which allows individuals to remain silent on the grounds that they may incriminate themselves.     goodison said a major goal of the london exchange is to persuade multinational corporations to seek a listing in london. he said about 200 u.s. companies are now listed in london, enhancing their ability to raise capital.      reuter &#3;</h3>
