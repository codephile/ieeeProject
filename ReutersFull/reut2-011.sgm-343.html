	<h3>gruppo ferruzzi is studying a project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49 pct of its french unit european sugar (france) and could raise around 400 mln dlrs, ferruzzi chairman raul gardini said.     gardini told reuters the operation under consideration was aimed at "international markets" and that the figure of 400 mln dlrs given in some press reports "was probably about right."     european sugar, wholly-owned by ferruzzi unit eridania zuccherifici nazionali spa, is expected to absorb the european corn wet milling business of cpc international inc which ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.     ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to buy the cpc operation for 630 mln dlrs.     a ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was studying the transfer of the cpc business to european sugar along with a possible share offering in the paris unit, but gave no details.     the flotation plan has been interpreted by financial analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the cpc business.  reuter &#3;</h3>
