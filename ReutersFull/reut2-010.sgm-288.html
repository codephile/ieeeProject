	<h3>south korea plans to increase the size of its budget in 1988 by 11 to 12 pct from this year's 15,596 billion won, economic planning board officials said.     the proposed boost is based on a government forecast that gross national product (gnp) will grow by more than 7.5 pct and the gnp deflator by 3.5 pct in 1988, against targets of 8.0 pct and 3.5 pct respectively this year, they said.     details of the 1988 budget, in which spending will match revenue, have yet to be worked out, the officials said.     the balanced budget in 1986 totalled 13,800.5 billion won.  reuter &#3;</h3>
