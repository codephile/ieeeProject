	<h3>cpc international inc said it has completed previously-announced transactions involving its grocery products businesses in four asian countries with ajinomoto co inc <ajin.t>, raising about 300 mln dlrs.     it said it will receive about 40 mln dlrs more later, mostly this month, when closings are expected in three more countries.  proceeds will be used mostly for debt reduction.     cpc said ajinomoto has purchased its equity in knorr foods co ltd, a joint venture in japan between the two companies, with cpc to get fees for trademark and technology use.     cpc said ajinomoto is also purchasing 50 pct interests in cpc's wholly-owned subsidiaries in hong kong, malaysia, the philippines, singapore, taiwan and thailand.  reuter &#3;</h3>
