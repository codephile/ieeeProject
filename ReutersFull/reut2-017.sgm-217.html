	<h3>u.s. treasury secretary james baker has cancelled a trip to australia because of pressing business at home, including the visit this week by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone, a treasury spokesman said.     the spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said, "i would not draw any conclusion from the cancellation ... i would just say it's the press of business."     he said nakasone's visit was "part of the press of business" but denied the cancellation was linked to the current turmoil in the financial markets.  reuter                                     &#3;</h3>
