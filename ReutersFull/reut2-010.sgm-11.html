	<h3>joseph feshbach, chief market analyst at prudential-bache securities, said the stock market is poised to climb above dow jones industrial 2500 level by june.     the dow average is around 2380 today.     "liquidity is the biggest fundamental factor in the market and money coming out of fixed income funds and flowing into equities will propel the market sharply higher," feshbach said, noting that the market's peak will occur in june.     feshbach said that in early january he predicted that the dow jones industrial average, the most closely watched market barometer, would reach the 2400 level by april and the 2500 level by june. he said he is now even more optimistic, saying "the market is ready for a 150 point rise from current levels any day now."  reuter &#3;</h3>
