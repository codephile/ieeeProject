	<h3>a circuit court judge ordered the company that insured the solvency of international medical centres inc to show cause why it should not honour its contract with international, according to florida's department of insurance, which had filed a petition on the matter.     as previously reported, international, the largest health maintenance organization in florida, was declared insolvent on may 14. federal regulators had also told the company its medicare contract would be terminated on july 31 because of the company's financial and management problems.     michelle mclawhorn, florida insurance department spokeswoman, said international's insurer, state mutual life assurance co of america, had made clear it would fight activation of the policy because international did not provide it with accurate financial records.     state mutual could not be reached for comment.     mclawhorn said it was not yet known how many creditors international had or how big its debt was. the court gave state mutual 20 days to show why it should not be obliged to pay claims against the solvency policy.  reuter &#3;</h3>
