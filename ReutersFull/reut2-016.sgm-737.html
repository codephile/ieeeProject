	<h3>advanced genetic sciences inc said it  received final authorization for field testing of its genetically altered bacteria, frostban, developed to protect fruit and nut crops from frost damage.     the company said its state permit by the california department of food and agriculture is the final clearance needed, ending three and one-half years of laboratory and greenhouse testing and various government approvals.     a public interest group concerned about the environmental safety of the test tried repeatedly to block government approval of the testing.     "its's gratifying when government relies on scientific expertise in reaching its decision and rejects the rhetoric that has delayed this risk-free field trial for too long," said advanced genetic sciences president and chief executive officer joseph bouckaert.     the company said it expects to begin the testing, on strawberry plants covering one-fifth of an acre, later this spring.     the test site is near brentwood, california.  reuter &#3;</h3>
