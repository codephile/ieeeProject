	<h3><phoenix canada oil co ltd> said it intends to appeal a ruling in u.s. federal district court of delaware on its suit against texaco inc <tx>, chevron corp <chv>, chevron's gulf oil unit and their ecuador subsidiaries.     the court ruled against phoenix's claim that a royalty it held should have entitled it to a share of the 160 mln u.s. dlrs paid to the defendants when they sold 62.5 pct of their working interest in ecuador oil operations, phoenix said.     however, the court did award phoenix 1,250,000 canadian dlrs in underpayments, the company said.     phoenix canada oil said the fiduciary relationship that existed between phoenix, as the royalty owner, and the defendants, as the working interest operators, was fundamental in the oil industry and was not reflected in the court's ruling.  reuter &#3;</h3>
