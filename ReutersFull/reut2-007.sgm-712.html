"it could be the end of this year or the beginning of next year that the linkage could become operational," mahlmann told the futures industry association.     the two exchanges signed a memorandum of understanding on february 9 calling for the eventual establishment of a mutual offset clearing system that would allow traders to initiate positions on one exchange and liquidate them on the other.     mahlmann said the contracts involved in the link could include british gilts, eurobonds, japanese government bonds, foreign currencies and the financial times-stock exchange 100 stock index.  reuter &#3;</h3>
