	<h3>the federal trade commission said it eased a requirement that allied-signal inc's allied corp subsidiary get prior ftc approval before making certain acquisitions in the high-purity acid market.     the ftc said it ended the prior approval requirement because allied no longer has businesses covered by the order. other restrictions still apply, it said.     the restrcitions stem from a 1983 order by the ftc settling charges that allied's 1981 acquisition of fisher scientific co reduced competition in three high-purity acid markets.  reuter &#3;</h3>
