	<h3>the japanese government is considering buying u.s.-made supercomputers to help defuse mounting trade friction between the two countries, trade minister hajime tamura was quoting as saying.     japanese officials said tamura told visiting u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter that the government may set aside money for the purchase of the supercomputers in a supplementary budget to be drawn up later this year.     but he emphasised that the matter was still under study and that no firm decision had been made.     tamura urged yeutter to lift the trade sanctions imposed against japan and argued that the yen's rapid rise was already working to correct the country's trade imbalance.     but, according to japanese officials, yeutter held out little hope that the american trade sanctions would be lifted soon and said the united states needed action from japan to boost its domestic demand and imports, not just words.     in order to lift the tariffs imposed on 300 mln dlrs worth of japanese exports last friday, the u.s. needs proof that its joint computer chip pact with japan is working. and that will take time, yeutter was quoted as telling tamura.  reuter &#3;</h3>
