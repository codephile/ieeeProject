	<h3>japanese scientists say they have developed a material which can help detect the killer disease aquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids).     leading japanese aids scientist professor naoki yamamoto told reuters he and other scientists working at yamaguchi university in southern japan have been testing the material's ability to filter the aids virus from blood since last april and produced successful results.     he said the material, a tube made from a cellulose membrane, could only be used to diagnose aids sufferers and not cure them.     the share price of asahi chemical company<asat.t>, which plans to market the product in about a year's time, rose sharply but ended the day only 27 yen higher at 905 yen a share.     the cellulose tubes, which asahi will market under the name bemberg microporous membrane (bmm), can also separate the virus of the kidney ailment hepatitis and may be applied to diagnosing polio sufferers, vice-president of asahi chemical, r. yumikura said. ashai will supply bmm for research purposes soon.     shares of companies even remotely related to the fight against aids have risen on the tokyo stock market since the first japanese woman died of the disease in kobe in january.  reuter &#3;</h3>
