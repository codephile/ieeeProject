	<h3>central bank governor chang chi-cheng rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the taiwan dollar against the u.s. dollar to stop them losing orders to south korea, hong kong and singapore, a spokesman for the taiwan textile federation said.     he quoted chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last saturday the government could not fix the taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one u.s. dollar due to u.s. pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.     the federation asked the government on february 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level.  reuter &#3;</h3>
