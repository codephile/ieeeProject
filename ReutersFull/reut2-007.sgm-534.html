	<h3>president reagan accused the soviet union of exceeding a traditional restrictive reading of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, but said the u.s. saw no reason yet to follow suit.     "we believe that the soviet union has been going even beyond a liberal interpretation of the treaty," he said at a news conference.     there has been speculation the u.s. administration was moving toward a looser reading of the treaty in order to permit the development of the "star wars" anti-missile system, but reagan said no decision has yet been made.  reuter &#3;</h3>
