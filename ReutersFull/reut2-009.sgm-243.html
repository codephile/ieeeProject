	<h3>london's rise as a trading centre for u.s. government debt has been spurred by the increasing use of interest rate swaps, which are now arranged for most new issues in the eurobond markets, traders and analysts said.     indeed, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new debt issued here last year -- over 186 billion dlrs worth -- was part of either an interest rate or currency swap.     "the u.s. treasuries market here is swap-driven," said david jones, vice president at goldman sachs and co international and head of its u.s. government bond trading desk.     "it is commonplace to have trades of 100 mln dlrs or more in 10-years, seven years or five years, all related to an interest rate swap or hedging of a eurobond deal," jones said at a recent conference on the u.s. treasuries market.     just a year or so ago, he said, trades of that size going through brokers screens in london were unthinkable.     traders said that over the past two weeks, while trading in u.s. treasuries has been almost frozen by indecision over the direction of interest rates, swap-related deals have provided the sole source of new business.     dealers said that last week, a 260 mln dlr trade involving two and 10-year treasuries was transacted on brokers' screens.     the trade, they said, was swap related.     there are no firm figures on exactly how much u.s. treasury debt is traded here and estimates vary widely.     but wrightson economics, a u.s.-based research firm which drew its data from u.s. treasury reports, estimated that gross transactions in u.s. government securities in london rose to 341 billion dlrs in the first nine months of 1986 alone, against 188 billion in all of 1985.     wrightson estimates that about 20 pct of all u.s. treasury trading is transacted outside the u.s., with tokyo forming the third major centre.     and while figures are not yet available for the last quarter, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend continued, traders say.     richard lacy, chief executive at exco international, put average daily treasuries trading volume in london at about 15 billion dlrs. exco recently purchased an 80 pct interest in rmj securities inc, one of the four major brokers in u.s. government bonds which has offices in london, new york and tokyo.     but dick van splinter, president of rmj's competitor, fundamental brokers inc's london operations, estimates average daily turnover is no more than four to five billion dlrs.     but even at the low range of estimates, treasuries trading volume is at least equal to that in the u.k.'s own government bonds, known as gilts.      jeremy ford, vice president at bankers trust international ltd, explained that u.s. treasuries are used by intermediaries in swap transactions to lock in the "spread," the difference between the interest rate the borrower has to pay and the rate that the counterparty is obliged to pay.     but even beyond swap-related activity, dealers said the nature of trading in london has changed.     "the interesting thing our figures show is the transition in london from a marketing effort to a trading effort," said louis crandall, an economist at wrightson who has been collecting the data.     crandall said that previously, firms' activities were limited to trying to sell u.s. securities to european investors. now, however, they appear increasingly willing act as principal in transactions rather than acting on behalf of their new york offices.     increasingly, traders say, firms maintain separate profit and loss sheets for their london operations so that trading decisions can be made independently from the u.s. headquarters.     many of the major u.s. firms, including merrill lynch and co, shearson lehman brothers inc and chemical bank trade for their own accounts here.     also, traders point out, the number of u.s. firms operating in london has increased sharply over the past year, as has the number of european and asian banks which trade u.s. government securities.     within the past few months, national westminster bank plc's county bank subsidiary and swiss bank corp have applied to the federal reserve bank of new york to become primary dealers in u.s. government securities and their london offices have just recently received direct-dealing brokers screens.     and donaldson lufkin jenrette, already a primary dealer, is preparing to open a u.s. treasuries trading desk in london.     dick van splinter, president of fundamental brokers inc, the largest of the four major government bond brokers here, said he now has 45 firms using direct-dealing screens, up from 35 a year ago.  reuter &#3;</h3>
