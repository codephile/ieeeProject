	<h3>australian police said they charged a former currency clerk of westpac banking corp <wstp.s> with misappropriating 8,300 dlrs in july in an alleged foreign-exchange fraud.     a spokeswoman for the new south wales corporate affairs commission (cac) said the arrest was part of its investigation stemming from complaints from westpac and <kleinwort benson australia ltd>.     cac and westpac officials said they were working out how much money was involved, but said press reports it was as much as five mln dlrs were probably exaggerated.     police told reporters it was alleged the former clerk quoted an incorrect dealing price relationship between the yen and the swiss franc.     they said the cac was investigating 14 other cases involving 214,000 dlrs.     a kleinwort benson spokesman declined to comment on the case but the company said in a statement yesterday a small loss incurred in 1986 in its foreign-exchange division was unrelated to "certain alleged forex irregularities."  reuter &#3;</h3>
