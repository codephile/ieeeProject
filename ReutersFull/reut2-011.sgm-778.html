	<h3>prime minister bob hawke has decided against an early election despite a leadership crisis in the opposition coalition, australian government officials said.     they said hawke made the decision after meeting senior advisers and high-ranking members of the ruling labour party in canberra last night.     an expected improvement in the economy predicted by an organisation for economic cooperation and development report was a major factor in hawke's deciding against calling an election now, they said.     the officials picked march 5 next year as the most likely election date, which would allow the government to complete its full five-year term of office and ensure that hawke becomes the longest-serving labour prime minister in australian history.     hawke, however, has not withdrawn his earlier threat to consider dissolving both houses of parliament if the opposition national-liberal party coalition blocked legislation to introduce identity cards for australians.  reuter &#3;</h3>
