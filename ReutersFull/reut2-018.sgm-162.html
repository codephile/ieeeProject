	<h3>finance minister edouard balladur is undecided over his future in office after next spring's presidential election, his spokesman said.     "he (balladur) has taken no definitive decision about his activities in a year's time," his spokesman said in answer to a reuters question.     he was responding to questions on a comment made by balladur, a close political associate of right wing prime minister jacques chirac, in a radio interview.     balladur told a radio monte carlo interviewer "from next year i shall rediscover the freedom of private life."     france is due to hold a presidential election in april or may next year. under the french political system, the prime minister and his cabinet tender their resignation to the incoming president, giving him freedom to appoint a new government.     chirac, leader of a two-party coalition government is widely assumed to be a presidential candidate, while incumbent socialist president francois mitterrand is tipped by most opinion polls to win if he decides to stand again.     balladur's stringent economic policies have come under increasing criticism inside and outside the coalition parties in recent months as official statistics and forecasts have shown slowing growth prospects and rising inflation.     but the spokesman said balladur was having no second thoughts about the direction of his policies. "the minister of state (balladur) has one current ambition, which is to achieve his mission of national economic recovery," he said.     "he refuses to prejudge the future a year from now."  reuter &#3;</h3>
