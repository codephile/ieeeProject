	<h3><noranda inc> said it began salvage operations at its murdochville, quebec, mine, where a fire last week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.      another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as 24 hours before they were brought to safety.     noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is still unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor belt.      noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp leading into the zone where the fire was located. the company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine.      noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone will not be completed before the end of april.     noranda said the quebec health and safety commission, the quebec provincial police and noranda itself are each conducting an investigation into the fire.     production at the mine has been suspended until the investigations are complete. the copper mine and smelter produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680 people.      the smelter continues to operate with available concentrate from stockpiled supplies, noranda said. reuter  reuter &#3;</h3>
