	<h3>lme morning ring dealings in copper ended with three months grade a business at 883 stg per tonne, up seven stg from yesterday's afternoon kerb close, equivalent to 1,417 dlrs per tonne, a rise of 11 dlrs.     morning ring dealings featured a wave of cash pricing purchases near the official close which established an indicated spread backwardation of 37 stg after earlier borrowing at a premium of 32 stg, unchanged from yesterday afternoon, traders said.     forward values extended pre-market gains, despite currency factors, with short covering and some chart support evident.     ring dealings also included options-linked borrowing interest from end april dates for one month at a backwardation of 23 stg.     analysts said the 870 stg area appears to have provided a minor chart support base, although upside potential remains limited against a background of routine physical demand and a buoyant u.k. currency.     on the pre-market, activity was mainly dollar-based and within the range 1,408 to 1,411 dlrs per tonne, traders said.     standard grade retained a spread backwardation of 10 stg but was tradeless.  reuter &#3;</h3>
