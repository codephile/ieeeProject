	<h3>an iranian military commander said iraqi troops suffered 3,000 casualties in a week-old offensive by iran's forces in the mountains of northeast iraq.     the iranian news agency irna quoted the commander in the kurdish border village of haj omran as saying nine iraqi counter-attacks had been repulsed with heavy casualties.     he said iraq lost at least 3,000 men killed or wounded and another 289 captured, irna, monitored by the british broadcasting corp, said.     iran's offensive into iraqi kurdistan is coupled with support for anti-iraqi kurdish rebel operations in the region.  reuter &#3;</h3>
