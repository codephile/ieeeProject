	<h3>one of the top executives of the international monetary fund (imf) has tendered his resignation charging that the united states has been pressuring the agency to reduce the conditions it places on some loans, monetary sources said.     c. david finch, an australian who heads the imf's exchange and trade relations department, told the imf executive board on wednesday that he planned to leave by the end of next month after 37 years with the agency.     the sources said that finch, in a statement considered unprecedented, told the board that the united states had brought undue pressure on the imf to approve funding for zaire and egypt.     "to resign in this manner is highly unusual, perhaps unprecedented," a monetary source said.     neither finch nor u.s. imf representative charles dallara could be reached for comment.     the imf, since the emergence of the debt crisis in 1982, has pressed many countries to tighten their belts and cut back on social spending as conditions to granting assistance.     the united states recently has been taking the position that countries that take needed economic reform measures relying more on market forces and private enterprise should be encouraged by assistance from the imf and development banks.     zaire, under the government of president mobutu sese seko has recently been taking many reform measures designed to heal its ailing economy.     the imf last year approved a 22-month loan package for zaire totaling 270 mln dlrs.     the united states has been considering the possibility of seeking access to a military base in zaire but no decision has been reached.     egypt, for its part, has been holding talks with the imf aimed at reaching a final accord on a new one billion dlr loan package with the united states pressing for a quick deal, according to the sources.     however, they said a tentative plan for egypt that is currently being reviewed by the management of the fund prior to going to the executive board for full approval has raised a number of questions about the country's ability to repay.     egypt is also a linchpin in the broad framework of u.s. middle east policy.     the department headed by finch, among other responsibilties, makes certain that imf policies and loan conditions are wielded evenly among countries.     monetary sources have said that the united states had brought pressure on the imf to approve a loan package for mexico using economic conditions that have not been broadly used before, but finch, according to the sources, made no reference to this.     under the debt initiative announced 18 months ago by treasury secretary james baker, the united states made the decision that debtor countries should be encourged to grow out of their difficulties rather than rely on austerity measures.      he also recommended that commercial banks provide 20 billion dlrs in new loans for the debtor countries while the mutilateral banks add some six billion dlrs over three years.     a key part of the proposal gave the world bank a much greater role in dealing with the debt crisis, in part because of its familiarity with developing countries and their problems.     the initiative, while widely heralded as a good first step toward improving the the growing debt crisis, was viewed by some at the imf as a rebuke of previous austerity measures insisted upon by the fund in return for loans.    reuter &#3;</h3>
