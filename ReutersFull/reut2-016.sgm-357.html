	<h3>despite a sharp early fall in texaco inc bonds, the 125 billion dlr u.s. junk bond market was largely unaffected by texaco's weekend filing for protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, analysts said.     "texaco's filing had little, if any, effect on junk bond prices this morning. it should not spill over to the overall market like ltv corp's <ltv> bankruptcy filing did last summer," said one analyst.     traders said some texaco debt issues fell over 30 points this morning in thin trading, but recouped about half that.     "because of the texaco filing, some investors bid down its paper to the mid-60 area (around 650 dlrs per 1,000 dlr face value) from around 95 friday," said a dealer in high-yield, low rated bonds.     "but sellers could not be found at those levels and the bids soon rebounded to the 75 to 85 area," he added, referring to such issues as texaco's 13 pct notes of 1991, the 13-1/4s of 1999 and 13-5/8s of 1994. all were in the mid-90s friday.     the rebound occurred after standard and poor's corp downgraded the debt ratings of 8.4 billion dlrs of debt of texaco and its subsidiaries to d, traders noted.     s and p cited the weekend bankruptcy filing. the agency said it uses the d grade for securities issued by companies in chapter 11 reorganization.     moody's investors service inc followed suit, cutting most of the debt of texaco and its units to caa.     the junk bond market experienced a short-lived downturn last summer when ltv's bankruptcy filing sparked worries that credit conditions of other steel companies would also worsen.     "this is clearly not the case with texaco," said one trader. because of their high yields, junk bonds have lately outperformed investment grade corporates, he and others said.     analysts and portfolio managers said they viewed texaco's bankruptcy filing as a defensive move.     indeed, a texas state court of appeal this morning said the bankruptcy petition effectively stays texaco's obligation under texas law to post a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr litigation against pennzoil co <pzl>.     "the filing was not the result of credit weakness. the company got through the oil crisis alright," said one portfolio manager.     others who run junk bond portfolios agreed with that assessment and said they would still buy high-yield issues.  reuter &#3;</h3>
