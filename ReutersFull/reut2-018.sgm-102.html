	<h3>the british broadcasting corporation declined comment on rumours circulating in the london stock exchange that it would release an opinion poll tonight showing the conservative and labour parties running level in marginal seats. the general election is set for june 11.     the rumour was cited by several market dealers as a factor contributing to this afternoon's slide in share prices. the ftse 100 share index in late afternoon was down 7.4 points at 2,220.7, having earlier touched a new record of 2,248.8.     nationally, most polls put the conservatives nine to 10 points ahead, enough for a comfortable election victory  reuter &#3;</h3>
