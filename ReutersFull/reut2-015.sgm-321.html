	<h3>the senate unanimously approved legislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural gas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burning plants.     the bill, sponsored by senate energy committee chairman bennett johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to pay higher than market prices.     "this legislation will open up new natural gas markets," the lousiana democrat said.     the gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.     "now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed," johnston said.     in a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new baseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate modifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate fuel.  reuter &#3;</h3>
