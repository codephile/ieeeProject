	<h3><toronto dominion bank> said it agreed to acquire a seat on the toronto stock exchange, becoming the first canadian bank to do so after government proposals to allow banks full involvement in the securities industry.     the bank, canada's fifth largest, said one of its subsidiaries was already a member of the toronto futures exchange and that this further step showed the bank's commitment to active involvement in the securities industry.     toronto dominion established a discount brokerage service in 1984 called green line investors service that now serves more investors than any other discount broker in canada.     the bank previously said in january that it preferred to establish its own securities unit rather than acquire an existing investment dealer.     "full tse access will enable us to provide an even higher level of customer service and maintain green line's position as an industry leader," said toronto dominion president robert korthals in a statement.     he told reporters at a news conference that the bank agreed to purchase the seat for 195,000 dlrs from hector m. chisholm and co.     the price represents a recent high from the 166,000 dlrs paid for a seat in 1981, but the record price remains 200,000 dlrs paid in 1929.  reuter &#3;</h3>
