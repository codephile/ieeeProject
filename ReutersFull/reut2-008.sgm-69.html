	<h3>bundesbank vice-president helmut schlesinger said that although west german economic growth was not expected to be satisfactory in the first 1987 quarter, two pct growth was still attainable for the whole of the year.     a further rise in the value of the mark would worsen export prospects and have a negative effect on investments, he told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview. but if such an appreciation did not materialize, the economy would expand.     the federal government has predicted a growth rate of 2-1/2 pct or more in its annual economic report published in january, but some economists have said the forecast was too optimistic.     schlesinger said private consumption was likely to rise strongly. government expenditure and construction were also expected to increase. but there was uncertainty about the prospects for exports and investment.     the bundesbank had viewed with concern the money supply overshoot in 1986, but the sharp rise was unlikely to have an effect on inflation in the forseeable future. however, there were potential dangers in the long run.     schlesinger said there was hope that in 1987 the west german money supply would grow within the three to six pct target zone set in december.     schlesinger said the dampening effect on inflation of the drop in import prices could continue to a lesser degree for some time. prices in west germany were likely to rise between one and two pct this year.     he said 1987 would be the fifth successive growth year for the west german economy. although there was a possibility of a downturn at some stage in the future, there were no signs this would happen in 1988.     the main risks for the west german economy stemmed from its close ties with the rest of the world, schlesinger added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
