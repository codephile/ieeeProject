	<h3>the <sanwa bank ltd's> three-year business plan foresees securities and international operations making a greater contribution to operating profits, a bank official said.     the bank's plan also emphasises retail and medium and small-sized business operations, he told reuters.     officials at <fuji bank ltd> and <mitsubishi bank ltd> outlined similar three-year plans.     they said lower interest rates and financial liberalisation have cut profits from dealings with big firms to nearly nothing.     "they don't need us, they can do their own financing," one official said.     sanwa bank's plan forecasts that securities and international operations will contribute 40 pct of total operating profits by the end of the fiscal year ending march, 1990, compared with 30 pct in fiscal 1985, the sanwa official said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
