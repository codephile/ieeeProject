	<h3>italian industrial production fell 3.4 pct in january, compared with the same month last year, the national statistics institute istat said.     the rise follows a year-on-year increase in december 1986 of 4.5 pct.     istat's industrial production index, base 1980, not seasonally adjusted, registered 93.3, compared with 96.6 in january 1986.     istat said there were 20 working days in january, the same as december, but one fewer than january last year.     istat said the year-on-year fall reflected poorer performances in the footwear, clothing, textiles, chemicals and metals industries.     it said office machinery and data sectors, wood and furniture, precision mechanics, oil and electricity showed improved activity.     calculations based on istat figures showed industrial production rose 2.4 pct in january, on a month-on-month basis, after falling 12.0 pct in december over november.  reuter &#3;</h3>
