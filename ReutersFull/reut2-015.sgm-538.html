	<h3>the bundesbank sees no current reason to change monetary course, vice-president helmut schlesinger told reuters in a telephone interview.     schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by bundesbank board member claus koehler and west berlin state central bank president dieter hiss, which, dealers said, revived some speculation that german interest rate cuts may once again be under discussion.     schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his two central bank council colleagues.     but he added that the last central bank council meeting on april 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of "subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news brought by several state central bank presidents.     "much is going better than the impression gained by the public from the january figures, which have been in the meantime superseded," he said.     german january industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a decline of 0.9 pct in december. new industry orders fell 1.9 pct after they had been unchanged in december.     bank economists said that the two together showed the economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter of 1987.     aside from the economic developments, schlesinger added, a steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark rate around current levels as bundesbank president karl otto poehl had said while attending the washington world bank/imf meeting.     asked, however, if the bundesbank could move to cut rates on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase tender, due next tuesday, schlesinger said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."     responding to the question whether the bundesbank had moved away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of targetting currency rates, schlesinger said he could have no comment on the subject while negotiations were still in progress in washington.  reuter &#3;</h3>
