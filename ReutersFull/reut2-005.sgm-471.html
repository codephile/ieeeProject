	<h3>belgian prime minister wilfried martens announced to parliament a plan to reduce the 1987 government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.     he said this will enable the requirement to be held to 419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of 417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.     martens said following a lowering of government estimates of 1987 nominal gnp growth and a re-estimation by government departments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that unless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the target by 22.5 billion francs.     martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts by 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion. the remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through treasury operations.     martens said the money is being found through a series of small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of two billion francs through the sale of part of the government's 50 pct holding in the gas company distrigaz.     last year, the government announced a major program designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.     the program was designed to get belgium out of what the government said was a "snowball effect" under which the government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying existing debt.     in 1986, the government financing requirement is estimated at 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of gnp.  reuter &#3;</h3>
