	<h3>current prospects for this year's grain crop in bulgaria and romania appear less favorable than in 1986, the u.s. agriculture department's officer in belgrade said in a field report.     the report said the assessment was based on travel in the two countries from march 30 to april 4.     it said crop conditions were better than earlier expected following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the prolonged winter temperatures this spring.     however, in general plant development was at least three weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied greatly by regions, the report said.     fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about 65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others varied considerably, the report said.     fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and uneven stands. spotty germination and winterkill in those fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
