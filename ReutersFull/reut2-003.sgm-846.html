	<h3>u.s. senate republican leader robert dole said congress should consider legislation to apply the so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities.     dole told the national corn growers association that he thought the proposal, supported by the reagan administration, "should be seriously considered" because a refusal to do so could "play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls" placed on production.     however, dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92 option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted.     the senate republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two problems. first, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. in addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill, dole said.     dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the soviet union could help improve u.s. relations with that country.     dole said that the united states has made the decision to trade with moscow and that it's important to offer competitive prices.     the senator predicted congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsidize.     dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.     the reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes "are not going anywhere" this year, dole said, singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.     asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the state department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the soviet union, dole said he didn't see any change.     dole also said it would be a very close call in the senate whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.     dole said he was encouraged by the selection of republican david karnes to replace the late sen. edward zorinsky (d-neb.)  reuter &#3;</h3>
