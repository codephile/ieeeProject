	<h3>general motors corp said in a corporate statement its executives can think of "no person better qualified" than alan greenspan to replace paul volcker as chairman of the federal reserve board.     "greenspan possesses great understanding of both the american and international economies and the interaction between them," the company said in a statement. "he also possesses enormous good judgement."     no other possible replacement for paul volcker would be more likely to have as steadying an influence on and be as well received by financial markets here and overseas as alan greenspan, it said.     gm also said the u.s. owes volcker "a great debt of gratitiude" by wringing inflation out of the u.s. economy."  reuter &#3;</h3>
