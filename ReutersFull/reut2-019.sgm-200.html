	<h3>the federal reserve is likely to add temporary reserves to the banking system this morning by executing system repurchase agreements, economists said.     the fed faces a need to add a large volume of reserves this statement period to offset a drain caused by rising treasury balances at the fed after the june 15 tax date.     most economists are predicting over-the-weekend system repurchases. but some, who see a smaller adding requirement, are forecasting a less aggressive combination of three- and six-day repos. fed funds were trading at 6-3/4 pct, close to yesterday's 6.81 pct average.  reuter &#3;</h3>
