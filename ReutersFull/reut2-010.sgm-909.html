	<h3>turkish prime minister turgut ozal said turkey and greece were moving towards talks in their row over oil rights in the aegean sea.     he was speaking to reporters after talks with turkish ambassador to athens nazmi akiman, who arrived last night from a meeting with greek premier andreas papandreou.     "both sides are now moving towards starting discussions. in order not to jeopardise these, it would be improper to give details," he said.     ozal told reporters akiman came to turkey to brief the government "on efforts aimed at starting discussions between turkey and greece" and a reply would be made to athens soon.     he did not say whether he was taking up papandreou's renewed offer today that the two countries meet to discuss how to refer the issue to the international court of justice at the hague, but said the court was not the only way to a solution.     turkey has in the past rejected the basis for greece's proposal to go to the court, a 1956 geneva convention and the law of the sea, which it says support athens' arguments.  reuter &#3;</h3>
