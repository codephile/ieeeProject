	<h3>the canadian bond rating service said it downgraded ratings for long-term senior debt and subordinated debentures at <royal bank of canada> and <bank of montreal> due partly to loan loss problems.     royal's long-term senior debt was downgraded to a plus (high) from a plus plus and 1.60 billion dlrs of subordinated debentures to a plus from a plus plus (low). bank of montreal's senior long-term debt rating fell to a plus (high) from a plus plus (low) and 1.46 billion dlrs of subordinated debentures to a plus (low) from a plus.     the rating service cited continued difficulties among royal bank customers, particularly in the energy industry, a continued high level of loan losses expected this year and  relatively high sovereign debt exposure in relation to common equity.     it cited bank of montreal's below average profitability and internal capital generation and relatively high international debt exposure in relation to common equity, although it noted that loan losses were expected to moderate in 1987.  reuter &#3;</h3>
