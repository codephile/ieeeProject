	<h3>securities and commodity exchanges should consider establishing a mechanism for halting trading of equities, futures and options when there is unusual price volatility, a top securities and exchange, sec, official said.     richard ketchum, director of the sec's division of market regulation, said a "short, system-wide halt" of trading of stocks, futures contracts and options on futures contracts would "let everyone get a breath" in especially volatile markets.     ketchum made his remarks in connection with a futures industry association panel discussion on stock index futures and stock market volatility.     the sec official did not attempt to define "volatile" markets.     commodity futures trading commission chairman susan phillips later told reporters that exchanges already have the authority to halt trading if an emergency is declared.     but she said ketchum's proposal was "something to look at" and that she expected the exchanges to explore procedures for making order imbalances public.     william brodsky, president of the chicago mercantile exchange, cme, told reuters that considering ketchum's proposal would be a "worthwhile exercise," but that implementation of a trading halt mechanism posed "major, philosophical, economic questions."     ketchum said price limits on contracts "are not particularly useful in dealing with volatility."     earlier, brodsky announced the cme board of directors had decided last tuesday to drop a plan to set a 12-point limit on the daily price movement of its standard & poor's 500 contract.  reuter &#3;</h3>
