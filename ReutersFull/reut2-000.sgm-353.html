"we have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially," he said.     the united states, taiwan's main trading partner, has said the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. it has criticised the cuts as too selective.      taiwan's trade surplus with the united states hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. the surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which wang said made taiwan a target for u.s. protectionism.     wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened taiwan's position in talks with washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners.     a special taiwanese trade delegation leaves for washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of taiwan textiles.     under the accord, taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. taipei has said it is losing markets to south korea and hong kong which were given more generous terms.  reuter... &#3;</h3>
