	<h3>the osaka stock exchange has postponed its planned april 6 launch of a futures contract tied to stock market movements until after parliament considers a bill to cut tax on futures transactions, an exchange official said.     opposition parties have disrupted all parliamentary proceedings to protest government plans for a new sales tax.     the bill would reduce the tax to 0.0125 pct of the transaction value from the current 0.2 pct, the exchange said.     the osaka futures contract will be for a package of 50 issues selected from the 225 stocks that make up the nikkei average on the tokyo stock exchange.  reuter &#3;</h3>
