	<h3>haiti's agriculture minister yesterday announced his department will permit the importation of 730 black creole pigs, which had been banned from the island nation since 1983.     between 1981 and 1983, a team of canadian veterinarians funded by the united states, canada, mexico and costa rica supervised the slaughter of all haiti's 1,200,000 pigs under a program to eradicate african swine flu.     today's announcement that catholic relief services (caritas) can import 730 jamaican pigs comes after months of protests by farmers who had owned 90 pct of the slaughtered pigs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
