	<h3>a meeting of leading politicians, bankers and economists has forecast austrian real gross domestic product growth for this year at between 0.5 and 1.5 pct, a government spokesman said.     this compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the semi-official institute for economic research (wifo) last december.     helmut kramer, spokesman for chancellor franz vranitzky, told reuters that the forecast had been made during the meeting attended by vranitzky, finance minister ferdinand lacina, national bank president stefan koren and a wifo representative.     economists have been cutting growth forecasts recently mainly due to expectations of a poor export performance this year, notably to eastern europe and oil exporting states.     hannes androsch, general director of creditanstalt-bankverein <cabv.vi>, today put 1987 gdp growth at between one and 1.5 pct.     kramer also said the meeting had heard that unemployment for the year would be above the 5.5 pct forecast, but was unlikely to be more than six pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
