	<h3>rolls royce, the u.k.'s state-owned car and aircraft engine maker, is seeking a 250 mln stg multiple option facility to provide it with additional sources of financing, banking sources said.     they said the facility, which will be syndicated among a small group of the borrower's relationship banks, is being put in place ahead of the privatisation of rolls royce in april or may. at the borrower's request, terms will not be disclosed until later this week, when bankers expect the syndication to close. but while the terms are in line with the market, they are somewhat tight, bankers said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
