	<h3>oils and oilseeds traded quietly this afternoon and price movements were marginally mixed.     dutch soyoil showed small gains with support coming from early mark-ups in chicago soyoil futures.     firm argentine markets maintained levels in the sunflowerseed oil section but palm oil tended to move off early highs due to lack of buying support and the reported rejection of rbd oil offers by pakistan at its tender today.     demand for coconut oil and palm kernel oil faded and here again early gains were pared.     dutch soyoil traded at 65.50 guilders for may, rising to 71 for nov/jan deliveries ex-mill while any origin sunflowerseed oil sold at 346.50 dlrs for may/jul and 357.50 for aug/oct call ex-tank rotterdam.     no fresh trade was reported for coconut oil or palm kernel oil and palm oil also met an idle afternoon.     among oilseeds, april deliveries of u.k. rapeseed traded to boston, u.k. east coast, at 297 stg per tonne.  reuter &#3;</h3>
