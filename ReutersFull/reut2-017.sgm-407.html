	<h3>a bill that would impose an oil import fee to support a world floor price for oil of 25 dlrs a barrel was introduced in the u.s. house of representatives by 12 congressmen from oil-producing states.     the variable import fee would be dropped if oil prices rise above 25 dlrs a barrel, sponsors of the bill said.     revenues from the fee would be used to buy domestic oil from stripper wells - those that produce 10 barrels a day or less - at a fixed price of 25 dlrs a barrel. purchases would stop when prices rose above that level.     "time is running out on the domestic oil and gas industry," rep. joe barton, r-texas, said in a statement. "an oil import fee is really just the premium for a national insurance policy."     president reagan opposes an oil import fee, but supporters of the bill said they hoped for action on it before the end of the year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
