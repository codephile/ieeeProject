	<h3>west germany takes "very seriously" the recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote exchange rate stability around current levels, finance ministry state secretary hans tietmeyer said.     talking to journalists before a meeting of european community economy and finance ministers here, tietmeyer declined to say whether the february 22 paris accord by the group of five countries plus canada included secret agreements for stabilising currencies.     but he noted the official communique said the participants agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. "we're taking this sentence very seriously," he said.     tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against the mark since the meeting.     he said a slowdown in west german economic growth had been caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the paris agreement should help in this respect.     economics ministry state secretary otto schlecht said the bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and had not ruled out "appropriate and timely" action if necessary.     schlecht and tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion by the ec ministers of the latest ec commission report on the economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.     the commission has sharply revised down expected german gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct predicted last autumn and says bonn has the most room of any ec country to stimulate economic activity.     schlecht said the upturn in west germany's economy slowed in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1987. but he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in view that would make quick remedial action necessary.     he said a number of favourable indicators such as high level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up slightly during the course of the year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
