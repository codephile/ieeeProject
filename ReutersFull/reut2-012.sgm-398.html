	<h3>thai coffee exporters said they hoped the international coffee organisation (ico) would not reimpose export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in world prices.     susin suratanakaweekul, president of the thai coffee exporters association, told reuters that thailand obtained little benefit from previous ico quotas which represented only about 30 pct of its total annual exports.     thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if there are no restrictions on sales to current ico members who offer higher prices than non-members, he said.     the customs department said thailand exported 21,404 tonnes of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.     thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000 tonnes in the 1986/87 (oct/sept) season from 28,000 the previous year.     however, a senior commerce ministry official said the thai government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed ico quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.     somphol kiatpaiboon, director general of the commercial economics department, said an absence of ico quotas would encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market, further depressing prices.     he said indonesia is expected to export a substantial amount of coffee this month without such restrictions.  reuter &#3;</h3>
