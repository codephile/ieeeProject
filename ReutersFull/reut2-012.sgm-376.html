	<h3>beryl sprinkel, chairman of president reagan's council of economic advisors, denounced protectionism as a means of addressing the u.s.s' mounting trade imbalance and said stepped-up ecomonic growth would be a more effective means of reducing the deficit.     "rather than risking the outbreak of protectionism we should strive to reduce trade restrictions and to promote a more open system of international trade," sprinkel said.     sprinkel, in a speech delivered to the los angeles chamber of commerce, also said the budget deficit must be reduced through lower government spending in order to promote growth.  reuter &#3;</h3>
