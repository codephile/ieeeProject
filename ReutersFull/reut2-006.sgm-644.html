	<h3>president reagan, reacting to canadian concerns, today announced he will seek 2.5 billion dlrs over five years to combat acid rain.     the announcement said the administration will request from congress 500 mln dlrs in each of the next two fiscal years to fund innovative projects to control smokestack emissions -- blamed for acid rain that has killed fish and trees in eastern canada.     white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration had asked for 350 mln dlrs but that ottawa had registered concern about the level of funding.     he said the announcement was "obviously related" to an april-5-6 summit meeting in ottawa between reagan and canadian prime minister brian mulroney.     reagan said that in addition to committing government money industry would be encouraged to invest a greatwer or equal amount to promote new technologies to cut air pollution.     the announcement said an advisory panel, including state governmments and the canadian government, would advise on funding and selection of polllution control projects.     further, a presidential task force on regulatory relief would examine the effect of federal, state and local regulations on deployment of new emission control technologies.  reuter &#3;</h3>
