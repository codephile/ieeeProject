	<h3>the pakistani government allowed the private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy announced to cover the next three years.     commerce and planning minister mahbubul haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn.     cotton and rice are pakistan's main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations.     he said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. this would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
