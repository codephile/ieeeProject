	<h3>bethlehem steel corp said prices for steel sheet products will be increased up to 30 dlrs a ton effective january 3.     the increases will affect certain non-contract or spot transactions and will be achieved through reductions in competitive discounts.     the company said transaction prices for contract accounts, which have a duration of six months or more, will also be increased to commensurate levels.     percentage increases were not immediately available.     prices for flat-rolled steel sheet, used in automobiles, appliances and other products, vary widely between about 350 and 800 dlrs a ton.     the company said it was taking the actions to restore sheet transaction prices to more equitable levels. in many cases, prices are still lower than those attained in 1984, it said.     bethlehem also said that in response to changing market conditions and potential inflationary pressures, efforts will be made to mininize the number and the duration of firm price contracts.  reuter &#3;</h3>
