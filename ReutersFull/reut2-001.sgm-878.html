	<h3>the securities industry association endorsed legislation expected to come before the senate banking committee tomorrow imposing a moratorium on new powers for commercial banks.     robert gerard, managing director of morgan stanley and co, told reporters his group, which mainly represents investment banking firms, supported committee members who want the federal reserve board to postpone action on applications by three bank holding companies seeking new powers.     "the fed ought to hold those applications in abeyance pending congressional review," gerard said.          the legislation before the committee would recapitalize a federal desposit insurance fund for savings and loan associations and prohibit new nonbank banks.     gerard said the securities association had no position on nonbank banks.     the association wants congress to undertake a comprehensive study before changing the glass-steagall act, which separates commercial and investment banking activities, gerard said. until the study is completed, the fed should not act on the applications by citicorp, j.p. morgan and co. and bankers trust new york corp to underwrite and deal in securities, he said.        the study was likely to show substantial benefits from continuing the separation of commercial and investment banking, he said.     gerard said the group believes a proposal by house speaker jim wright for a tax on securities was unjustified and would hurt individual investors and beneficiaries of pension funds that invest in securities.     "it may reduce the volume of activity, but the tax is a tax on the saver and investor," gerard said.     in addition, a u.s. tax would drive business from the united states to other countries, he said.               reuter &#3;</h3>
