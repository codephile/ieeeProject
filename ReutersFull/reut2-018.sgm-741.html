	<h3>the international monetary fund said it has loaned uganda 92.1 mln dlrs to aid in economic recovery.     the fund said 60 mln dlrs of the loan is available through the so-called structural adjustment facility (saf) over the next three years.     the fund said 57.5 mln dlrs will be available immediately under the saf and a separate financing arrangement.     after expanding in the early 1980's, uganda's economy has suffered setbacks since 1984 of falling industrial and agricultural output and accelerating inflation, the fund said.     the current economic downturn has been worsened by the sharp decline in the world price of coffee, uganda's major export, the fund said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
