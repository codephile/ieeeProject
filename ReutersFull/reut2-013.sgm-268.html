	<h3>philippine coffee exports are expected to fall sharply due to a combination of the international coffee organisation's (ico) decision not to revive export quotas and higher local prices, ico certifying agency official dante de guzman told reuters.     he said exporter registrations dropped from an average weekly 500 tonnes in march to 45 tonnes last week, with exports in coffee year 1986/87, ending september, forecast to total about 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985/86.      "because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices, it has become difficult to service exports," de guzman said, adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude.     coffee production was expected to drop slightly to about one mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986/87 crop year ending june from 1.1 mln bags last year, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
