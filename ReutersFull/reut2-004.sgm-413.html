	<h3>a proposal the london metal exchange, lme, change its new clearing system, due to start may 29, was made today at a meeting of lme members and international commodities clearing house, icch, representatives.     amalgamated metal trading ltd, amt, proposed that a daily cash-cleared system common to all other markets should be adopted, rather than the system currently planned whereby prompt dates are settled when they mature.     amt claims the margin requirements for the latter will be costly.     opposition to the proposal came mainly from trade and industry representatives who, as traditional users of the exchange's hedging facilities, said a cash-cleared system would be more costly for them.     lme board chairman jacques lion said any major alterations to the planned new clearing system would have to be referred to the securities and investment board, sib, and this could be time consuming, bearing in mind the may 29 start-up.     there was also a risk of the exchange losing its greatest asset, its trade hedging business, he said.     lion accepted a proposal that, while clearing with the icch continue as planned, details of amt's cash clearing system be circulated for consideration and discussion by lme board, committee and members for possible introduction at a later date.     the lme also said that japanese yen contracts will now be excluded from clearing as they are not used widely enough to warrant inclusion.  reuter &#3;</h3>
