	<h3>high wage settlements in nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries, the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) said.     in denmark, the oecd said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness. sweden's competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages.     the oecd predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in denmark, as well as norway, sweden and finland.     overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988, the oecd semi-annual report said.     after a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic demand in norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year. denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand. the report said growth in gross domestic product (gdp) was likely to speed up slightly in sweden and finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in denmark and norway.     iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non-inflationary growth, the oecd said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
