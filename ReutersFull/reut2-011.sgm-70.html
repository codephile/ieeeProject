	<h3>florida's citrus groves continue in very good condition, acccording to the latest report by the u.s. department of agriculture's florida agricultural statistics service. late-week rains and thunderstorms came at an opportune time. warm daytime temperatures and good soil moisture have produced an abundance of new growth and bloom.     most trees are in some stage of bloom development with petal drop already taking place in many south florida groves.     harvest of late-type valencia oranges is increasing rapidly with the near completion of the early and midseason varieties. rain during the week caused some delay in picking.     for the week ended march 29, there were an estimated 77,000 boxes of early and midseason and 945,000 boxes of late season oranges harvested, the usda said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
