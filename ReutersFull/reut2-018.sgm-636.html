	<h3>dutch butter consumption rose at the expense of margarine last year partly because of the european community's (ec) cheap butter schemes, the commodity board for margarine, fats and oils (mvo), said.     butter consumption rose to 4.1 kilos per head in 1986 from four kilos in 1985, while margarine consumption including low fat margarine, fell to 14 kilos per head from 14.3 kilos.     the low fat margarine figure remained static at 2.6 kilos per head, while ordinary margarine fell from 11.7 kilos per head to 11.4 kilos.     however, cheap butter schemes may not be the only contributory factor in the changes. the mvo figures show a fairly steady rise in total butter consumption and fall in margarine consumption since 1973.     a graph produced in the mvo annual report shows total dutch margarine consumption in 1973 at just under 210,000 tonnes against around 165,000 in 1986.     the same graph shows total butter consumption in 1973 at just over 30,000 tonnes compared with just short of 60,000 tonnes last year.     however, during the same period total dutch edible fat and oil consumption on a fat content basis has risen from around 345,000 tonnes to 360,000 tonnes, or an average of 24.8 kilos per head in 1986.     the graph shows that most of the increase has come from butter and household cooking oil usage.  reuter &#3;</h3>
