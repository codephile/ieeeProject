	<h3>barclays bank plc <bcs.l> and midland bank plc <mdbl.l> said they are cutting their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. the cuts follow a similar move by national westminster bank plc <nwbl.l>     the rate changes take effect tomorrow.     the base rate reductions came after the bank of england cut its dealing rates this morning in a signal to the money markets that it would not resist a half percentage point drop in bank base lending rates, market sources said.     until the end of last week, the central was holding out staunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an apparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around the time of the government's annual budget on march 17.     sterling remained firm around 1.59 dlrs compared with its close here on friday at 1.5865 dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
