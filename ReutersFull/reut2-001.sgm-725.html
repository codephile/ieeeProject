	<h3>the canadian government's reduced borrowing needs enabled the bank of canada to make "aggressive use" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report.     the report, authored by retired governor gerald bouey, also noted advances to canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in january, 1986, and that the country's economy performed unevenly while inflation remained a major concern.     bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the reliance on canada savings bonds while raising substantailly more through short term treasury bill financings.     "the aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances and lower financing costs," said bouey who was replaced by deputy governor john crow last month.     the amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was 69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.     the reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing requirements, a run down in ottawa's cash balances, and generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange transactions.     also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to five year maturities, bouey said.     bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of december from a peak of 5.2 billion dlrs in march, 1986.     the advances were made largely to four banks, canadian commercial bank, northland bank, continental bank of canada and the bank of british columbia. the first two banks have been liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the advances.  reuter &#3;</h3>
