	<h3>u.s. energy futures posted modest gains because of a supply squeeze in physical north sea brent crude oil and escalation of the iran/iraq war, traders and analysts said.     may crude closed 17 cts higher to 18.84 dlrs.     "energy futures were led by the 15-day forward brent crude market in europe, said robert murphy, account executive at e.f. hutton and company inc, adding, "crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong," he added.     april brent rose as high as 19.57 dlrs a barrel today.     traders said reports that iran opened a new southern front and iraq attacked iranian oil fields were also supportive.     murphy said tonight's american petroleum institute report will need to show drawdowns in gasoline and distillate of two to four mln barrels each to support firmer crude prices.     "there is a lot of gasoline around," murphy said.     following crude futures, may gasoline closed 0.33 cent higher at 53.27 cts a gallon after trading 8,700 contracts. may heating oil traded only 7,200 contracts and was up 0.45 cent at 49.24 cts.  reuter &#3;</h3>
