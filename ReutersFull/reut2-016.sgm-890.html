	<h3>damon corp's damon clinical laboratories expects to report "significantly better" profits this year and a 20 pct gain in sales due in part to increased testing for aids virus, damon president joe isola said.      last year the unit earned 8.6 mln dlrs on sales of 97.3 mln for the fiscal year ended august 31, 1986. overall, damon corp reported a loss of 2.5 mln dlrs on sales of 148 mln.      isola attributed the loss to the company's biotechnology subsidiary.      damon labs currently tests about 8,000 samples a night for the aids virus at its irving, texas, facility. that's an increase of about 100 percent from 18 months ago when the u.s. army chose the company to test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome among its recruits.      now, in addition to recruits, the company processes regular army soldiers undergoing annual physicals, army reserves, the national guard as well as some coast guard and naval reserves.      despite having a capacity for processing 10,000 samples a day, damon labs recently decided to move out of its irving facility into a larger one close by and from april 25 on will be able to process some 16,000 a day.      he said aids testing was expected to contribute 18 mln dlrs to sales over the next three to four years, adding that some 80 pct of the aids testing was military-related.      despite the enormous number of tests being processed each day, he said there had never been a mistake.  reuter &#3;</h3>
