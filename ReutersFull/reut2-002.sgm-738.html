	<h3>the central bank recommended a major change in the traditional ownership structure of swedish commercial banks that bankers said would inevitably lead to the takeover of remaining small regional banks.     the recommendation was prompted by a recent proposal by the <proventus> financial group to create a new holding company that will control the third-largest commercial bank <gotabanken and wermlandsbanken>, a small regional bank.     the central bank gave its approval and said financial groups should be allowed to have banking subsidiaries as long as the groups did not include industrial or trading companies.     the central bank was commenting on a proposed new bill governing swedish financial groups.     it recommended that insurance companies should not be allowed to own banks until a separate inquiry into the problem was completed. sweden's two biggest insurance companies have both said they would like to enter the banking business.     sweden's commercial banks on the other hand have long wanted to buy up insurance companies.     bankers said the recommendations would mainly bring the rules up to date with new circumstances created by the extensive de-regulation of the swedish financial markets since 1982.     bankers said it was clear that others would follow the proventus example and that this would lead to a shake-up in the banking system with the remaining small regional banks being absorbed by larger banking groups.     the central bank also recommended banks be allowed to operate their stockbroking departments as subsidiaries, which bankers said would lead to banks taking over small stockbroking firms. banks have long complained the ban on splitting off the broking departments forced them to operate at a disadvantage because they could not match the partnerships and large salaries stockbrokers could offer their staff.  reuter &#3;</h3>
