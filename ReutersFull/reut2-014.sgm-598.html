	<h3>u.s. debt futures closed down and near daily lows after a choppy session.     continued weakness in the dollar pressured the market. bearish sentiment prevailed despite remarks made by federal reserve chairman paul volcker that a further large drop in the dollar could be counterproductive to the world economy.     new agreements by the g-5 and g-7 nations, which are meeting this week, on stabilizing currency rates are expected to have little effect on the market, traders said.     june t-bonds again failed to take out resistance at 98-16/32 as well as fill a chart gap between 98-25/32 and 99-16/32.     cbt t-bonds closed 28/32 to 30/32 point lower, t-notes fell 20/32 and muni bonds ended down one point. imm t-bills ranged from 7 basis points lower to 2 basis points higher and eurodollars closed down 6 to 11 basis points.  reuter &#3;</h3>
