	<h3>the united states may lift an additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against japan later this month, reagan administration officials said.     president reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on japanese goods last april for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the u.s. and third country markets and to open its home market to u.s. goods.     the move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and portable computers.     reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last june  after japan ended selling the semiconductors on the u.s. market at below production costs.     semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.     the administration officials said commerce department  monitors showed that japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking sales away from american-made semiconductors.     they said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month.     the united states and japan remain at odds over opening the closed japanese markets to u.s. goods.     u.s. and japanese officials reviewed japan's compliance with the agreement earlier this week.     the periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.  reuter &#3;</h3>
