	<h3>plans to rejuvenate poland's economy by reducing central government control would help reassure western creditors that the country's economy was safe to invest in, a senior polish official said.     "the business of granting loans to poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine," senior polish government spokesman jerzy urban told a news conference in stockholm.     urban, visiting the swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the foreign policy institute, announced earlier this week that poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive.     this was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said.     urban said the main problem with his country's foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but  the long term looked more secure.     he said he hoped talks under way with the paris club, grouping poland's main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing.     urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would "open new vistas for polish exports."     he criticised the blocking efforts of some western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation.     "after the lifting of u.s. sanctions against the polish economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed, but that has not been the case," urban said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
