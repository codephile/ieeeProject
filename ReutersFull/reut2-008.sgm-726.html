	<h3>the yugoslav government has decided to amend a wage-freeze law that triggered nationwide strikes and led the prime minister to threaten to use troops if the unrest threatened the ruling communist party.     the law, which returned wages to the average levels of the last quarter of 1986, triggered a huge wave of strikes and labor unrest throughout yugoslavia and a chorus of disapproval from company bosses and union officials. some 70 strikes by thousands of workers erupted nationwide.     the official tanjug news agency reported last night the government said the law, initially covering all firms in the country, would be amended for seasonal industries and for companies which raised wages "rationally" last year. it did not say what the amendments would be.  reuter &#3;</h3>
