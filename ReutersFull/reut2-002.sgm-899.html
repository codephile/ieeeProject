	<h3>exxon corp said that forgeries of a 20-year zero-coupon euronote issued by its exxon capital corp subsidiary have been discovered in the european market.     the issue involved was launched in 1984 and matures on november 15, 2004. about 1,900 notes with a total face value of 19 mln dlrs and a market value of about four mln dlrs have been identified so far, the company said.     exxon said that morgan guaranty trust co, the fiscal and paying agent for the issue, euro-clear and cedel (the two major european securities clearing systems), and police in london and brussels are investigating the case.     indications of forgeries came to light on wednesday at morgan guaranty trust co in london, which acts as euro-clear's depositary, and exxon said they were confirmed today.     euro-clear told exxon that it has examined to its satisfaction all the notes at the depositary and is checking the authenticity of new deposits of the notes as they enter the euro-clear system.     cedel is also reviewing all notes within its system, exxon added. at exxon's direction, morgan guaranty trust co stands ready to validate any notes in order to establish their authenticity, exxon said.     a spokeswoman for exxon was unable to say whether secondary-market trading in the notes had been affected or who would have legal responsibility for reimbursing defrauded investors.     zero-coupon forgeries have turned up in the euromarket before. because there are no interest coupons attached to the bond certificates, they are easier to forge than coupon issues, market sources said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
