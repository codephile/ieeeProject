	<h3>securities and exchange commission chairman john shad said the sec's investigations of insider-trading on wall street will broaden to include other types of securities law violations.     shad, appearing on cable news network's moneyline program, said the sec staff will "go down every avenue" in which it finds violations of securities laws.     he said the sec staff will investigate "many more ancillary areas." these, he said, include stock "parking" to avoid required sec filings on stock holdings of more than five pct and failures by brokerage firms to meet net capital requirements.      reuter &#3;</h3>
