	<h3>house energy and commerce committee chairman john dingell, d-mich, said the securities and exchange commission should step up its enforcement of regulations which require companies to disclose corporate fraud and waste.     dingell made the comment at the start of a hearing on alleged overcharges by trw inc on its defense contracts.     he said the sec seemed to have stopped demanding such disclosures, which are required by securities laws.     "in the wake of the foreign bribery cases in the 1970s, the sec instituted a vigorous program of self-policing, using external auditors, investigators, and counsel. it should do so again," dingell said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
