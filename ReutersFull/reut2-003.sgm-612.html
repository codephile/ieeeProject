	<h3>finland's mining and metals group outokumpu oy <outo.he>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of 83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt to rationalize production and improve profitability.     outokumpu's managing director pertti voutilainen told a news conference the reorganization involved a split of the division into a new independent division with six profit centres.     outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. it had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982.     outokumpu acquired two swedish copper manufacturers in january 1986, <metallverken ab> and <wirsbo bruks ab>, that were merged into its copper processing division.     the division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last year, 42 pct of outokumpu's group turnover of 7.58 billion.     the new outokumpu division, called copper products industry, is to incorporate outokumpu's copper production plants, including its two u.s. subsidiaries <nippert co> and <valleycast inc>, as well as metallverken and part of wirsbo.     outokumpu is planning to make wirsbo an independent division in the outokumpu group and transfer only wirsbo's copper tube production into one of the new division's profit centres. a definite decision on wirsbo will be taken later this year.     the new division will have production plants in finland, sweden, norway, the netherlands and the u.s.  reuter &#3;</h3>
