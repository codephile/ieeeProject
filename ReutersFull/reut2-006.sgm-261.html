	<h3>an inland revenue ruling accompanying today's u.k. budget would eliminate a favourable tax treatment on certain foreign loans by british banks and may be a "nightmare" of practical application, banking sources said.     this is because banks will only be able to offset the tax credit for foreign withholding tax paid on the interest they receive against the corporation tax on the profit of a specific loan. currently, the tax credit is calculated against a banks profits as a whole.     for banks, compliance with the ruling could indeed be a nightmare since they don't fund loans on a individual basis.     many of the loans that would be affected by the tax change are those to less developed countries, such as those in latin america. bankers could not estimate how many loans were involved expect to suggest it was a "sizable number."     in a statement, the inland revenue said that on loans made on or after april 1, the new measures would apply to interest arising from that date. on existing loans at that date, the measures would apply to interest arising from april 1, 1988.     government sources noted that the existing treatment of withholding tax on interest has enabled some banks to reduce interest rates on overseas loans, thereby lowering the revenue to the u.k. treasury.     the new measures, they said, are designed to  reduce the subsidy given to overseas lending through the tax system and bring the u.k. system more into line with those of overseas competitors.     the inland revenue estimated that the income to the treausry would be negligible in 1987/88 but could build up over time from about 20 mln stg in 1988/89 to 60 mln stg in 1990/91.     but while compliance with the new measures could necessitate hours of clerical work, bankers said the end return to the treasury may not prove as lucrative as anticipated.     they noted that most documentation accompanying these loans contains a clause allowing for a loan to be restructured if the tax treatment changes. however, they were unsure to what extent the loans would and could be changed.     bankers said they would seek clarification from the inland revenue, particularly on how to calculate the cost of these loans. revenue said it hopes to keep costs of compliance to a minimum.  reuter &#3;</h3>
