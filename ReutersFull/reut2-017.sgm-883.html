	<h3>nixdorf computer ag <nixg.f> plans a sharp expansion of its activities in the united states, deputy management board chairman arno bohn said.     he told a news conference that in the medium term nixdorf wanted to raise its u.s. turnover to one billion marks from a current 300 mln and aimed to employ some 5,000 people in its u.s. operations, compared with 1,300 now.     nixdorf's world group turnover was 4.50 billion marks in 1986. bohn said a major order last year from a u.s. retailer was a decisive element behind current plans for expansion.     retail chain montgomery ward and co inc, a unit of mobil corp <mob>, awarded a 100 mln dlr order to nixdorf in july last year for point-of-sales computer terminals.     bohn said that by 1990 there should be a total 15,000 cash terminals and 500 computer terminals in place in all of the 290 stores of montgomery ward.     nixdorf has said previously that, more important than the supply of the hardware for these systems, is the fact that nixdorf is also providing the relevant software.  reuter &#3;</h3>
