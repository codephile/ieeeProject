	<h3>a texas state court of appeal agreed that texaco inc's bankruptcy petition effectively stays the company's obligation under texas law to post a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr litigation against pennzoil co <pzl>.     in a brief hearing before a three-judge appeals court, texaco attorney james sales said the company's motion to reduce the amount of bond required to appeal the case was moot because texaco's chapter 11 petition protects the company from all previously existing debts and obligations.     lawyers for pennzoil, which won the 10.53 billion dlr judgment in a struggle over texaco's acquisition of getty oil co, did not object.     texaco lawyers said they planned to pursue the appeal in texas courts and in federal courts, if necessary.     the texaco lawyers said the company would seek permission from the bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york to pursue the pennzoil litigation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
