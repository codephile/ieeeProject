	<h3>the farm credit system will need 3-4.5 billion dlrs in federal assistance to cover losses over the next three years, a member of the board of the system's regulatory agency said.     jim billington, member of the three-person board of directors of the farm credit administration, said he intended to ask the board on may 5 to vote to certify that the ailing farm lending network needs federal aid.     billington, the sole democrat on the board, said the system would need federal aid sooner than suggested by a fca report, which said assistance would be required by the end of 1987.     "i would say the system will require outside financial assistance possibly by july 1 if system districts don't lend unsecured credit to one another to meet collateral problems," he said.     fca officials today disclosed that efforts by the system's districts to reach a collateral-sharing agreement has been suspended.  reuter &#3;</h3>
