	<h3>rising interest rates and protectionist trade policies had prompted a new push by latin american nations to win debt relief, regional foreign and finance ministry officials said here.     officials of the cartagena group of 11 debtor nations met here this week to draw up new proposals in reaction to what they called a deteriorating world panorama, and citicorp's decision to create reserves against third world loans.     (see ecra for spotlight headlines)     "we are looking at trade, interest rates and financial flows.....in order to put forward a basis for some permanent solutions," mexico's public credit director angel gurria said.     recent developments have led to moves for a summit of latin american presidents and debate on new solutions.     ideas include schemes to link debt payments to trade, and proposals for stable interest rates. the latter was proposed in a letter this week from cartagena to g-7 leaders who are due to attend a summit in venice this month.     another idea is to include debt under gatt negotiations, but cartegena ministers have yet to endorse any proposals.     speaking earlier in new york, uruguay's foreign minister and cartagena group chairman enrique iglesias said citicorp's decision could discourage new lending. but it might help cartagena's bid to have old and new debt treated separately.     the cartagena group, which has not met at ministerial level for over a year, wants to repay debt contracted before the debt crisis at the low interest rates prevailing in the 1970s. it would pay new loans at current market rates.     "many countries fear that what they have gained in months of arduous debt negotiations they can lose at a stroke with a one point rise in interest rates," one official here said.     "the new increase in interest rates has come precisely when we thought they had still not come down enough," iglesias said.     latin american officials are also concerned that varying interest spreads granted to different debtor nations could generate discord, as with the philippines' recent protest at being given less favourable terms than argentina.     there has been speculation venezuela would demand a cut in its 7/8 pct spread, but public finances director jorge marcano said here there were no plans to renegotiate terms.     this week's meeting came after three latin american presidents meeting in montevideo called for stable interest rates on the region's 380 billion dlr foreign debt. it was called to review developments since the last ministerial meeting in february 1986 and to think up new ideas.     since the last ministerial meeting there have been some advances, such as mexico's growth-oriented 77 billion dlr loan and refinancing package agreed last september. but there have also been setbacks, like brazil's payments moratorium.     the loans expected in the baker plan have not materialized and debtors have been forced to browbeat reluctant banks.     "we have clearly stretched the restructuring process to its limits and and the question is now where do we go from here?" a senior mexican foreign ministry official said.     existing debt strategy has been based on nursing debtor economies back to a position where they can again service their debts and qualify for new loans.     but after five years of economic adjustment, latin american debtors are currently unable to raise voluntary credits, with the exception of colombia. only venezuela is paying back principal. most countries have no prospect of paying their debts in the foreseeable future.     citicorp has made clear its decision to move three billion dlrs to reserves does not mean it is writing-off the loans.     latin american officials here said citicorp's move would probably boost trading of discounted third world debt in the secondary market, implicitly downvaluing the amount owed. but they said it might make new lending even more remote.     discounted debt can be bought by foreign investors through debt-equity schemes that generate new resources for debtor economies. chile and mexico are currently front-runners in this field, but most latin american officials see these schemes as limited and no panacea for the overall problem.     most latin officials set greater store on building up export income than on debt-equity schemes.     exports hit 97.7 billion dlrs in 1984, cutting the region's debt service ratio to 36 pct, but they fell to 78.3 billion last year. so, even though interest rates had dropped the ratio hardly changed.     the cartagena group has called for the debt-trade link to be recognized before, but has not made detailed proposals.     officials said initiatives discussed here would be submitted to foreign and finance ministers of the 11 nations, before imf and world bank annual meetings later this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
