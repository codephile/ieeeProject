	<h3>the nuclear regulatory commission said its staff has ordered philadelphia electric co to shut down the peach bottom nuclear power plant at delta, pa.     the nrc noted that one peach bottom unit is shut down for refuling and said the other must be brought to cold shutdown within 36 hours. neither unit may be restarted without the commission's approval, the regulatory body said.     the nrc said it received information on march 24 that control room operators at peach bottom had been observed sleeping while on duty in the control room.     it said the information indicated this conduct was pervasive and has been occurring for some time, and that shift supervision had knowledge of this situation.     in response to this information, the regulators said, they initiated 24-hour inspection coverage of the plant's control room, which is ongoing.     to date, the nrc said, its inspection has established operations control room staff has at times during various shifts, particularly the 2300 to 0700 shift, slept or otherwise been inattentive to duties over the past five months.     the commission said it also found management either knew and condoned the sleeping and inattention, or should have known about it, and either took no action or inadequate action to correct this situation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
