	<h3>international business machines corp said it introduced four new personal computers, including a top of the line unit based on the powerful intel corp <intc> 80386 chip.     the company said the new pc's are compatible with most existing ibm pc applications.               the new computers, which mark the first major overhaul of the ibm pc line since the company entered the business in 1981, include a pc based on the intel corp <intc> 80386 microprocessor, making it the most powerful ibm pc to date.     also included is an intel 8086 based system which ibm said is up to two and a half times as fast as its ibm pc xt model.     ibm also introduced two new versions of its pc at system. these use an intel 80286 chip running at 50 pct faster than the existing ibm pc at.     the new line of pc's, which ibm calls the personal system/2, uses 3.5 inch diskettes instead of the conventional 5.25 inch diskettes.     the company said the smaller diskettes store from two to four times more data than larger diskette, which typically handle 360 kilobytes of data.     ibm said the new pc at's and the 80386-based pc use a new ibm-designed 32-bit data bus. this carries data internally within the pc.     the company said the new bus offers processing power up to two to three-and-a-half times the existing ibm pc at.     ibm said the new pc's can run a new operating system, called ibm dos version 3.3, which is now available.     the company also said it will offer a second operating system, called ibm operating system/2, developed jointly with microsoft corp <msft>. this will be available in stages, beginning in the first quarter of 1988.     ibm said operating system/2 will for the first time give ibm pc users the ability to access multiple applications and very large programs and amounts of data.     ibm said said its personal system/2 model 30, which is an intel 8-megahertz (mhz) 8086-based system, is now available at a list price of 1,695 dlrs each with two diskette drives and for 2,295 dlrs with one diskette and one 20-megabyte fixed disk drive. the unit weighs 17 pounds.     it said an 8087 math coprocessor that runs at the same eight mhz rate as the 8086 is available.     the company said the personal system/2 model 50, an intel 10 mhz 80286-based desktop system, is now available at a cost of 3,595 dlrs.     ibm said said its personal system/2 model 60, which is also an intel 10 mhz 80286-based system, is a floor-standing system available in two configurations. this system, which is scheduled for availability in the second quarter, lists at 5,295 dlrs with a 44mb fixed disk drive and 6,295 dlrs on the 70mb fixed disk drive.     the company said the personal system/2 80 is the most powerful member of the new family of pc's, using an intel 80386-based mocroprocessor. the floor-standing machine will be available in three configurations.     ibm said one model 80 configuration, scheduled for july availability at a cost of 6,995 dlrs, runs at 16 mhz, contains 1mb of memory and features a 44mb fixed disk drive.     a second configuration, also scheduled for july at 8,495 dlrs each, runs at 16 mhz and has 2mb of memory and a 70mb fixed disk drive.     the company said the third model 80 is scheduled for the fourth quarter and features ibm-designed one-megabit memory technology. expected to cost 10,995 dlrs, it runs at 20 mhz and features 2mb of memory and a 115 mb fixed disk drive.         ibm said its personal system/2 incorporates enhanced integrated graphics functions including significantly improved text, expanded colors up to 256 out of a palette of more than 256,000, and sharper business graphics.     the company said the models 50, 60 and 80 video graphics array supports 640 x 480 x 16 colors in graphics mode and 720 x 400 x 16 colors in text mode. it will also support the new 320 x 200 x 256 color mode.     with the addition of the new advanced graphics feature, ibm said, 1024 x 768 addressability also can be obtained.  reuter &#3;</h3>
