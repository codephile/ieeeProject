	<h3>rep. john lafalce, d-n.y., has introduced a bill to create an international debt adjustment facility to deal with third world debt.     he said in a statement the facility would purchase debt of a debtor nation at a discount and then sell the loans to private investors. lafalce said the facility could use funds of the world bank and international monetary fund as collateral to for the necessary financial banking to issue debt instruments.     lafalce, a member of the house banking committee, said the facility was needed because most american banks were refusing to fund more foreign debt and debtor countries were having trouble paying the loans on schedule.  reuter &#3;</h3>
