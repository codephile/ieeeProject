	<h3>nigeria will issue april 7 1.5 billion dlrs in short-term promissory notes to its uninsured trade creditors in connection with existing arrears on those debts, law debenture trust corp plc said as trustee for the notes.     it said nigeria also plans to hold talks with a newly appointed representative for those creditors fairly soon, and that nigeria will call "at an early date" an extraordinary meeting of noteholders, including holders of the new notes. the purpose of that meeting will be to consider a resolution to the arrears on the trade debt and the promissory notes.     nigeria missed the first principal payment due on the notes last autumn and another payment of about 30 mln dlrs that was due in early january because of a cash shortage, which stemmed partly from the drop in oil prices last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
