	<h3>saudi arabia's economy is showing signs of picking up after problems last year caused by the steep fall in oil prices, commerce minister suleiman abdulaziz al-salim said.     salim told a conference of saudi businessmen the government had taken a bold step to stimulate the economy by drawing down more than 50 billion riyals of reserves in its 1987 budget.     salim said one tangible sign of that optimism had been a strong rise in the price of saudi shares. some have gained by more than 35 pct since last november.     but the keynote speaker, prince khaled al-faisal, accused saudi businessmen of ingratitude because they preferred to invest abroad rather than in saudi arabia.     the need to increase private investment in saudi arabia is expected to be a major theme of the conference.     saudi arabia's economic planners have long recognised the need to stimulate the private sector and diversify the oil-dependent economy.     but despite the encouraging signals cited by salim, some businessmen and bankers said they are still sceptical about prospects for the economy.  reuter &#3;</h3>
