	<h3>amoco corp's wholly owned amoco canada petroleum co ltd said its proposed 5.22-billion- canadian-dlr acquisition of dome petroleum ltd will benefit canada just like the foreign investment that made possible commercial development of alberta's oilsands.     amoco canada president t. don stacy told an oilsands conference that "amoco canada has presented the solution to the dome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and determination to make that solution work."     the amoco buyout of debt-burdened dome has angered canadian nationalists, who want a canadian buyer for dome.     stacy described amoco canada's previously reported share offer proposal as a chance to increase canadian ownership of the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.     he reiterated that amoco planned virtually no layoffs of dome employees. he also reaffirmed that amoco would reinvest in amoco canada-dome properties all available cash flow for five years after the acquisition.  reuter &#3;</h3>
