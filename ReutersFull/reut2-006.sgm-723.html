	<h3><bralorne resources ltd> said it reached agreement in principle with its long term lenders for a debt rescheduling plan.     when the agreements are finalized, bralorne's debt structure will be modified so that debt servicing requirements match available cash flow for each of the next three years.     during that period, principal payments will be deferred, if necessary, and interest will be capitalized on a portion of the long term debt, it said.     bralorne said it expects these agreements will enable the company to operate within its cash flows and provide a stable financial environment until the energy industry recovers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
