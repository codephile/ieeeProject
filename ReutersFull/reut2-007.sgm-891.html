	<h3>high interest rates, sluggish global economic growth and creeping protectionism are deepening the third world debt crisis, senior mexican officials said.     finance minister gustavo petricioli said today's signing of a 76 billion dlr new-loan and rescheduling package for mexico was the most comprehensive and far-reaching effort in debt management yet achieved for a sovereign borrower.     but, in remarks prepared for the signing ceremony, he warned against complacency. "the debt problem is not solved. if anything, it has been exacerbated by recent events."     "the inequities of the international economic environment conspire against the welfare and stability of developing countries," petricioli added. the debt problem will not be solved unless developing countries are allowed to grow, he argued. "there will be no solution without the further development of trade throughout the world.".     director of public credit angel gurria told reporters that mexico's economy should resume growth this year, but he said external conditions are not favorable. latin america is grappling with adverse terms of trade, for instance, as underlined by the recent slide in coffee prices.     interest rates remain unacceptably high in real terms, gurria added. "inflation has literally disappeared from the face of the earth in the industrialized world, but interest rates are still near seven pct."     industrial powers must also improve the coordination of their economic policies to boost unacceptably low growth rates and to keep export markets open, said gurria, who is mexico's chief debt negotiator.     the officials also had a blunt warning for those banks that refuse to participate in the loan package: do not expect to get much business with mexico in the future.     about 60 of mexico's 430 or so creditor banks worldwide have still to join the loan, but four more acceptances were received today, according to senior citibank executive william rhodes, who is co-chairman of mexico's advisory committee.     "those who supported us today can be sure that mexico will continue to be open and willing to share with them the business opportunities which its future growth will create.     "those few who have denied their responsibility have turned their backs on this remarkable effort of international cooperation, on the financial system and on their enlightened colleagues," petricioli said.     one way that mexico could punish recalcitrant banks would be to deny, or at least slow down, applications to convert mexican debt into equity investments within the country.     "we will be a lot more expeditious in processing the requests of banks that have supported us," gurria said, adding, "we have long memories."     debt-equity conversions are an attractive way for banks to provide clients with subsidized pesos for investment in mexico and to collect handsome brokerage fees or reduce their own mexican exposure in the process.         the growing popularity of the scheme was underlined this week when american express bank, which has joined the new mexican package, said it plans to convert 100 mln dlrs of its own loans into an equity stake in hotel projects in mexico.     mexico halted the debt-equity program on feb. 25 to force banks to concentrate on wrapping up the financing pakcage, and gurria said it would resume once the first part of the six billion dlr loan that forms the core of the deal is disbursed.     the loan is now 99 pct subscribed. gurria said mexico hopes to close the books by the middle of april in time for a drawdown by the end of april.     although the agreements were signed in the sumptuous surroundings of a midtown manhattan hotel, the atmosphere of the signing ceremony was rather subdued, with bankers and officials showing little of the elation and relief that normally follows the conclusion of a mammoth deal.     after five months of arduous work syndicating the loan, debt fatigue was apparent and the talk was of ways to make the financing process less cumbersome.     "this (package) has been harder than all the others... i hope we find a way that's not so debilitating for the people who have to put them together," gurria said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
