	<h3>ecuadorean president leon febres cordero said his country was unilaterally suspending payments to private foreign banks due to last week's earthquake which caused up to one billion dollars in damage.     febres cordero, quoted in an information ministry communique, said: "we have to ratify this suspension ... on debt service to the private international banks.     "i am not ashamed to say it, there definitely isn't a way to pay," he said.     ecuador had already suspended payments to private foreign banks, holding two-thirds of ecuador's 8.16 billion dollar foreign debt, from last january due to a cash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices last year.     but finance officials had earlier said the length of the suspension would depend on negotiations with private foreign banks.     the information ministry communique said febres cordero made these statments to reporters at lago agrio, at the heart of ecuador's region of jungle oilfields, before returning to quito.     febres cordero said up to a total of 1,000 people died or were missing in avalanches and mudslides during the march 5 earthquake.     the tremor damaged an oil pipeline, thus barring all crude exports for a projected five months. oil accounts for up to two-thrids of ecuador's total exoprts and for as much as 60 per cent of the government's revenues.     he did not specify for how long the suspension of payments would last.     ecuador owes private foreign banks 450 to 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of the year and 66 mln dlrs in principal payments maturing in 1987, finance officials said.     finance minister domingo cordovez said two days ago the government seeks to postpone all the payments due to private foreign banks in 1987 until next year through negotiations with these creditors.  reuter &#3;</h3>
