	<h3>u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter suggested the u.s. could file a formal complaint with the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) challenging canada's decision to impose duties on u.s. corn imports.     asked about the canadian government decision to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on u.s. corn shipments, yeutter said the u.s. could file a formal complaint with gatt under the dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code.     other u.s. options would be to appeal the decision in canadian courts, or to retaliate against canadian goods, a lower-level u.s. trade official said. however, retaliation is an unlikely step, at least initially, that official said. no decision on u.s. action is expected at least until after documents on the ruling are received here later this week.  reuter &#3;</h3>
