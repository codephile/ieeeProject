	<h3>fabrique nationale herstal sa <fnhb.br> said it suffered a net loss of 2.99 billion francs last year after being hit by strikes, the falling dollar and declining oil prices.     an fn statement said the loss, which compared with a 6.8 mln franc profit the previous year, included considerable charges for restructuring in 1986 and 1987. without these the net loss would have been 1.45 billion francs, it said.     it added that the restructuring plan would allow the firm to return to long term profitability once it had been approved by local authorities, banks and the workforce.  reuter &#3;</h3>
