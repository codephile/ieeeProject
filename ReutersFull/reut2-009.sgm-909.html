	<h3>the french government will present to parliament a major bill within two months to overhaul the paris stock market, economics and finance minister edouard balladur said.     balladur told an economist conference that on the product side, a series of new contracts, including share options and forward contracts in european currency units (ecus), would be introduced shortly for trading on the paris bourse.     the scope of the new bill, however, was to transform the organisation of equity trading, allowing participants both to perform a banking role and to trade in equities, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
