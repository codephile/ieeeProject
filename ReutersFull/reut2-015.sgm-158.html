	<h3>public service co of colorado said it has reached a preliminary agreement to resolve a territorial dispute with union rural electric association of brighton, colo.     the company said, "the tentative agreement protects union's boundaries and also would set in motion a vote of union's membership, which could lead to acquisition of union by public service co."     union provides electrical service to about 14,000 members in cities and rural areas north of denver.     the company said the settlement, which is pending before the colorado public utilities commission, is under review by the tri-state generation and transmission association, which supplies power to union, and is subject to approval by the public service colorado board and union's membership. it also will be discussed with the colorado rural electric association.     it said legislation that would halt the acquisition of electric utility service territories by annexation will remain active in the colorado house of representatives until union and public service assure legislators they are in agreement.  reuter &#3;</h3>
