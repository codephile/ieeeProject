	<h3><electricite de france> (edf) will make its first offering of euro-commercial paper in the international market on monday, edf chief financial officer daniel lallier said in a telephone call from paris.     the program was announced in late january and dealers expect the company will be pushing to maintain its ability to obtain some of the finest terms available in the international markets.     lallier did not say how much would be offered, although he has noted that edf would be cautious because it believes the market is still in its infancy. in january he said edf may not issue more than 300 to 500 mln dlrs of paper this year.     edf plans to oversee the program itself, with goldman sachs international corp, morgan guaranty ltd and salomon brothers international ltd acting as dealers for the general program, which will be aimed at institutional and retail investors.     union bank of switzerland will act as dealer for a specific program, which is aimed at smaller retail investors.  reuter &#3;</h3>
