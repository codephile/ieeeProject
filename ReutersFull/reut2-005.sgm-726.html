	<h3>royal bank of canada's <ry> small brazilian commercial bank subsidiary banco royal do canada (brasil) s.a. sees opportunities for its own growth with an expected substantial increase in brazilian exports to canada, banco royal president michael brennan said.     "they (brazilian exporters) are very interested in the canadian market because it's an untapped market," brennan told reporters after a speech to the brazil/canada chamber of commerce.     brennan said brazil is currently exporting products like paper machinery and ships to canada.     he said he hopes to see medium-term financing facilities for brazilian companies reinstated shortly, following an agreement reached in january with international financial authorities.     brennan estimated brazilian exports to canada totalled roughly 800 mln canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from canada reached about 700 mln dlrs.     brennan said he expects banco royal profit to increase this year from the three mln u.s. dlrs reported for fiscal 1986 ended september 30 but said he could not predict by how much because of the country's uncertain financial climate.     brennan said he expects his bank's growth to come from increased exports to canada. banco royal is the only canadian-owned commercial bank in brazil although <bank of montreal> has a brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said.     brennan said he expected brazil to be able to reach an equitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68 billion u.s. dlr foreign debt, because the brazilian economy is essentially healthy. he said he believed brazil might be in a position to resume debt repayments within a year.     brennan said he could not comment on the impact of brazil's interest payment moratorium on the royal bank of canada.  reuter &#3;</h3>
