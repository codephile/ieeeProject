	<h3>malaysian miners criticised the u.s. for violating an agreement with southeast asian producers by selling more stockpiled tin in 1986 than agreed.     the u.s. general services administration sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes, the states of malaya chamber of mines said.     in its latest annual report, it said the u.s. had promised to limit sales of tin in a memorandum of understanding signed with the six-member association of southeast asian nations (asean) in december 1983.     "the u.s. appears to have lost sight of the u.s./asean memorandum of understanding," the chamber said.     the chamber estimated the u.s. strategic stockpile held 180,444 tonnes of tin in december 1986, 137,744 tonnes in excess of of its original stockpile goal of 42,700.     the main asean tin producers are malaysia, indonesia and thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's tin.  reuter &#3;</h3>
