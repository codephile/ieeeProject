	<h3>federal reserve board governor robert heller said that the dollar's current level is appropriate but declined to comment on widespread market reports of concerted central bank intervention this week.     "the dollar is stable again... the current level is the appropriate level," heller told reporters after a speech to a meeting of financial services analysts.     he said last month's six-nation currency accord in paris did not include target ranges for the dollar in an "academic way."     heller also said that it was too early to determine whether the parties to the six-nation accord were taking appropriate steps to carry out the longer-term economic adjustments agreed to in paris.     "clearly, they've not been implemented yet... no one expects implementation within a week or two," he said.     earlier today, u.s. treasury assistant secretary told a senate banking subcommittee that he did not believe that west germany and japan have yet carried out their international responsibilities.  reuter &#3;</h3>
