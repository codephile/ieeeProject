	<h3>surinam's military government opens a four-day congress tomorrow to discuss the country's deepening economic crisis, the official surinam news agency reported.     acting prime minister jules wijdenbosch will open the meeting which is being attended by government officials, political leaders and heads of labor unions.     surinam's economy has suffered a sharp downturn in recent months as a result of guerrilla activities led by former soldier ronny brunswijk, who is seeking to overthrow the government of commander desi bouterse.     the guerrillas have forced the shutdown of most of surinam's vital bauxite and aluminum industry, creating a foreign exchange crisis and food shortages.  reuter &#3;</h3>
