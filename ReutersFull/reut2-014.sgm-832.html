	<h3>indonesia expects crude palm oil (cpo) prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne fob sometime this year because of better european demand and a fall in malaysian output, hasrul harahap, junior minister for tree crops, told indonesian reporters.     prices of malaysian and sumatran cpo are now around 332 dlrs a tonne cif for delivery in rotterdam, traders said.     harahap said indonesia would maintain its exports, despite making recent palm oil purchases from malaysia, so that it could possibly increase its international market share.     indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil after malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure supplies during the moslem fasting month of ramadan.     harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary shortage than to lose export markets.     indonesian exports of cpo in calendar 1986 were 530,500 tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank figures.  reuter &#3;</h3>
