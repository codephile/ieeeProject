	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it affirmed the ratings on w.r. grace and co's 575 mln dlrs of debt following its fourth-quarter 1986 loss of 560 mln dlrs.     affirmed were the company's bbb-minus senior debt, bb-plus subordinated debt and a-3 commercial paper.     s and p pointed out that the fourth-quarter loss resulted from the write-off of nearly 600 mln dlrs in assets, especially in agricultural chemicals and natural resources.     because that write-off had no effect on grace's cash, s and p affirmed the current ratings, noting that grace intends to sell its agricultural business.     proceeds from the sale of the agricultural segment could be used to reduce grace's debt, standard and poor's said.     however, s and p said it is less clear whether grace can also extricate itself from the project debt from its phosphate mining joint venture at four corners.     despite today's rating affirmation, s and p cautioned that grace has greater-than-usual vulnerability to rating change in the next year or two.     "uncertainty abounds as to the firm's future ownership, management and direction," the rating agency said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
