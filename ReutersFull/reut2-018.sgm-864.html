	<h3>rio de janeiro's 3,500 dockworkers went on strike for an indefinite period today to demand wage increases, a spokesman for the dockers said.     the rio dockers did not get support from their colleagues in santos, brazil's main port, but the spokesman said they would not return to work unless their demands were met.     earlier this week, some 65,000 dockworkers cancelled a scheduled national strike to pressure port officials to give them a wage increase and other benefits.     a rio port spokesman said the halt would cause daily losses of about 100,000 u.s. dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
