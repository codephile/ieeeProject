	<h3>cominco ltd said it set tentative talks with three striking union locals that rejected on saturday a three-year contract offer at cominco's trail and kimberley, british columbia lead-zinc operations.     the locals, part of united steelworkers of america, represent 2,600 production and maintenance workers. no date has been set for the talks, the spokesman replied to a query.     the spokesman said talks were still ongoing with the two other striking locals, representing 600 office and technical workers. production at trail and kimberley has been shut down since the strike started may 9.     each of the five locals has a separate contract that expired april 30, but the main issues are similar.     the trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead last year, while the sullivan mine at kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at trail.     revenues from trail's smelter totaled 356 mln canadian dlrs in 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
