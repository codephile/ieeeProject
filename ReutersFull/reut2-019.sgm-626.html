	<h3>british airways plc's <bab.l> may passenger and cargo traffic figures provided evidence of recovery from last year's setbacks and this trend will be reflected in first quarter results due in august, chairman lord king told the annual meeting.     earlier this month, the newly-privatised airline reported a 29 pct rise in passenger traffic figures for may, with cargo traffic up 22 pct.     in the year to march, british airways reported a drop in pre-tax profits to 162 mln stg from 195 mln previously. however, king said this result was satisfactory, considering the difficulties posed by the chernobyl disaster and the u.s. raid on libya.     he said british airways intended to return its tour travel operations to profitability, when questioned by shareholders.     in 1986/87, this division reported an operating loss of nine mln stg, the fifth year of losses. however, he said the group might reconsider its course of action if a turnaround seemed unlikely in the long-term.  reuter &#3;</h3>
