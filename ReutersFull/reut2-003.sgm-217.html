	<h3>engineering industry employers in north rhine-westphalia state said they made an unprecedented offer on pay and working hours.     the offer, which came amid warning strikes by some 33,000 workers, was the first time since world war two that employers have proposed cutting working hours and is seen as averting a repeat of the nationwide strike of 1984 which brought the auto industry to a standstill for seven weeks, union sources said.     the employers propose a half-hour cut in the 38.5 hour working week from july 1, 1988 and a pay rise of 2.7 pct from april 1 and a further 1.5 pct from july 1, 1988.     the engineering union ig metall, europe's largest union, wants a five pct wage rise and a 35-hour week at full pay.     it called today's warning strikes, mostly involving work stoppages of up to one hour, after more than 50 rounds of talks since december failed.     the employers' offer was seen breaking the deadlock in negotiations, even though the union said the half-hour cut is not enough, union sources said.     the offer applies to workers in north rhine-westphalia and it was unclear if further offers would be presented in talks between unions and employers of other west german states.  reuter &#3;</h3>
