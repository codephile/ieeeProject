	<h3>brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis), the u.s. agriculture department's officer in sao paulo said in a field report.     the report, dated april 7, said the reduction is based on an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.     the center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes -- 25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.     hot, dry weather during part of january and excessive rains in some areas in february reduced yield prospects and may have affected quality, the report said.     nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in parana and slightly less in sao paulo, it said. cotton entering gins is of fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
