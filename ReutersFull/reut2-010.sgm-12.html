	<h3>four new outsiders were appointed to the policy-making council of the lloyd's of london insurance market, shifting the voting balance on the council away from lloyd's professionals, lloyd's said.     it said in a statement the appointments of the new members, none of them previously involved in the insurance market, were made to comply with the core recommendation in the neill report into regulation at lloyd's, which was published on january 22.     the recommendation, one of 70 to improve investor protection in the lloyd's market, was to reduce the number of elected working members, lloyd's professionals, from 16 to 12.     simultaneously, the number of outsiders would be increased by four while the number of external council members, usually lloyd's investors without an active role in the market, would remain unchanged at eight.  lloyd's said the four newly-appointed council members were barrister elizabeth mary freeman, sir maurice hodgson, non-executive chairman of british home stores plc, lloyd's bank plc chairman sir jeremy morse, and brian pomeroy, an accountant who sat on the three-member neill enquiry panel.     they replace the four lloyd's professionals who resigned on april 4 after lloyd's agreed to implement the recommendation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
