	<h3>toyota motor corp <toyo.t> is likely to name more american companies as suppliers of car parts for its wholly-owned u.s. subsidiary toyota motor manufacturing usa inc (tmm), a toyota official told reuters.     toyota is studying the use of general motors corp's <gm.n> gm delco products as a supplier of motors for windshield wipers and illinois tool works inc for window handles, he said. another u.s. firm may be used to supply radiator tanks.     toyota had originally planned to use two japanese companies to supply the parts, nippondenso co ltd <dnot.t> and aisin seiki co ltd.     toyota is also considering some other u.s. firms as suppliers, but the spokesman declined to name them.     cars produced at toyota's kentucky plant will consist of 60 pct local content, instead of an earlier planned 50 pct, he said. the plant is scheduled to start production in mid-1988 and have an annual capacity of 200,000 cars.     industry sources said the toyota move was designed to head off criticism that it was not using enough u.s. company-made parts at its kentucky plant.  reuter &#3;</h3>
