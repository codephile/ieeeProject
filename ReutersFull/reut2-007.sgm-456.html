	<h3>transportation secretary elizabeth dole proposed to allow the use of daytime running lights as a measure to improve safety on the highways.     dole said in an announcement that in sweden and finland,  where daytime lights have been in use, the number of crashes and lives lost has been reduced.     the transporation department said there might be confusion in some states whether the lighting device was legal.     therefore it proposed an amendment to federal motor vehicle safety rules to make clear that front-mounted lights could be installed at the option of the manufacturer.  reuter &#3;</h3>
