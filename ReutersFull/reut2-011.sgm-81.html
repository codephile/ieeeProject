	<h3>senators are considering offering a host of amendments to a farm disaster assistance bill which could come up soon on the senate floor, staff members said.     the bill, already passed by the house, would enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant.     amendments considered by sen. rudy boschwitz (r-minn.) would apply the so-called "0/92" option to all 1987 program crops or, if that failed, to spring wheat, senate staff said.     sens. robert dole (r-kan.) and charles grassley (r-iowa) were considering an amendment that would allow feedgrains producers to receive final deficiency payments in march instead of in october.     earlier this year dole said advancing the final deficiency payments would provide feedgrains producers with approximately three billion dlrs in income payments prior to spring planting instead of in the fall.     dole and grassley are also considering an amendment that would offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation reserve program last year.     the bonus payment has been offered to farmers signing up for the corn program this spring. the u.s. agriculture department has indicated it would oppose broadening the corn bonus offer.     sen. larry pressler (r-s.d.) was said to be contemplating an amendment that would offer the 0/92 option to spring wheat producers who were prevented from planting this spring because of flooding last year.     sen. david boren (d-okla.) was eyeing a measure that would allow cotton producers to receive disaster aid if the quality of their crop was hurt by flooding last year.     democrats and republicans today were still trying to arrive at an agreement governing time to be devoted to amendments.  reuter &#3;</h3>
