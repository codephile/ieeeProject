	<h3>ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake, is seeking through negotiations with private foreign banks to postpone all payments due to them for the rest of the year, finance minister domingo cordovez said.     he said in a statement, "the idea with the foreign banks is to obtain from them the best terms to give the ecuadorean economy a complete relief in the period of deferral of payments on the foreign debt during the present year."     the statement referred only to payments due to private foreign banks, a senior government finance official told reuters.     these creditors hold two-thirds of ecuador's foreign debt which totals 8.16 billion dlrs.     it did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governments and multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainder of ecuador's foreign debt, the official said.     he said ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450 and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 and about 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year.     cordovez said ecuador would seek new loans from multilateral organisations. a world bank mission was due here soon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said.     ecuador has also appealed for emergency aid from about 40 foreign governments.     government officials have calculated losses to the 1987 budget from last thursday's earthquake at 926 mln dlrs.     in 1986, ecuador's total service on the foreign debt was about 996 mln dlrs to all creditors.     the quake ruptured ecuador's main oil pipeline, suspending crude exports for five months until the line is repaired. oil accounts for up to two-thirds of its total exports and up to 60 pct of total revenues. before the tremor, ecuador suspended interest payments on january 31 to private foreign banks.     officials said they stopped interest payments due to a cash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices, which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs.     ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contact every day this week with some of the banks who sit on its 14-bank advisory committee, the senior government finance official said. the committee represents the country's 400 or so private foreign bank creditors.     cordovez also said in the statement, "the banks should perceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply with what was forseen."     cordovez added, ecuador must make a new proposal in line with the reality since the earthquake by seeking better options of deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions."     interest payments fall due at least monthly to private foreign banks.     ecuador's initial proposal earlier this year was to make only one semi-annual or one annual interest payment this year.     under this proposal, it sought to defer interest payments until june at the earliest, foreign bankers and government officials here said.     ecuadorean officials held their last formal meeting with the advisory committee in new york in january, but the negotiations were suspended on january 16 due to the 12-hour kidnapping of president leon febres cordero by air force paratroopers.     the red cross says that least 300 people died and at least 4,000 are missing due to the earthquake.  reuter &#3;</h3>
