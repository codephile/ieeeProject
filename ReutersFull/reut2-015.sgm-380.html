	<h3>the value of turnover on the australian stock exchange (asx) soared to a record 17.11 billion dlrs in the first three months of 1987 from 7.50 billion in the corresponding months of 1986, the asx said.     its statement did not give the previous peak.     first quarter volume also rose sharply, to 9.95 billion shares from 4.31 billion a year earlier, it said.     the record volume reflected increased investment in australian companies by local and overseas institutions and the popularity of gold mining and other resource sector shares, the asx said.     in the nine months ended march 31, turnover value climbed to 38.52 billion dlrs from 20.72 billion a year earlier, the asx said.     volume in the nine month period rose to 24.07 billion shares against 13.15 billion a year earlier, it added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
