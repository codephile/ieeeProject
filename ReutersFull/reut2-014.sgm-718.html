	<h3>energy secretary john herrington told congress that a federally chartered corporation would be the best way to manage and operate the government's uranium enrichment program.     he said in a letter to congressmen that unless the program, now run by the energy department, is improved, sales worth five billion dlrs could be lost between 1990 and 2000.     the program now has annual commercial sales of about one billion dlrs and holds 50 pct of the free world market for enrichment services.     a department official said the world market for enriched uranium for reactors for power utilities is increasingly competitive and private entity could better tap it.     the administration's plan to spin off the department's  uranium enrichment operation is in line with it effort to reduce the federal government's role in areas where it feels private enterprise could be more efficient.  reuter &#3;</h3>
