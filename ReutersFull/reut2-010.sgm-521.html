	<h3>cyprus has protested to the united nations over alleged airspace violations by the turkish air force, an official statement said.     "on behalf of my government i wish to protest strongly the above aggression and provocative actions of turkey ..." cyprus' permanent representative at u.n. headquarters said in a letter to u.n. secretary-general javier perez de cuellar.     the protest came as nato ambassadors met in emergency session in brussels to discuss rising tensions between greece and turkey over a disputed area of the aegean sea.     the protest said turkish jets flew over cyprus yesterday during an exercise of turkish forces occupying north cyprus.     there was no immediate indication whether the alleged overflight was connected with the aegean crisis.  reuter &#3;</h3>
