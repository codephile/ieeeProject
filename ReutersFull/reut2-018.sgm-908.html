	<h3>senate banking committee chairman william proxmire, d-wis, said no date had been set for alan greenspan's confirmation hearing as federal reserve chairman because the white house had not formally sent his nomination to the senate.     proxmire said in an interview that as soon as the white house completed its clearence procedures and sent greenspan's name to the senate, he would schedule a hearing on the replacement for paul volcker. the committee and the full senate must confirm greenspan.     volcker's term expires in august.  reuter &#3;</h3>
