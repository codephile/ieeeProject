	<h3>wholly-owned mobil corp <mob> unit, <mobil oil australia ltd>, reported a 38.63 mln dlr net loss in 1986, a turnaround from its 37.25 mln profit in 1985.     the loss reflected a combination of strikes plus scheduled and unscheduled refinery shutdowns for maintenance and inventory losses caused by government controls on both crude and product prices, mobil said in a statement.     however, equity-accounting of associates' profits reduced the loss to 24 mln dlrs against a 37 mln profit in 1985.     mobil said it was confident 1987 would see a return to profit as it built further on its 1985 company restructuring.  reuter &#3;</h3>
