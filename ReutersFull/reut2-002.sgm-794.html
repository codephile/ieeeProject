	<h3>the navy last month grounded half of its a-6e attack jets for wing inspections after a california accident but has since returned half of the grounded planes to service, a navy spokesman said.     kevin mukri said 186 of the navy's 340 a-6e aircraft, built by grumman corp, were grounded on feb. 20 after a jan. 14 a-6e crash during a training flight near el centro, calif., which killed one of two crewmen aboard.     "a subsequent inspection of the wreckage at the naval research laboratory in washington showed an apparent inner wing stress problem," mukri told reuters.     "ninety-seven of the grounded planes have since undergone visual inspections and 91 of those have been cleared to return to service," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
