	<h3>canada's gross domestic product rose 0.1 pct, seasonally adjusted, in january after gaining 1.0 pct in december but falling 0.1 pct and 0.3 pct in november and october, statistics canada said.     january's rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5 pct gain in the goods producing sector. output in services-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from december's level.     january's level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month a year ago.     the federal agency said it was the second straight gain for goods producing industries. most of the growth occurred in manufacturing and construction.     within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood, machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups. significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles and parts, however.     in the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and communication were more than offset by declines in transportation, storage and the retail trade.  reuter &#3;</h3>
