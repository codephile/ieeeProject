	<h3>producers and consumers representing most of world trade in natural rubber adopted a new international natural rubber agreement (inra) aimed at stabilizing world prices over the next five years.     negotiations for a new inra, to succeed the present one which runs out next october, began nearly two years ago.     agreement on the new five-year pact, which uses a buffer stock to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as rates rise or fall, was reached at a two-week session here under the auspices of the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad).  reuter &#3;</h3>
