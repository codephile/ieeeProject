	<h3>southam inc said a canadian government official asked the ontario supreme court to order southam to seek shareholder approval of a 1985 share swap between southam and fellow newspaper publisher torstar corp <tsb.to>.     frederick sparling, an official in the department of consumer and corporate affairs, wants the share exchange nullified if shareholder approval is not obtained, southam added.     southam said it believed it had acted properly and would vigorously defend itself in what would probably be a lengthy process.     sparling's action came after a year-long investigation by the federal corporations branch in response to minority shareholders' complaints about the share exchange, which gave torstar a 22 pct stake in southam.     southam said at the time of the torstar deal that the share swap was necessary to avert a hostile takeover bid for southam by a third party.     the company declined further comment while the case is before the courts.  reuter &#3;</h3>
