	<h3>after battling president reagan all year, congress is about to pass a trillion dollar 1988 budget that sets the stage for even fiercer fighting over its tax and defence policies.     but when the dust settles, congressional budget analysts say, reagan and the democratic opposition may finally sit down at a "budget summit" to call a truce and work out a deal over implementing the budget he opposes.     "i think he essentially will (negotiate)," said a prominent house leader who did not want to be identified. "the ball is in his court ... we've done everything we could to make a summit." the democrat budget plan calls for $19 billion in new taxes next year, $64 billion over three years, and is set to be passed by the democratic-led congress next week. it would cut next year's deficit by about $37 billion to $134 billion.     on tuesday last week, reagan said he would consider talks, except on defence or taxes, but three days later argued that congress would first have to bend even further.  reuter &#3;</h3>
