	<h3>poland's talks in washington with the world bank and the international monetary fund (imf) on the country's 33.5 billion dlr foreign debt were concrete, open and frank, a senior polish banker was quoted as saying.     wladyslaw baka, head of poland's national bank, told the official news agency pap yesterday the talks were a step towards possible fresh credits or easier terms.     "much attention was given to the polish delegation and the talks at both institutions involved displayed a lot of understanding for poland's difficult economic position," pap quoted baka as saying.     baka said he stressed poland would meet its financial obligations to the u.s., "but not in a short time, and not without major changes in the polish economy as well as a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners."     since poland rejoined the imf last june, after a 36-year absence, imf and world bank teams have visited warsaw on fact-finding missions on at least three occasions. a major report is expected to be issued in washington soon.     poland has said it will not be able to meet interest repayments and debt principle falling due this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
