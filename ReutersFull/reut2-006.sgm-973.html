	<h3>swissair <swsz.z> said it was confirming six orders for the new md-11 long-haul jet of mcdonnell douglas corp <md> and had taken options for a further 12 planes.     the order, which involved rejecting the a-340 plane being built by the european airbus consortium, is to replace the airline's fleet of dc-10 aircraft in the early 1990s.     swissair said in december it was giving the md-11 "primary" consideration, and had reserved six places for delivery, pending a final order.  reuter &#3;</h3>
