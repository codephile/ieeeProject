	<h3>the bank of england said it invited an early round of bill offers to help ease tight conditions in the money market.     the bank estimated today's liquidity shortage at about 1.10 billion stg.     bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 1.21 billion stg from the system while a rise in the note circulation and below target bankers' balances would take out 265 mln and 180 mln respectively, the bank said.     against this, exchequer transactions would add a net 535 mln stg.  reuter &#3;</h3>
