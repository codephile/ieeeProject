	<h3>the house agriculture committee voted to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency payments immediately instead of in the late fall.     a similar measure was decisively defeated on the senate floor last week.     the bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow so-called findley payments to be made immediately rather than late this year. payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not be changed.     because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending into fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected to meet stiff resistance in the full house.   reuter &#3;</h3>
