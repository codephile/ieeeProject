	<h3>clabir corp and ambrit corp said they called off their plans for clabir to buy the 16 pct voting interest in ambrit that it does not already own.     the companies said they agreed not to pursue the merger because several actions recently taken by ambrit would mean substantial delays in completing the deal.     they said they might revive merger plans at a later date or seek other ways for clabir to increase its holdings in ambrit.  reuter &#3;</h3>
