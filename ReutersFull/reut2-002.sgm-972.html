	<h3>the suspension of ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior energy ministry official said.     the official said ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at lago agrio to balao on the pacific coast. it would take about 100 mln u.s. dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told reuters. ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.     the earthquake last thursday night registered six on the 12-point international mercalli scale. the damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     financially pressed ecuador, a member of the organisation of petroleum exporting countries (opec), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another energy ministry spokesman said. last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.     however, ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a colombian pipeline, the first official said. he estimated it could take about 60 days to build.     ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of january, about equal to one month's imports.     it suspended interest payments in january on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. the country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in latin america.     in caracas, president jaime lusinchi said venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.     ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to venezuela in repayment in may, lusinchi said.     a commission headed by venezuelan investment fund minister hector hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company petroleos de venezuela will travel to ecuador tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
