	<h3>consolidated rail corp said it and csx corp's csx transportation corp subsidiary have reduced rates on boxcar shipments of manufactured products moving between csx points in the south and conrail points in the northeast and midwest.     conrail said the prices, which were effective march one, are expected to meet or beat comparable truck transportation prices in virtually all target markets.     it said the reduced prices also represent a simplification of the prvious tariff-based rate structure, which used price and milage scales to determine rates. the new prices are constructed from a single table of origin and destination zip codes.  reuter &#3;</h3>
