	<h3>the securities and exchange commission said it charged a managing director of <merrill lynch, pierce, fenner and smith ltd> in london with masterminding "a massive insider trading scheme."     nahum vaskevitch, the managing director of the mergers and aquisitions department of the broker's london office, was charged in a civil complaint by the sec filed in manhattan federal court. the complaint said vaskevitch leaked information about 12 companies that were involved in a merger or aquisition which resulted in more than four mln dlrs in profit for himself and others involved in the scheme.     besides vaskevitch, who is a british and israeli citizen who lives in london, others named as defendants in the suit were david sofer, an israeli citizen living in jerusalem, and two corporations, <plenmeer ltd>, a british company, and <meda establishment>, a lichtenstein corporation.     the scheme, which covered a two year period, allegedly involved vaskevitch leaking information to sofar about looming takeovers and mergers, some of which he worked on, according to the complaint. the sec secured a temporary restraining order freezing all the assets of the defendants in the united states. a hearing is set for march 20.     merrill lynch, pierce, fenner and smith is a subsidiary of merrill lynch and co inc <mer>.     according to the court documents, sofer is a principal in both plenmeer and meda establishment and vaskevitch has an interest in plenmeer.     the suit was filed in new york because trading allegedly took place here.      one of the deals in which an insider profit was alleged was the 1984 merger of k-mart corp <km> with <pay less drug stores>.     another deal was the sale by w.r. grace and co <gra> of its holdings in <hermann's sporting goods co>.     an sec official in washington said the vaskevitch case is unrelated to the agency's widening investigation into wall street's insider trading scandal involving ivan boesky and dennis levine.     neither vaskevitch nor sofar are currently living in the united states and cannot be extradited on the basis of the sec's civil charges filed against them, the official said.     vaskevitch is living in england and sofar's whereabouts are unknown, he said.     "we can't force them to come back," the official said.     the agency is moving to seize all u.s. assets of both men, which they could forfeit if they do not contest the case, the sec official said.     although the sec recently signed an accord with britain aimed at improving cooperation between the two countries in investigating securities law violations, the sec official said it did not need to rely on u.k. authorities in this case.     "we were able to make our case against them here," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
