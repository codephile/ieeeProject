	<h3>the federal reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to add temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 to 2.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, economists said.     they said that while the fed has only a moderate add need over the next few days, it will probably intervene in an attempt to counteract an elevated federal funds rate.     fed funds, which averaged 6.09 pct on friday, opened at 6-3/16 pct and remained at that level in early trading.  reuter &#3;</h3>
