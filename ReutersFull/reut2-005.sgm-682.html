	<h3>the senate budget committee sits down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel taxes and other tax options to cut the budget.     in a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy consumption based on five pct of value.     other proposals include various excise taxes and combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10 pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise 22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.     the committee, however, will only include revenue numbers in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left to the house and senate tax-writing committees.      the committee will draft a budget which its chairman, sen lawton chiles, a florida democrat, said he hopes would raise at least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36 billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.     the house budget committee also plans to start drafting a separate budget plan later this week, which would have to be reconciled with the senate version. the final budget would be the fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint.   reuter &#3;</h3>
