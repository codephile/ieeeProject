	<h3>sri lanka's cabinet has ordered a 12 pct cut in budget spending by ministries this year to offset the rising cost of the fight against tamil guerrillas, finance ministry officials said.     a senior economist at the ministry, who declined to be named, told reuters the cuts would not apply to defence-related ministries and those involved in health and education.     defence expenditure, projected at 10 billion rupees this year, is now forecast at 12 billion and is expected to exceed this by the year-end.     the economist said the cuts were part of a government plan to reduce spending to satisfy the international monetary fund (imf) which has promised to lend sri lanka 6.5 billion rupees to help its balance of payments.     the imf has said previously sri lanaka must reduce its budget and balance of payments deficits to satisfy loan conditions.     he said world bank and imf teams were expected here next month. "if approved the loan would be available only after november and would be part of the 1988 budget," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
