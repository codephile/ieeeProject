	<h3>italy's majority christian democrats have handed in their resignation from the five-party government in which they are senior partners, deputy prime minister arnaldo forlani said.     forlani, president of the party, said he had handed a letter of resignation by the christian democrats, who make up more than half the 30 member cabinet, to the office of prime minister bettino craxi.     political sources said the withdrawal of the christian democrats meant the coalition -- which also includes republicans, social democrats and liberals as well as the socialists -- had collapsed.  reuter &#3;</h3>
