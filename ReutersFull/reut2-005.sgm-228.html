	<h3>nec corp <nesi.t> may take legal action to halt introduction of <seiko epson corp>'s nec-compatible personal computer series, which nec alleges infringes copyrights for nec's 9801 v computer series, an nec official said.     "we may have no choice but to take legal action," the nec official said.     a seiko epson official said the company's pc 286 series, the first nec-compatible personal computer, does not infringe on nec copyrights. he said the company intends to go ahead with plans to market the computers from late april.     a seiko epson official said of the new machine, "it's compatible with nec's machine, so it appears similar. but our intention was to develop an original machine."     industry analysts said nec controls about 70 pct of the domestic personal computer market.     they said introduction of nec-compatible machines could start a price war and cut nec's profits, as happened to ibm following the introduction of ibm-compatible machines.  reuter &#3;</h3>
