	<h3>vertex industries inc and <computer transceiver systems inc> jointly announced an agreement for vertex to acquire a 60 pct interest in computer after it completes a proposed reorganization.     computer has been in reorganization proceedings under chapter 11 since september 1986.     the companies said the agreement would allow computer's unsecured creditors and debenture holders to receive new stock in exchange for exsiting debt, and for shareholders to receive one new share of computer's stock for each four shares previously held.         the companies said the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york has given preliminary approval for the proposal, which is subject to formal approval by computer's creditors and the court.     under the agreement, vertex also said it would supply computer with 250,000 dlrs of operating funds, and arrange renegotiation of its secured bank debt, among other things.  reuter &#3;</h3>
