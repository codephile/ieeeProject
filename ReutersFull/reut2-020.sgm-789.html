	<h3>cip inc, wholly-owned by canadian pacific ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in texas which would use kenaf fibre instead of wood, cip president cecil slenniken said in an interview.      the kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and was artificially developed several years ago. the plant, which has been grown in southern texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint than wood pulp, a cip official said.      slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a 200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but would need partners to begin the project.     "we are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of dollars it would take for such a project," slenniken said.      he said cip has been using the pulp on a trial basis to make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct softwood fibre at its trois-rivieres, quebec plant.     cip, canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently launched a 366 mln canadian dlr newsprint mill at gold river, british columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metric tonnes per year by fall of 1989.  reuter &#3;</h3>
