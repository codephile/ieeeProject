	<h3>france's state-run television channel tf-1, which is in the process of being privatised, should achieve a profit of around 25 francs per share next year after several years of losses, but will not make a profit this year, the new tf-1 president francis bouygues said.     interviewed on tf-1 on the eve of the public flotation of 40 pct of the channel's equity, bouygues said "in 1988 we have to make a profit, and we will make a profit."     "i envisage per share profits of 25 francs," he said. "i am very optimistic."      bouygues said exceptional costs associated with the restructuring of the station would prevent a profit this year.     the state sold a 50 pct stake in tf-1 in april to a consortium led by bouygues, a construction magnate, and including british press baron robert maxwell.     tomorrow 40 pct of the shares go on sale to the public at 165 francs each, while 10 pct will be offered at a special price of 132 francs a share to the station's staff.     bouygues said a dividend would be paid to shareholders next year if the station did return to profit.      asked if he thought the flotation price was right, bouygues said, "i paid virtually double...i consider that it is a good buy."     the bouygues consortium paid three billion francs for its 50 pct controlling stake in april.     after the two-week public flotation, tf-1 shares will start trading on the second market here in late july.   reuter &#3;</h3>
