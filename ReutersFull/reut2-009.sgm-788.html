	<h3>the italian treasury said it would offer an undetermined amount of 10-year variable-coupon certificates (ccts) at a rate unchanged on that of the preceding offer in late february.     the treasury said that, unlike the previous offer, the amount had not been prefixed. it would be in line with market demand unless this was considered excessive.     the ccts will be priced at 99.00 pct for an effective net annual yield on the first coupon, payable april 1, 1988, of 9.85 pct.     subsequent yields on the certificates will be calculated by adding 0.75 point to average rates on short-term treasury bills.     subscriptions to the issue open april 1 and are scheduled to close april 7.     the treasury said it reserved the right to close the issue early.  reuter &#3;</h3>
