	<h3>the world bank is prepared to play a more aggressive role in promoting third world development, bank president barber conable said in a magazine interview.     "our plans include initiatives on the debt front, as well as greater emphasis on debt-equity swaps and the promotion of private investment in third world countries through our affiliate, the international financial corporation," conable told newsweek international.     conable, who has just completed his first year as head of the world bank, said the bank's mission remains the development of third world nations.     "the bank is primarily a development institution, not a debt-management agency. but debt must be managed effectively or it hampers development," he told newsweek.     conable said the bank must step in to help relieve the debt crisis, which has prompted a number of u.s. commercial banks to write off a portion of their third world loans.     conable defended his own reorganization plan for the world bank, which he said was aimed at improving efficiency and limiting a growing bureaucracy.     and he said environmental considerations will play a larger role in the evaluation of proposed projects.  reuter &#3;</h3>
