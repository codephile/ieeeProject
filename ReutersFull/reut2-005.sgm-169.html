	<h3>saudi arabia's ministry of finance and national economy has started to issue an index to measure share activity in the kingdom.     an official of the ministry's national centre for financial and economic information said the weekly index, based on the u.s. standard and poors index, had been kept for over two years but was only now being published.     measuring the prices of 48 companies currently traded in saudi arabia, the index reached 68.72 points in the week ended last march 5, down from the previous week's 69.50.     it is divided into four subcategories -- agriculture which stood at 99.03 points on march 5, industry at 54.44, services at 76.93 and finance at 61.46.     the ministry begun issuing the index at a time when the situation is improving in the saudi stock market after a two-year decline.  reuter &#3;</h3>
