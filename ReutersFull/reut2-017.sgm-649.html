	<h3>about 300 local representatives on the united automobile workers union's general motors corp bargaining council convened at a detroit hotel this morning for private strategy sessions in the run-up to this summer's national contract bargaining covering 380,000 uaw members at gm.     although the sessions were closed to the press, uaw vice-president donald ephlin urged delegates in a bargaining document obtained by reuters to be "willing to use creative and non-traditional means in achieving our bargaining goals."     the document calls outsourcing of gm's production work to foreign or non-gm operations "perhaps the greatest single threat to the job security of our members" and urges bargainers to seek an expansion of limits on the giant automaker's ability to outsource.     while saying that outsourcing pits "worker against worker" and the uaw "will not tolerate this practice," the document falls short of demanding an outright ban on the practice and instead calls for improvements in "current provisions and restrictions on outsourcing."     the union said its barginers must seek bans against plant and work place closings "similar to those included in our 1982 and 1984 contracts."     in addition, the uaw said, "full resumption of our traditional wage formula is a top priority in this set of negotiations."     while the document does not specify a percentage wage increase, the uaw's traditional standard before making concessions in 1982 was a three pct annual wage increase with benefits calculated from the base wage rate.  reuter &#3;</h3>
