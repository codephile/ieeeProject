	<h3>it could be months before major assistance is provided for earthquake-stricken ecuador, although the international monetary fund and the development banks have already taken the first steps, monetary sources and u.s. officials said.     they said the imf had informed the ecuadorean government that it was prepared, under its emergency system, to provide about 50 mln dlrs, or about 25 per cent of the country's quota in the agency, but it is up to ecuador to request the money.     at the same time, the world bank and the inter-american development bank have dispatched missions to the region hit by last thursday's quake to determine what the country's needs are and how they can speed up disbursement of funds from programs already approved.     the world bank estimates that of the over one billion dlrs it has approved for ecuador in recent years, some 277 mln dlrs has yet to be disbursed and a portion of this could, potentially, be made available.     the bank said that the programs it has approved are for rural development, agriculture, water and sewerage, electrical power and others.     if the assistance that is needed can be fit into these general categories, the funds could be then provided for from expedited disbursements  reuter &#3;</h3>
