	<h3>the federal reserve is expected to enter the u.s. government securities market to add temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 billion dlrs or more of customer repurchase agreements, economists said.     they said the below-six pct federal funds rate suggests the fed does not have a large reserve adding need. however, some dealers reportedly backed out of the three-day system repurchase agreements set on monday, leaving the fed with a somewhat increased need to supply reserves.     federal funds, which averaged 6.05 pct yesterday, opened at 5-15/16 pct and remained there in early trading.  reuter &#3;</h3>
