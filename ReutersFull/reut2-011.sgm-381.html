	<h3>the federal reserve is expected to enter the u.s. government securities market to add temporary reserves, economists said.     they said the fed probably will add the reserves indirectly by arranging around two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements. a direct reserve supply through system repurchase agreements is possible instead.     federal funds, which averaged 6.33 pct yesterday, opened at 6-3/4 pct and traded between there and 6-3/8 pct. end of quarter demand pressures are pushing up the funds rate.  reuter &#3;</h3>
