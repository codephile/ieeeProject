	<h3>treasury secretary james baker said that over the long-term the tax reform bill and lower marginal tax rates should increase compliance with the tax law and bring in additional revenue.     in testimony before a senate appropriations subcommittee baker said no savings in the treasury's budgetary requirements wil be achieved in the short-run by the new tax law.     "the tax changes occurring in 1987 and 1988 under tax reform will not directly effect irs enforcement activities until financial year 1989 and 1990."     he told the subcommittee that the treasury's objective was to strengthen the capability of the internal revenue service to promote tax compliance and generate revenue.     he said they were seeking funds to increase staffing to reduce the backlog of delinquent tax accounts, reducing pending tax litigation cases under appeal, and resolving unreported income cases disclosed through a program that matches third party documents to returns.     "this request will continue our effort to build a stronger and more credible deterrent against non-compliance with tax laws," he said.     baker also told the subcommittee that the administration would continue the efforts to improve the management of the government's cash and credit, and its financial information.      in addition a policy of full reimbursement to federal reserve banks for the fiscal agent services they provide in marketing and maintaining treasury securities will be continued.  reuter &#3;</h3>
