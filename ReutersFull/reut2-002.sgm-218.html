"mr. landes has requested the company to implement a program to maximize shareholder values, which might include a sale of all or part of the company or a liquidation," he said in a filing with the securities and exchange commission.     landes and another unitel video investor, albert schwatz, have formed a shareholder group and together hold 329,225 common shares, or 15.2 pct of the total outstanding common stock.     landes and schwartz had reached an agreement in principle with the new york video tape service company on a 12.50 dlr a share takeover proposal last september, but subsequent merger talks broke down in october.     the investors told the sec they are continuing to review their positions company and may acquire more shares or sell some or all of their current stake.  reuter &#3;</h3>
