	<h3>the united steelworkers of america said that bankruptcy judge burton liflands's refusal to act on a union lawsuit was "a gross denial of due process for 47,000 retired employees of ltv steel."     the union is seeking an injunction that would require ltv corp <qltv> to reinstate 400 dlr monthly supplements to about 7,000 retirees. the union said that the judge, at the request of the <pension benefit guaranty corp>, delayed proceedings until may four. it said the case was originally to have been heard on february 27.     the union said ltv stopped making monthly payments in february after pension went before lifland and received permission to terminate ltv pension plans covering 47,000 retired hourly workers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
