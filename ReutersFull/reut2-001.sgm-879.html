	<h3>the sharp fall in international coffee prices will not affect colombia's external credit situation, finance minister cesar gaviria told reuters.     "our foreign debt is high, but we can pay, and i hope the foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us," he said.     he said the current decline on world coffee markets was not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on colombia's financial state, which he described as sound.     gaviria said the decline in coffee prices could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987.     the conservative party and the country's largest trade union called this week for the debt to be rescheduled following the price drop.     colombia, the only major latin american country not to have rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt of 13.6 billion dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
