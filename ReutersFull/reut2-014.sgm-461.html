	<h3>the chase manhattan bank, n.a. <cmb>, is closing its peruvian consumer banking operations less than three yeas after they opened, the bank's manager in peru, jorge sosa, said.     he told reuters june 30 was the closing date. he said the measure was not linked to peru's foreign debt position. chase is one of peru's top private banking creditors.     peru is over 700 mln dlrs in arrears on its interest owed to its 280 or so private foreign bank creditors, bankers said.     sosa said chase opened its local consumer banking operation in september 1984. it held the equivalent of around four mln dlrs in deposits and had extended the equivalent of about five mln dlr in loans.     the bank still had to decide whether it would sell the holdings to another banking institution before closing the operation, he said.     the closing of chase's consumer operation will leave only five foreign banks operating this service in peru. two of them are institutions from the united states and there is one each from britain, japan and spain.  reuter &#3;</h3>
