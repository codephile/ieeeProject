	<h3>deputy assistant treasury secretary james conrow said he was exceedingly pessimistic that 1988 funding for the multilateral development banks, as proposed by the reagan administration, will be approved by congress.     speaking to an international development conference, conrow said it appears almost certain congress will opt to cut spending for international programs before they cut into domestic programs.     he said in such an environment "foreign aid will lose and lose big."     the administration has proposed development bank funding of 1.8 billion dlrs for fiscal year 1988 and seeks about 290 mln dlrs in catch-up from funding reduced in prior years.     reuter &#3;</h3>
