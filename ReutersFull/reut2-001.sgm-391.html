	<h3>commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said he felt a proposed takeover by japan's <fujitsu ltd> of u.s.-based fairchild semiconductor corp, a subsidiary of schlumberger ltd <slb>, should be carefully reviewed.     he told the semiconductor industry association the deal would soon be discussed by representatives of several different government departments.     the reagan administration has previously expressed concern that the proposed takeover would make fujitsu a powerful part of the u.s. market for so-called supercomputers at a time when japan has not bought any american-made supercomputers.     in addition, u.s. defense officials have said they were worried semiconductor technology could be transferred out of the united states, eventually giving japanese-made products an edge in american high-technology markets for defense and other goods.     treasury secretary james baker recently told a senate committee the proposed takeover would be reviewed by the  cabinet-level economic policy council.  reuter &#3;</h3>
