	<h3>diversified building materials group monier ltd <mnra.s> said talks are taking place which may lead to britain's redland plc <rdld.l> making an offer for the monier shares it does not already hold, chairman bill locke said.     redland already holds about 49 pct of monier's 156.28 mln issued shares, he said in a brief notice to the australian stock exchange.     locke said shareholders would be advised as soon as the discussions progressed and recommended that they keep their shares.     monier shares were trading at a 1987 high of 3.10 dlrs today, up from the previous peak of 2.80 at yesterday's close, and well above the 1987 low of 2.18 dlrs.     monier is the largest concrete roof tile manufacturer in australia, the u.s. and new zealand and the world's largest marketer of fly ash, according to its annual report for 1985/86 ended june 30.     it recently reported first-half 1986/87 net fell to 15.02 mln dlrs from 17.09 mln a year earlier due to the australian housing downturn, although foreign earnings rose.  reuter &#3;</h3>
