	<h3>the european commission has not taken a decision on applications from the british government for the release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the british market in may and june, commission sources said.     they said last week's cereals management committee agreed to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between april 14 and may 26. it also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from april 23.     however, it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later.     the british government had applied for the release of a further 100,000 tonnes in both may and june from british intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.     however, the sources said, the commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval.     the commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the sources noted.     following last week's committee meeting, the u.k. ministry of agriculture said the commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in may and june. it also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes, depending on the state of the market.     this lead to the widespread assumption that the commission had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the three months of april, may and june at last week's meeting.  reuter &#3;</h3>
