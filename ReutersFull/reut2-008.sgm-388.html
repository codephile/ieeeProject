	<h3>house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski (d-ill.) said congress would more readily respond to the needs of the u.s. futures industry to be internationally competitive if the industry showed a willingness to do its business honestly.     rostenkowski told the futures industry association that if other countries were relaxing futures regulations "because ours are being tightened, so that they can take a competitive advantage, i think we (congress) have a responsibility to keep you out in front."     but he told the futures leaders that they "have a more important reponsibility to do your business honestly. you can't ignore the trader who is improperly using his opportunity."  reuter &#3;</h3>
