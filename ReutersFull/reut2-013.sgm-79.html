	<h3>u.s. scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to a campaign by the american soybean association (asa) for labelling changes.     the scientists appeared to support an asa charge, denied by malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.     in a petition filed in january, the asa asked the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) to require palm, palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers' labels.     the fda responded to the asa in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods.     malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the asa that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue.     but steve chang, professor of food science at rutgers university, said, "palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid."     he added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the blood cholesterol level. "it has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease," he said.     a malaysian oil palm growers council official, borge bek-nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans.     bek-nielsen said americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins a and e.     david kritchevsky, associate director of the wistar institute in philadelphia, appeared to take the asa view on labelling. "what people really have to learn is to read labels," said kritchevsky. "the more a consumer knows, the more likely he will make an intelligent choice."     the u.s. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm, palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels.     kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, "more saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...so, from that point of view it's a health risk. high cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease."     susanne harris, deputy assistant secretary of the u.s. agriculture department's food and consumer services division, said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease.     the scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.     david ericksen, director of asa's technical services, said u.s. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.     imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of u.s. soybean sales in the u.s. market, asa estimates.     u.s. imports of coconut oil during january totaled 82.9 mln lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in december and 106.5 mln a year earlier, according to commerce department figures.     imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3 mln lbs in december and 85.2 mln a year earlier.  reuter &#3;</h3>
