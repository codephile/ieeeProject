	<h3>the federal reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to add temporary reserves via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.     most economists said the fed will add 1.5 to two billion dlrs of temporary reserves via customer repurchase agreements, but some said there is a slim chance the fed will inject permanent reserves via three-day system repurchase agreements.     federal funds opened at 6-1/16 pct and firmed to 6-1/8 pct in early trading. funds averaged six pct on friday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
