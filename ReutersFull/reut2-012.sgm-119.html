	<h3>treasury secretary james baker said the administration backs the federal savings and loan insurance corp (fslic) recapitalization bill approved by the house banking committee and opposes the senate-passed version.     baker told a house appropriations subcommittee the 15 billion dlr recapitalization plan approved by the house panel was sufficient while the 7.5 billion dlr plan in the senate-passed bill was "inadequate."     he also urged the house to reject loophole-closing provisions in the senate bill that would restrict banking activities.  reuter &#3;</h3>
