	<h3>coopervision inc said it is preparing a recapitalization plan, which includes a common stock repurchase program and an exchange of debt securities for common stock.     the plan, along with a proposal to change its name to cooper cos inc, will be submitted for shareholders' approval at the company's annual meeting on june 22.     the meeting had been postponed from its original date of may 14 in order to let management review recapitalization options, it said.     in addition, coopervision said operating income in its current fiscal quarter ending april 30 is expected to show an improvement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs and its year ago quarter.     income from continuing operations was not immediately availalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which it reported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs.     at a drexel burnham lambert investor conference, coopervision chairman parker montgomery said, as previously announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for shareholders.     he also said coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35 dlrs a share, and ivan boesky's subsequent sale of his position.     "the stock dropped six dlrs in three days after boesky sold his position and has never recovered," montgomery said. the company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.     montgomery further told the conference, "don't be an investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery in operating or net income in 1987 and 1988."     "our concentration is on maintaining or increasing market share in our core businesses this year and next, regardless of the impact to the bottom line," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
