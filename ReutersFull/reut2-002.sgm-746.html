	<h3>the reagan administration continues to debate whether to offer subsidized wheat to the soviet union, but would need assurances from the soviets that they would buy the wheat before the subsidy offer would be made, a senior u.s. agriculture department official said.     "i think it still is under active debate whether or not it would be advisable" to make an the export enhancement offer to the soviets, thomas kay, administrator of the department's foreign agriculture service, told reuters.     "we'd need some assurances from them (the soviets) that they would buy if offered" the wheat under the subsidy plan, he said. kay called reports that such an offer was imminent "premature."     the reagan administration's cabinet-level economic policy council is set to meet today to discuss, among other matters, agricultural policy but is not expected to address a wheat subsidy offer to the soviet union, administration officials said earlier.  reuter &#3;</h3>
