	<h3>brazil and its bank creditors failed to achieve any breakthrough in debt talks here last night after brazil refused to say when it would resume interest payments.     central bank governor francisco gros said after a meeting with a 14-bank advisory committee that brazil cannot make any interest payments at this time, though it would do so "as soon as we can."     the talks came as the annual meeting of the 44-nation inter-american development bank (iadb), in which both gros and the bankers had been taking part, moved toward a close here.     bankers leaving the meeting with gros declined to discuss details of the talks, though some expressed satisfaction that brazil had agreed to continue working with the committee.     at the same time, gros told reporters not to expect any dramatic developments before march 31, the date when some u.s. banks have said they will take a decision whether to put brazil loans on a non-performing basis.     brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr foreign debt to commercial banks on february 20 and shortly after announced it was freezing some 16 billion dlrs in short-term credit lines.     banks are not obliged to declare these loans non-performing before 90 days have elapsed, but the move to announce a possible decision in this respect was viewed as a means of exerting pressure on brazil.     the bank committee, headed by citibank, had been pressing brazil to make at least a token payment of interest but gros said this was not possible right now.     "we are not in a position to make a payment at this stage," gros said.     at the same time, the two sides reached a stopgap arrangement on the short-term trade and money-market credit lines, whereby the committee agreed to transmit a brazilian request to extend the lines for 60 days until may 31.     banks have been indicating they will not renew credit lines in response to the brazilian move.  reuter &#3;</h3>
