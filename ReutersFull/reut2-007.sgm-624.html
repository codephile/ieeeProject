	<h3>the west german government expressed support for the u.s. position in opposing the proposed european community tax on vegetable oils and fats, a u.s. embassy spokesman said.     the spokesman, speaking from bonn, said, "we have good reason to think west germany holds to its resistance to the proposed tax."     several top government officials told the american soybean association and the national soybean processors association delegations there was no reason for american producers and processors to pay for ec agriculture, the spokesman said.     european agriculture was facing severe problems, but both the community and the u.s. should work closely within the framework provided by the general agreement on tariffs and trade, he said.     the delegations will continue their top level meetings in bonn today but will not issue a statement before returning to the u.s. at the weekend.     the ec and the u.s. realised the tax issue would stay on the agenda for several months and there were indications that both sides would have to prepare for some tough negotiations, the spokesman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
