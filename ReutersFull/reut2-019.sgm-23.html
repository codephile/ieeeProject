	<h3>prime minister rajiv gandhi's congress (i) party was swept from power in the northern state of haryana by an opposition landslide.     the loss was a major personal setback for gandhi whose vote-winning ability was on trial after political scandals in delhi and a string of electoral losses since he took command of the party in 1984.     with 53 results in for haryana's 90-seat assembly, congress had won only two seats against 63 previously. before the poll, congress politicians in delhi said privately that a loss in haryana could open a party leadership debate.  reuter &#3;</h3>
