	<h3>the first convertible bond issued by a south korean firm overseas -- by samsung electronics co ltd <sams.se> -- became eligible for conversion but there was no demand for shares as the government still bans direct share ownership by foreigners, a samsung official said.     "there was no demand from holders, so the lead managers made no approach to us to issue shares," the official said.     the five pct bond, co-lead managed by s.g. warburg and goldman sachs co, raised 20 mln dlrs when issued in 1985. the only other korean convertible bonds were issued by daewoo heavy industries ltd <daew.se> and <yukong ltd>, both in 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
