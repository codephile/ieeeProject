	<h3>u.s. house speaker jim wright said he was concerned that the appointment of alan greenspan to succeed paul volcker at the federal reserve board would mean interest rates would rise.     speaking to reporters, the texas democrat said that based of greenspan's tenure as chairman of president nixon's council of economic advisers his policies would mean higher rates.     "his previous service indicates the kind of economic policies based on the trickle down theory rather than the percolate up theory. this theory tends to higher interest rates," wright said.     wright told reporters he would not have chosen greenspan to head the fed, but he declined to name his preference. "it would be someone whose primary interest is in keeping interest rates low. that is the national interest," he said.     his main concern was that high interest rates have slowed economic growth and held down the number of new jobs. the united states needs "to reduce the level of interest rates so this economy can get oxygen and breathe," wright said.     wright said he had not talked with greenspan about the appointment.     asked to rate volcker's tenure, he replied, "long."  reuter &#3;</h3>
