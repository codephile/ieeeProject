	<h3>world bank president barber conable said he was concerned about the state of brazil's economy and urged the country to come up with a plan soon to put its economic house in order.     "i am very concerned about the brazilian economy," he told reporters after a news conference in tokyo.     he said brazil had caught the attention of the world with its decision last month to stop paying interest on its loans from commercial banks but warned it not to sqaunder the time it gained by failing to come up with a new economic program.     brazil's decision jolted the world's financial community as the country is 108 billion dlrs in debt, including some 68 billion owed to commercial banks.     brazilian finance ministry sources said in brasilia yesterday that the country was preparing a new economic strategy designed to ensure domestic economic growth.     despite mounting domestic and overseas pressure, brazil has said repeatedly that it will not go to the international monetary fund (imf) for help in drawing up a new plan for fear that will only throw its economy into recession.     conable said the country may be able to get away with not going to the imf for help, but will need an imf-type economic program if it wants to regain the confidence of lenders.     outsiders like the world bank are reluctant to suggest possible solutions to brazil's economic problems because of the delicate political situation there, he added.     while the world bank has a role to play in helping brazil, it can&#127;ot replace the imf as an overseer of the economy, conable said. he added that the fund can be very flexible in its dealings with developing countries, adjusting its approach to the political realities.     brazil still seems willing to talk to the fund under the annual discussions that all imf members undertake, conable said, adding that this could partially solve the current stalemate.     during his news conference, conable said the world bank backed u.s. treasury secretary james baker's third world debt initiative, which calls for stepped up lending to heavily indebted third world countries adopting economic policies.     "the world bank believes the baker initiative is the best approach," he said. "debt forgiveness is difficult to design in any fair way and also will tend to discourage further investment and development."     he cited the recent multi-billion dollar debt package for mexico, the third world's most indebted country after brazil.     "will it work?" he asked. "we don't know...but we think it more likely to work than any of the alternatives suggested."     conable, who is here to meet government and business leaders, expressed confidence that japan will make increasing use of its huge trade surplus to help developing countries.     "we are quite confident japan will make an increasing investment in development because of their willingness to support institutions like ours in increasing ways with each passing year," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
