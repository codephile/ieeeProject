	<h3>senate majority leader robert byrd urged president reagan to negotiate with the democratic-led congress over budget matters.     he told reporters that reagan and republicans failed to help write the budget expected to get final congressional approval next week.     he said it was time for reagan to move from his "hobby horse" and get into the negotiations over tax and defence matters, the two issues dividing reagan and democrats.     reagan has said he would veto any bill implementing the suggested 19 billion dlrs in 1988 taxes in the budget.  reuter &#3;</h3>
