	<h3>the u.s. senate finance committee approved nonbinding resolutions urging the reagan administration oppose canada's ruling on u.s corn imports and a proposed new european community tax on vegetable oils.     the resolutions, approved by voice vote, now will be sent to the senate floor were they are expected to be approved.     the ec oils measure, offered by sen. john danforth, r-mo., urges the administration to take strong retaliatory measures if the tax is approved by the ec council of ministers.     sen. david durenberger, r-minn., offered the corn amendment which urges the administration to file a complaint with the gatt if the u.s. believes the corn decision by canada was unjustified. canada recently imposed a permanent duty of 85 cents per bushel on u.s. corn imports.  reuter &#3;</h3>
