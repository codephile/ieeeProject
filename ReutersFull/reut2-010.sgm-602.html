	<h3>the main road between landlocked zambia and the tanzanian port of dar es salaam is to be rehabilitated at a cost of 109 mln dlrs, starting in december, willie lyatu, the project coordinator in the tanzanian ministry of communications, said.     the road runs parallel to the chinese-built tazara, (tanzania-zambia) railway and is in bad condition.     lyatu said the government was currently evaluating 52 bids by international contractors to rehabilitate 293.5 km of the asphalt highway and 800 km of other trunk roads with a gravel surface.     the final list of contractors would be issued by the world bank, the project's main sponsor, at the end of april, he added.     the world bank is contributing 50 mln dlrs to the project, which is also being financed by the african development bank, norway and denmark.  reuter &#3;</h3>
