	<h3>sales of u.s.-made cars during mid-march, the traditional start of the spring selling season, dropped 3.9 pct behind last year's level, analysts say.     automakers sold about 204,000 cars in the march 11-20 selling period, 10,000 fewer than last year. analysts said the decline may auger poorly for the rest of the spring season.     buyers shied away from the showrooms of american motors corp <amo>, the target of a 1.5 billion dlr takeover bid from chrysler corp <c>. analysts said consumers were anxious about the whether chrysler will retain some american motors models, causing a 62 pct drop in american motors sales in mid-march.     chrysler's mid-march sales fell 3.6 pct.     "during the spring selling season, you usually look for some kind of seasonal uplift in sales. it doesn't look like it's happening," said joseph philippi, analyst with e.f. hutton and co.     "there may be less bloom to the spring selling season this year than last," one auto company official conceded.     general motors corp <gm>, still working to regain consumer interest in its cars, led the drop with a 14.8 pct decline.     ford motor co's <f> sales increased 15.2 pct for the period. but analysts said the rise compares to a 1986 period for ford, leaving it down 10 pct in two years.     "the total industry (mid-march sales) was slightly less than expected," the company official said.     american motors' decline caught analysts eye. "american motors took it on the chin--big," said philippi.     given the prospective takeover by chrysler, "people might be a little leary about going to (american motors) dealers," he said.     american motors sold 790 domestic cars in the period, meaning each of american motors 1,050 dealers "is selling a car about every other day," philippi said.     potential american motors buyers are afraid their car models "might disappear," he said.     chrysler, in its purchase agreement with american motors' majority stockholder <renault>, has agreed not to undercut sales of american motors' new medallion and premier cars, made by renault.     on a company by company basis, sales of u.s. made cars from the march 11 to 20 period were--gm 105,438, down 14.8 pct, ford 67,672, up 15.2 pct, chrysler 30,909, down 3.6 pct, american motors 790, down 6.2 pct, american honda 7,447 compared with 5,031, nissan motor corp, 3,358, up 10.7 pct, volkswagon u.s. inc 1,330, down 35 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
