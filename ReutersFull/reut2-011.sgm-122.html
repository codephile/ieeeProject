	<h3>canada's major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their brazilian loans non-performing if, as expected, major u.s. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said.     american bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with brazil increased the likelihood that u.s. banks would soon declare their brazilian loans non-performing.     such action "would put a lot of pressure on the canadian banks to do the same," levesque, beaubien inc toronto-based bank analyst donna pulcine told reuters.     "they (banks) like to appear to be conservative," said pulcine, "and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not."     wood gundy inc bank analyst patricia meredith said any willingness by a major brazilian bank creditor such as citicorp <cci> to declare its brazilian loans non-performing rather than let brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks.     "in order to make that strategy work, they (citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks," said meredith.     bank analyst michael walsh at first marathon securities ltd said at least one canadian bank, which he declined to identify, "wants to put (the brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position."     canadian banks are owed about seven billion canadian dlrs by brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion u.s. dlr foreign bank debt.     banks in canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days. they could therefore delay action on the brazilian loans until late may, which falls in canadian banks' third quarter ending july 31.     <bank of montreal>, brazil's largest canadian bank creditor, said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of brazilian loans as non-performing.     "i think that is just for the benefit of the public," walsh said of bank of montreal's statement.      some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on canadian banks from a move to declare the brazilian loans non-performing.     they said brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks' fiscal year-end on october 31, thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income.     "from what brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks will get the money," said meredith. "my outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's earnings."     meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for <royal bank of canada> compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for <bank of montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for <canadian imperial bank of commerce> compared with 2.23;  2.15 dlrs for <bank of nova scotia> compared with 1.94, and 2.85 dlrs for <toronto dominion bank> against 2.74.     she forecast 1.90 dlrs for <national bank of canada> against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.     analyst pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share, assuming a possible settlement reduced brazil's interest costs.     "if the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. but i don't see that as a likely scenario," pulcine said.     walsh at first marathon suggested, however, that the brazilian debt situation was so complex that "it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year."     he said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. he estimated that brazil's yearly interest payments to canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings.  reuter &#3;</h3>
