	<h3>coffee producers belonging to the "other milds" group will meet may 4 in guatemala to discuss the possibility of restoring export quotas, producer delegates told reporters after the closing session of the international coffee organization, ico, executive board meeting.     the "other milds" group, comprising costa rica, dominican republic, ecuador, el salvador, guatemala, honduras, india, mexico, nicaragua, papua new guinea and peru, might consult with brazil and colombia on this meeting, but it was not certain whether these two countries would attend, they said.     the ico board meeting ended without moves to restart negotiations on quotas, which broke down last month, producer delegates said.     producers are expected to hold other consultations in the coming months on how to proceed with quota negotiations, but no date for a full producer meeting has been mentioned, they said.     the board completed reports on stock verification and the next regular board session will be in indonesia june 1-5, delegates said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
