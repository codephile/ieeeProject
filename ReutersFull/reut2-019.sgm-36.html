	<h3>indonesia has increased its share in a 434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with japan from 25 to 37 pct, asahan project authority director a.r. suhud said.     the japanese export-import bank said indonesia had raised its share of (p.t. indonesia asahan aluminium) company, capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen in government loans to the company for an equity stake.     the japanese shareholders, the overseas economic cooperation fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24 billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.     asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between 1982 and 1985. suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation of the yen against the u.s. dollar. aluminium is sold in dollars.     prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to about 1,450 dlrs today. the plant is supposed to break even if prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.     sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a year, would probably lose money again in 1987. the plant, situated in north sumatra, produces mostly for japan.  reuter &#3;</h3>
