	<h3>britain and australia have offered a total of 129,250 tonnes of wheat to bangladesh as grants to contain rising cereal prices and help support rural employment projects, officials said.     they said 79,250 tonnes of wheat promised by britain would be shipped next week and used for the government's "food for work" program in the villages.     under the program, workers building roads, digging irrigation canals and engaged in other rural development activities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money.     the 50,000 tonnes of australian wheat would arrive in bangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operations designed to stop price increases, the officials said.     prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in the past month, market sources said. but the government expects prices to fall after the wheat harvest next month.  reuter &#3;</h3>
