	<h3>federal reserve board vice chairman manuel johnson said inflationary pressures are under control and noted "wage and price pressures are very moderate."     johnson told a women's group that the u.s. was not seeing the kind of cost pressures of the past.     he said the trade imbalance was a serious trouble spot and strong protectionist pressures, if translated into policies, could ultimately lead to higher inflation and a high interest rate policy by the fed.  reuter &#3;</h3>
