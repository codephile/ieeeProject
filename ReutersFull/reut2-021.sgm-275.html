	<h3>japan's ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) on tuesdayhose former finance minister noboru takeshita to be the next prime minister, replacing yasuhiro nakasone whose term ends on october 30.     ldp officials told reuters the choice was made by nakasone after takeshita and two other contenders failed in marathon closed-door meetings to agree who should be japan's next leader.     they were vying for the presidency of the ldp, a post which automatically carries with it the premiership by virtue of the party's parliamentary majority.  reuter &#3;</h3>
