	<h3>the house approved by a 230-112 vote and sent to the senate a trillion dlr spending budget that calls for domestic and defence cuts and higher taxes to reduce the 1988 deficit.     the measure proposes cutting the deficit from 171 billion dlrs to 133 billion dlrs using the non partisan congressional budget office calculations, or to 108 billion dlrs using more optimistic assumptions of president reagan--whose own budget was defeated earlier.  reuter &#3;</h3>
