	<h3>production of fish meal by the three south american producers -- chile, peru and equador -- last year reached 2.5 mln tonnes, equalling the record output of 1970, the international association of fish meal manufacturers (iafmm) said.     however, iafmm said in a statement that it expected chilean and peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987 to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the last quarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in chile for the month of february and to adverse fishing conditions in peru in the same month.     the statement added that, due to technical market promotion and energetic sales by chile and peru, the stock position at the end of the year remained reasonable.     fish meal production outside south america decreased slightly, falling from 114,400 to 111,100 tonnes.     the iafmm said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in west germany, scandinavian countries, eastern europe and the far east, but fell in the u.s. and remained static in the u.k.     it added that fish meal consumption had suffered from competition with feed grade tallow in the u.s. and with skimmed milk powder in the u.k.     iafmm figures for fish oil production in the main producing nations, in thousands of tonnes, were -                     oct/dec            jan/dec                  1986    1985       1986     1985  chile             22       8        109       76  peru              56      28        238      104  norway            14      14         97      130  iceland           44      52        102      118  denmark           20      18         88       77  u.s.              10       8        152      129  japan             67      91        213      249  reuter &#3;</h3>
