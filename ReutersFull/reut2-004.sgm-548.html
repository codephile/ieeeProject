	<h3>a marketing loan for u.s. wheat, feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus production situation and would be extremely costly, sen. rudy boschwitz (r-minn.) said.     "i think i would not support a marketing loan now," he told the house agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused support on decoupling legislation, the boren/boschwitiz bill.     a market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more production, especially in high-yielding areas, would be much more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans and not increase exports significantly, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
