	<h3>a decision by colombia to open coffee export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld, gilberto arango, president of the private exporters' association, told reuters.     colombia today opened export registrations for april and may, with the national coffee growers' federation setting no limit.     since the start of the coffee year last october, private exporters were on average allowed 350,000 bags of 60 kilos per month.     "traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing heavy sales. even today it pressured the market. but it will quickly become apparent that colombia does not intend to go over the top," arango said in an interview.     "colombia's marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. no targets for volume will be set. we will react to market factors adequately. colombia has no intention to give its coffee away," he added.     arango described measures adopted here yesterday, including a lower export registration price, as a major change in colombia's coffee marketing policy.     the export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70 kilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs).     the government announced a more flexible policy of reintegro, in order to closely reflect market trends, which arango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will undoubtedly be more actively present in the market.     a frequent gap between international market prices and the reintegro was unlikely to recur, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
