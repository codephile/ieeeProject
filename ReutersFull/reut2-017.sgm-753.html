	<h3>federal deposit insurance corp chairman l. william seidman told a bankers' meeting he thinks more banks will follow citicorp <cci> and chase manhattan <cmb> in building up their reserves to meet latin american debt problems.     seidman, speaking to an american bankers association trade conference, said he did not think regulators would play as big a role in encouraging banks to build up their loan-loss reserves as the marketplace would.         my guess is that we as regulators won't become the key factor. i think the market system will get most of the other banks to follow suit," seidman told some 3,000 executives attending the aba's national operations and automation conference.     in the past two weeks, citicorp has added three billion dlrs and chase manhattan, 1.6 billion dlrs, to their loan-loss reserves.         "i think that most banks are going to find it irresistible to move forward on the same type of reserving because, if they don't, their future earnings will be penalized as they hold up their reserves on a quarter-by-quarter basis," seidman said.     he said chase and citibank, by setting aside huge amounts at one time,  have put their losses behind them and will show much better future earnings.     that, he said, will put pressure on more banks to follow suit.  reuter &#3;</h3>
