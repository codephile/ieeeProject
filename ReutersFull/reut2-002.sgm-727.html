	<h3>bancroft convertible fund inc, the target of an unfriendly cash offer by <zico investment holdings inc>, said its shareholders approved proposals requiring a 66-2/3 pct affirmative vote of all outstanding shares before fundamental changes in its status could be made.     previously, only a simple majority of outstanding shares was needed to change bancroft's investment status from a diversified to a non-diversified fund, among other things.     bancroft said its board continues to recommend that stockholders not tender their shares to zico, a british virgin islands company which it said had ties to south africa.  reuter &#3;</h3>
