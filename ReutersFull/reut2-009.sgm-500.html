	<h3>treasury secretary james baker said the meeting last month in paris in which finance ministers agreed to keep the dollar at current levels showed that the economic cooperation process was working.     he said that at that meeting the surplus countries committed themselves to strengthening their growth prospects, while the deficit countries agreed to reduce their domestic imbalances.     for its part, he said the united states must press forward with reductions in the federal budget deficit and must continue to oppose protectionist pressures.  reuter &#3;</h3>
