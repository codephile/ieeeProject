	<h3>u.s.-based northwest airlines, a unit of nwa inc <nwa>, has ordered up to 20 of the european airbus industrie <ainp.pa> consortium's planned a340 long-range jets, with an option on a further 10 a330 medium-range jets, in a deal worth more than 2.5 billion dlrs, airbus said in a statement.     the contract gives airbus its first launch customer in the lucrative u.s. market for its long-range jet programme.     last month airbus announced it had a total of 104 commitments from nine customers for the planes. a spokeswoman confirmed today's order was in addition to those commitments.     airbus has been competing with mcdonnell douglas corp <md> in the long-range jet market since the u.s. group formally launched its md-11 plane program at the end of 1986. mcdonnell douglas has won over 100 orders and options for the aircraft.     the northwest order comes after the airline ordered 10 short-range a320 airbus jets, with options on a further 90, last october, giving airbus a foothold in the u.s. market.     european governments, asked to fund 2.5 to three billion dlrs of the airbus a330/340 programs, have said there may not be room in the world aircraft market for airbus's jets.  reuter &#3;</h3>
