	<h3>comex silver futures held sharply higher morning levels at midday, but further advances were checked by overseas and commercial selling.     may was up 12.5 cents at 6.705 dlrs as of 1223 hrs edt. july was up 13.1 cents at 6.785 dlrs, both exactly as they were at 1000 hrs edt this morning.     traders said locals remain long and speculative interest continues. but profit taking has intensified on expectations of a corrective downward move if the market becomes overbought.     some interest has been drawn away from silver by a further record-setting stock market advance.  reuter &#3;</h3>
