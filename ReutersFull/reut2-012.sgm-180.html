	<h3>pacific gas and electric co's plan to change its accounting methods for nuclear plant revenues, together with the prospect of higher higher domestic interest rates, helped push the company's stock price down 2-1/8 to 22, utility analysts and company executives said.     pacific gas said yesterday that a change in the method for accounting for its diablo canyon nuclear power plant revenues will result in a 470 mln dlr reduction in 1987 earnings.     the company also said it intends to continue paying its common stock dividend at the current annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.     but the move also means that the company is not likely to increase its dividend for perhaps as long as three years, said mark luftig, an analyst at salomon brothers inc.     "anybody looking for a dividend increase has been dissapointed (by the announcement)," luftig said.     pacific gas has raised its common stock dividend on a regular basis for the past 10 years, a company spokeswoman said.     in addition, she also pointed out that prospects for higher interest rates may also be affecting pacific gas trading activity.     citicorp <cci> and chase manhattan corp <cmb> yesterday increased their prime lending rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct. it was the first rate increase by the big banks in nearly three years.     utility earnings are sensitive to interest rate increases because of the high levels of borrowings needed to finance ongoing construction projects.     despite the market reaction, first boston corp analyst arlene barnes applauded the pacific gas decision.     "this is a very prudent move on management's part," said barnes.     rather than using accounting tools to reflect income it is not taking in, the company will now account for only the 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plant that regulators are allowing in the form of interim rate relief, barnes said.     pacific gas had been carrying the other 60 pct as a deferred cash receivable and accounted for the non-cash item as income.     "they'll take the hit this year, but at least we'll be looking at an honest earnings picture," barnes also said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
