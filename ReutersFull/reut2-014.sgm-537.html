	<h3>iraq said tonight its forces were battling to dislodge iranian troops from territory they gained during a new three-pronged offensive on the war front near the southern city of basra.     the third high command communique issued during the day said the iranians launched a major overnight assault on the fronts of three iraqi divisions, the qutaiba, muthanna and mohammed al-qassem forces.     it said the iranian troops which attacked the qutaiba front were completely annihilated but the invading force managed to gain some footholds on the other fronts.     "fierce fighting has been raging since dawn today and all morning where our forces succeeded in dislodging the iranians from all the positions they gained at the muthanna front and the situation ended in iraq's favour," the communique said.     it said iraqi forces were continuing counter-attacks to drive the iranians from the few positions they were still holding on the front of the mohammed al-qassem forces.     the precise locations of the three fronts were not given.  reuter &#3;</h3>
