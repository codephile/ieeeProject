	<h3>latin america urgently needs more money if it is to grow its way out of its deepening debt crisis, but fresh ideas about how to stimulate new lending quickly seem to be in short supply.     bankers, officials and academics at a conference organized by the massachusetts institute of technology stressed the importance of proper economic policies and increased private investment. but they offered no glimpse of a grand design to banish the specter of a widespread repudiation of the region's 380 billion dlr debt. "such a solution is still not in sight," said nobel prize-winning economist franco modigliani.     the conference was held against the background of the recent suspension of interest payments by brazil and ecuador, but it was argentine finance secretary mario brodersohn who spelled out most clearly the social and economic strains caused by the need to service billions of dlrs of debt.     brodersohn, who is negotiating currently with foreign banks for a 2.15 billion dlr loan for 1987, says argentina will have to grow at a four pct annual rate between now and 1992 simply to restore per capita income to the level of 1975.     he said the investment needed to fuel this growth can come partly from structural economic reforms at home, but this alone will not be enough.     "we have to reduce the transfer of resources," brodersohn said, adding that mounting economic strains in latin america make this a matter of urgency.     brodersohn and other latin officials, however, did not spell out how this should be achieved.     the creditors' strategy, spelled out by u.s. treasury secretary james baker in october 1985, is to spur additional lending by private banks and multilateral development banks in return for economic reforms.     but there was a widespread recognition at the conference that the baker plan has fallen well short of expectations.     miguel urrutia, a senior official of the inter-american development bank, for instance, said iadb lending had actually declined in 1986 and had started slowly in 1987.     mexico is due to sign a 7.7 billion dlr loan on friday that will be the first major facility under the baker plan, which called for net new bank lending between 1986 and 1988, a target that morris goldstein of the international monetary fund said is now optimistic.     deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-american affairs paul taylor acknowledged that the baker plan "has not yet succeeded as well as we hoped."     but if the debtors at the conference were hoping to hear an official commitment to try a new tack, they must have been disappoiunted.     ted truman, director of the international finance diviision at the federal reserve board, said banks were short-sighted in not lending promptly and in the amounts called for by baker.     he said some streamlining of the lending process may be needed, but added, "i see no alterantive to the present course of responsible cooperation."     a major theme at the conference, however, was that the world economy might not continue to cooperate while the debtors and creditors muddle along. if export markets dry up because of recession or protectionism, speakers warned, latin america will be even more hard-pressed to service its debts.     rimmer de vries, chief international economist at morgan guaranty trust co, said he was very concerned that world economic growth of three to 3-1/2 pct cannot be sustained and that west germany and japan wowuld not take up the slack in the world economy that will arise as the u.s. narrows its trade deficit.     "there's a deflationary force coming down the mountain, and i don't know who's going to be rolled over," de vries said. he called for a new lending initiative with a wide menu of options as alternatives to pure new money.     "can we not manage this lending a bit more imaginatively?" he asked the conference.     but new ideas take time to devise and implement, and brazil's suspension of interest payments shows that the aptience of debtors might be wearing thin.     persio arida, a former director of the brazizlian central bank who was a key architect of that country's cruzado plan to curb inflation, said there is an "incentive problem" throughout latin america.  reuter &#3;</h3>
