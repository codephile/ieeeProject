	<h3>harley-davidson inc said it is petitioning the international trade commission to lift import taxes on japanese motorcycle manufacturers.     harley-davidson said it no longer needed tariff relief to compete with the japanese. it said president reagan imposed the tariff in april 1983 after harley-davidson convinced the administration the japanese were eroding the u.s. motorcycle industry by flooding the market with its own models.     harley-davidson said it has increased its market share of the heavyweight motorcycle to 19.4 pct in 1986 from a record low 12.5 pct in 1983.  reuter &#3;</h3>
