	<h3>the european community (ec) cereals trade lobby organisation coceral said it has written to ec farm commissioner frans andriessen to propose a new system for sales into intervention, which it claims could save the ec budget money.     it proposes that applications for intervention be made through a certificate valid for execution three months later. if during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere, he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct premium.     coceral argues that this would restore the original function of intervention as a safety net and would end the present situation in which produce is often sold into intervention as a precaution.  reuter &#3;</h3>
