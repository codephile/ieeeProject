	<h3><nissan motor manufacturing (uk) ltd> has reached agreement with <lombard north central plc> of the u.k. to build plants and boost the local content in nissan's u.k. produced cars to 60 pct in 1988 from 40 to 50 pct, the nissan motor co ltd <nsan.t> said.     the agreement will allow the cars to be designated as domestically manufactured rather than imported vehicles, nissan said. the agreement was reached through negotiations with the british government and the european community (ec) after they threatened to impose duties on imports.     according to the 230 mln stg contract, lombard north central, an affiliate of national westminster bank plc <nwbl.l>, will build and lease plants for engine assembly, body panel pressing and resin moulding by 1988. they will be near the existing nissan plant in sunderland in north-east england, nissan said. the sunderland plant currently produces 24,000 bluebird cars annually for the british market.     nissan hopes to begin u.k. exports to europe in 1991 after building an engine machining plant which would boost output to 100,000 units a year and local content to above 80 pct, in accordance with ec requests, the spokesman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
