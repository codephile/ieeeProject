	<h3>marion laboratories inc's stock rose sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts monday, traders and analysts said.     the company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987, ending june 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago.     that pronouncement encouraged analyst david crossen of sanford c. bernstein and co to raise his earnings estimates for the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to his previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. last year the company earned 70 cts a share.     marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2.     at the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, marion's president fred lyons jr. said wall street eanrings estimates of 1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 "are expected to cause even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low."     lyons said the strong performance in the second half of this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of 90 mg and 120 mg cardizem tablets. analyst crossen said that cardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year.     crossen said "because marion is still just a small company, the growth of cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom line." he raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share.     "the company has a broad new product pipeline in the industry and as far as i am concerned, it is the most innovative company in the business," he said.     for the five years through 1991, crossen expects marion to have a growth rate of 55 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
