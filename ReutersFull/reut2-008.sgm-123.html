	<h3>taiwan is holding discussions with the asian development bank (adb) to try to settle a political dispute over its representation in the bank, a foreign ministry spokesman said.     taiwan, one of the founders of the 47-member adb, boycotted the annual meeting last year to protest against a decision to change its membership name to "taipei, china" after the admission of peking.     the foreign ministry spokesman said a decision on whether taiwan would attend the next meeting in japan on april 27-29 would depend on the results of the talks.     "we are looking for a fair and just solution to the question of representation," he said.     in manila, an adb spokesman declined to comment on the statement.     "we have no comment at all," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
