	<h3>at least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240 mln pesos have been smuggled into the philippines over the past few months, the manila bulletin newspaper said, quoting an official in the national food authority (nfa).     the official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage and corruption among customs and coast guard personnel have jeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which was aimed at saving foreign currency.     the newspaper quoted nfa marketing director jig tan as saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.     tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150 hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.     the newspaper quoted linda geraldez, an nfa statistician, as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total inventory at the end of the january/june crop season is expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.  reuter &#3;</h3>
