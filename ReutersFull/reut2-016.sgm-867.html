	<h3>ford motor co said it is developing an aluminum space frame for its probe v concept car using extruded stretch-formed aluminum that could lead to new techniques for building production cars in the future.     it said the frame would reduce vehicle weight and cost while maintaining structural integrity and crashworthiness. the frame has fewer parts than conventional steel frames, ford said.  the company said the lighter weight would allow smaller powertrains and suspensions, further reducing weight and improving fuel economy.     ford said in addition, extrusion dies cost 1,000 to 12,000 dlrs each, compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars for steel stamping dies, and using extruded aluminum the number of welds in a car could be reduced to about 40 from over 2,000.  reuter &#3;</h3>
