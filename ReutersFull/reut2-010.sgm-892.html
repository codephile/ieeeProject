	<h3>centronics corp said its board declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding common share payable to holders of record april 9.     the rights, which will expire 10 years later, will entitle shareholders to buy one-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred at an exercise price of 20 dlrs.     the rights will be exercisable only if some one acquires 30 pct or more of centronic's common or announces an offer which would result in ownership of 30 pct or more of the stock.     centronics said its board will be entitled to redeem the rights at two cts per right at any time before a 30 pct position has been acquired.     if the rights become exercisable, the company said, those held by shareholders other than the owner of 30 pct or more of the stock will entitle the holder to purchase a number of common shares having a market value twice the right's exercise price.  reuter &#3;</h3>
