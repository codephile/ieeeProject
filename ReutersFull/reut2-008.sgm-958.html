	<h3>calumet industries inc said it expects to report a loss from operations for its second quarter ending march 31, despite a strong unit sales increase.     in the same year-ago period the company reported net income of 366,953 dlrs, or 18 cts a share.     chairman s. mark salvino said the expected loss is primarily due to depressed product prices not recovering the increasing cost of crude oil.     salvino also said steadier crude prices and the reduced rate of refinery production should increase product prices and lead to a return to more normal profit margins.     he reported that the 23 mln dlr hydrocal ii system under construction at the company's refinery in princeton, la., is on schedule and production will begin early in fiscal 1988.  reuter &#3;</h3>
