	<h3>no action has been taken yet on the reagan adminstration's offer to escort kuwaiti oil tankers through the gulf, but the issue is being discussed, u.s. secretary of defence caspar weinberger said.     the offer was made to kuwait in light of iran's deployment of chinese-built missiles to cover the entrance to the gulf.     weinberger told reporters prior to a speech at texas christian university that he did not think iran and the united states were moving towards a potential conflict, adding that the straits of hormuz at the mouth of the gulf were still "free water."  reuter &#3;</h3>
