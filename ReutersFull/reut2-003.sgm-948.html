	<h3>the recent purchase of 1.5 mln tonnes of u.s. corn by japan and 600,000 tonnes by south korea suggests that the two countries' demand for reliable supplies of corn is increasing, the u.s. agriculture department said.     in its world production and trade report, the department said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in exportable supplies of argentine corn and uncertainty over the availability of south african and chinese corn.     with these corn purchases, japan is committed to buying 7.7 mln tonnes of u.s. corn in 1986/87 (sept-aug), nearly 400,000 tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date.     south korea's cumulative commitments amount to 2.5 mln tonnes, up 1.5 mln compared to last year, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
