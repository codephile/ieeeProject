	<h3>the midamerica commodity exchange, an affiliate of the chicago board of trade, cbt, that offers smaller versions of several futures contracts traded on other exchanges, will begin trading in its new quarters within the cbt complex on march 30, the cbt announced.     concurrent with the move from its current site a few blocks away, the trading hours of the midam's treasury bond futures contract will expand to between 0720 and 1515 local time from 0800 to 1415 currently.     the midam's t-bond contract has a face value half the size of the cbt's 100,000 dlr t-bond contract, the most active futures contract traded.     the midam also offers smaller-sized futures and options on currencies, precious metals, grains and livestock.  reuter &#3;</h3>
