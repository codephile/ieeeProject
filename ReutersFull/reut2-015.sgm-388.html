	<h3>rio tinto-zinc corp plc <rtzl.l>, rtz, said the predicted rise in industrial production in the u.s. and europe should boost its 1987 performance.     consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have weakened. the oil price in u.s. dlrs is above the 1986 average, and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.     the company was commenting in a statement on its 1986 results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year. pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.     rtz said the excellent performance of its expanding range of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in oil prices.     industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of the total. trading performance improved at wholly-owned subsidiaries rtz borax ltd, rtz cement ltd, rtz chemicals ltd and rtz pillar ltd. first time contributions from recent investment and acquisitions mainly in speciality chemicals and minerals also aided performance.     metals activities contributed 83 mln stg to net profit.                  &#3;</h3>
