	<h3>argentine treasury secretary mario brodersohn said the country is near accord with creditor banks on refinancing about 30 billion dlrs of foreign debt.     brodersohn, in an interview from washington with argentine television, said saturday the major obstacles to an agreement with creditor banks had been overcome. "only details remain to be resolved," he said.     economy minister juan sourrouille on thursday in a speech at the imf accused creditor banks of standing in the way of an accord by demanding conditions incompatible with argentina's imf standby program.     brodersohn said that since there "has been progress. i'd say that we are now working on the fine print of the agreement."     negotiations between argentina and the banks have been stuck over differences on the question of capitalisation of the debt as well as on-lending programs.     argentina has resisted a renewal of on-lending programs and sought an agreement whereby creditor banks would invest a fresh dollar for every dollar of debt capitalised.  reuter &#3;</h3>
