	<h3>the federal reserve was detected buying dollars for yen in the open market as the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 144.60 yen in nervous late morning trading, currency dealers said.      they said the size of the intervention was relatively modest so far but it was a clear indication that the u.s. remained committed to the late february paris currency stabilization accord, which was reaffirmed in washington last night.     a fed spokeswoman had no comment on the dealer reports.     the dollar hovered around 144.70 just before midday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
