	<h3>greece aims to reduce foreign borrowing to 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986, and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing payments, the governor of the bank of greece, dimitris halikias, said.     he told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded immediate needs, but greece wanted to take advantage of low international interest rates in order to make servicing payments at a lower cost.     greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at end-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, halikias said.     he said the extra funds available to greece this year will go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. he did not give figures.     he said greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year austerity program it adopted in october, 1985 cut its current account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record 3.3 billion in 1985.     halikias said he was "fairly optimistic" greece would reach a current account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year.     he said domestic demand has fallen, reducing the need for imports, while greek exports are becoming more competitive.     economy ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion dlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the same. 1985 period, while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs from 11.4 billion.  reuter &#3;</h3>
