	<h3>confronted by new hostilities involving u.s. forces in the gulf, the u.s. senate voted to end republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that could give congress a larger role in gulf policy.     the measure, however, does not require president reagan to comply with the 1973 war powers act as does a related senate bill. the controversial war powers act could require a pullout of u.s. forces from the gulf.     the senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires reagan to report to congress on gulf policy within 60 days and calls for a resolution to be passed in the house and senate on the situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.     the resolution could be about any gulf-related issue, including an expression of support or of disapproval for reagan's policy of protecting 11 kuwaiti tankers from iran in the waterway. the pentagon said the 12th u.s.-protected convoy began moving through the gulf early tuesday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
