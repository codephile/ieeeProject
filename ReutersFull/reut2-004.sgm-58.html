	<h3>the tokyo stock exchange said in a statement it is considering reducing brokerage fees on yen convertible bonds.     the cut would be in response to a planned increase in securities transaction tax to 26 yen per 10,000 yen from 4.5 as part of the government's proposed tax reform bills, securities house managers said.     under the current system, investors must also pay 0.6 pct of face value as brokerage fee to securities houses for transactions involving principal over 30 mln yen.     the exchange's draft revision sets brokerage fee percentage rates in inverse proportion to the size of amounts transacted, market sources said.     details of rates on transactions under 30 mln yen have yet to be worked out, an exchange spokesman said.     the news had little immediate impact on the convertible bond market because participants are unsure when the new rates will be introduced and because the timing of parliamentary approval of the tax reform bills is uncertain due to opposition to them, securities dealers said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
