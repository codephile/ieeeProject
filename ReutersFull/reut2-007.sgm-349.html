	<h3>saudi arabia's crown prince abdullah ibn abdulaziz said in remarks published today there would be important progress in the next few months on arab and islamic efforts to end the iraq-iran war.     prince abdullah, in an interview with the kuwait magazine al-majalis, carried by the official saudi press agency (spa), said: "important progress ... will happen during the coming two or three months."     he said, "we have always appealed to the brothers in iraq and iran to stop the bloodshed ... in this meaningless war between two islamic countries."     all international and regional efforts so far to end the 6-1/2-year-old war have failed. iran says there can be no peace until iraqi president saddam hussein is ousted.     prince abdullah said iraq had always responded to islamic and arab peace calls.  reuter &#3;</h3>
