	<h3>the canadian unit of general motors corp and the union representing its 40,000 workers remain far apart over local issues in contract talks two days from a threatened strike, a union spokesman said.     the deepest divisions appeared to be between general motors of canada ltd and the canadian auto workers local representing 17,000 workers at an assembly plant in oshawa, ontario, union spokesman wendy cuthbertson said.     "local 222 is miles apart," said cuthbertson. the local assembles full-size pick-up trucks, the buick regal and the pontiac 6000.     local issues there included shift schedules, transfers and working conditions, union president bob white said.     the union has threatened to strike at 1000 edt/1400 gmt on thursday unless it has reached a tentative settlement.     bargaining was scheduled to continue late into tuesday night in an effort to avert a walkout, said cuthbertson.     on monday, the union accepted an economic offer from gm canada that largely matched the pay-and-benefit pattern reached earlier at chrysler corp <c> and ford motor co <f> units.  reuter &#3;</h3>
