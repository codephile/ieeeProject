	<h3>u.s. energy futures traded consistently above yesterday's closing prices in thin activity this morning with underlying support from april 15-day forward north sea brent crude, traders said.     april brent traded as high as 19.40 dlrs a barrel today, or more than 1.00 dlr above may brent prices, because of a supply squeeze, according to traders.     "u.s. energy futures are probably influenced by april brent more than anything else today," said john o'connell, assistant vice president at refco, inc.     may crude was up 18 cts to 18.85 dlrs a barrel.      "there is no reason to sell energy futures at these prices because the fundamentals have not changed," said o'connell, adding that the opec pricing/production accord continues to hold.     mixed trade participants dominated crude futures while local traders were featured in products, traders said. they said u.s. energy futures ran into resistance at today's highs.     may heating oil was up 0.46 cent at 49.25 cts a gallon after trading within a narrow 0.30-cent range. may unleaded gasoline was up 0.61 cent to 53.55 cts a gallon, at the high end of a 0.35-cent range.  reuter &#3;</h3>
