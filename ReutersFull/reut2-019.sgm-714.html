	<h3>brazil's motor industry, facing the worst crisis of its history, today sent thousands of workers on collective leave because of a sharp drop in demand.     company spokesmen said autolatina, which last friday laid off 4,000 workers, sent nearly 9,000 of its 56,500 employees in brazil on collective leave until july 12.     general motors do brasil said it would give 10 days' leave to part of its 22,000 workforce from wednesday.     fiat is giving 2,000 workers a month's holiday from july 6.     jacy mendonca, industrial relations director of autolatina, a merger of volkswagen and ford in brazil and argentina, said last week this would be the worst year ever for brazil's auto industry.     he forecast that 1987 would be worse than 1981, when domestic sales dropped 40 pct to 580,000 units.     "this year we'll be lucky if we can sell 550,000 units," he said.     since friday there have been two positive developments for the industry. the government announced that it was scrapping a 15 pct surcharge on all new car sales.     the surcharge, created in july last year, was originally set at 30 pct to help curb a car-buying boom and was in theory refundable.     brazilian car distributors, which since june 16 had halted all car purchases in protest against high government taxes, responded to the government move by resuming purchases.     but industry spokesmen said taxes on vehicles were still high, 108 pct, and the sector still faced major problems.  reuter &#3;</h3>
