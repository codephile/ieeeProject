	<h3>ncr corp is very optimistic that it will post record revenues and profits for 1987, charles e. exley jr, chairman and president, said.     "much of our considerable optimism about the future is based on the strength of a continuing flow of new products," exley told a meeting of securities analysts. "our current position is the strongest in modern ncr history with new-generation offerings deliverable in every major category this year."     for 1986, ncr's earnings rose nine pct, to 3.42 dlrs a share, on sales that increased 13 pct, to 4.9 billion dlrs.     during the balance of 1987, exley said ncr will pay close attention to increasing its penetration of major accounts, expanding its third-party distribution channels and continuing its introduction of new products.     "in 1986, new products introduced within the proceding 36 months accounted for more than 65 pct of our major equipment order activity," he said.     "at the end of two months," he added," i can say we are off to a good start" for 1987.  reuter &#3;</h3>
