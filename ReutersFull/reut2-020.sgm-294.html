	<h3>avon products inc, which earlier reported lower third quarter profits, said its fourth quarter and full year earnings will exceed the year ago results due to strong sales in its domestic cosmetics business and an improved economic situtation in brazil.     last year avon earned 158.7 mln dlrs or 2.23 dlrs a share on sales of 2.9 billion dlrs.     in the current third quarter avon said its earnings dropped 12 pct to 37 cts a share because of a wage and price freeze in brazil, one of the company's four major operating areas.         "themance of the domestic beauty business in the fourth quarter should more than offset the impact of brazil on earnings," said hicks waldron, avon's chairman and chief executive, in a statement.     john cox, avon's spokesman, told reuters that brazil's economic problems costs the company 10 cts a share or about seven mln dlrs in profits in the third quarter. he said that about half of that loss was offset by the strong performance of the company's domestic cosmetics business.     for the nine month period, avon's earnings were flat.         avon also said in a statement that an initial public offering in japan for up to 40 pct of its japanese subsidiary, which is expected to exceed 200 mln dlrs, may not take place as scheduled in november.     avon said the offering will depend on world stock market conditions.  reuter &#3;</h3>
