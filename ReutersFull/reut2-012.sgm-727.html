	<h3>remaining recoverable gas reserves in the areas held by the santos ltd <stos.s>-led cooper basin joint ventures have been upgraded to 2,721.7 billion cubic feet (bcf) from the 2,466 estimated last may, santos said.     the upgrading followed a re-review by consultant <coles nikiforuk pennell associates> in light of the large number of gas finds since may 1986, santos said in a statement.     this means that total contractual commitments of 2,455.5 bcf to <the australian gas light co> of new south wales and the pipeline authority of south australia can be met with spare gas available for sale in south australia, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
