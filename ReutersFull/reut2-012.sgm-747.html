	<h3>the central bank issued 5.65 billion dlrs worth of certificates of deposit (cds), boosting cd issues so far this year to 147.58 billion, a bank spokesman told reuters.     the new cds, with maturities of six months, one year and two years, carry interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to 5.12 pct, he said.     the issues are intended to help curb the growth of the m-1b money supply which has grown as a result of increasing foreign exchange reserves.     the reserves hit a record 53 billion u.s. dlrs last month.  reuter &#3;</h3>
