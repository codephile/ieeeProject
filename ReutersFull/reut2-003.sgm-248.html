	<h3>the dutch current account surplus fell 5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion guilders, the finance ministry said in a statement.     the surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the statement said, but gave no details. earlier today, the official planning agency cpb said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987.     the visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6 billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms of exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer spending and investment increased.     while the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices.     the current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the finance ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls.     the fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for the first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
