	<h3>loans and advances from the dutch central bank to the commercial banks fell 1.01 billion guilders to 9.5 billion guilders in the week ending march 30, the bank's weekly return showed.     dealers said payments by the dutch state, partly in the form of civil service wages, had outweighed payments to the state, causing the money market deficit to ease.     the treasury's account with the bank dropped 960 mln guilders to 6.5 billion guilders.     liabilities in gold or foreign currency rose 200 mln to 11.9 billion guilders.     dealers said it was more likely that the alteration in this item on the weekly return indicated normal commercial foreign exchange business rather than intervention by the central bank.      the bank itself does not disclose information on intervention.     seasonal variation brought bank notes in circulation up 190 mln guilders to 29.7 billion guilders.     total gold and currency reserves rose 173 mln guilders to 56.4 billion guilders.     call money and period rates were barely changed in the week. today all were traded at 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
