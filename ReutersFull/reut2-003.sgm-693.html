	<h3>the federal reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to add temporary reserves via customer or system repurchase agreements, economists said.     most economists said the fed will inject reserves indirectly via customer repurchases, but they added that the fed might opt for a direct injection of reserves via overnight system repurchases.     federal funds opened at 6-3/8 pct and eased to 6-5/16 pct in early trading. funds averaged 6.29 pct yesterday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
