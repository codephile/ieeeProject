	<h3>canadian bonds recouped some opening losses to trade unchanged to mildly lower in quiet, mostly  uneventful early activity, dealers said.     the market opened 1/4 lower on weaker u.s. credit markets, but later rebounded in tandem with american prices, which reacted to a firming u.s. currency, the dealers noted. many investors stayed sidelined, awaiting clearer economic signals.     the benchmark canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001 fell 1/8 to 106-1/4 1/2 and the 8-1/2 pct of 2011 was unchanged at 97-3/8 5/8.  reuter &#3;</h3>
