	<h3>the european <airbus industrie> consortium is to change the lead engine on its a-340 aircraft because the high-technology superfan engine will not be ready by 1992, a company spokesman said.    airbus has chosen the franco-u.s. cfm-56-s3 engines to replace the <international aero engine> (iae) consortium's superfan. the spokesman added the new engine, to be produced by general electric co of the u.s. and snecma of france, can provide greater thrust than the iae rival.     the spokesman said the iae consortium, which includes pratt and whitney of the u.s. and britain's <rolls royce>, is unable to supply its superfan engines in time for mid-1992 when the a-340 is due to become operational.     airbus signed an agreement with iae last december, replacing an earlier accord with ge and <snecma>, whose cfm-56 engine could then offer no more than a 28,600 lbs thrust, compared to the proposed superfan's 30,000 lbs.     the latest version of the cfm-56, however, can provide a 30,600 lbs thrust.     the airbus spokesman said the consortium's decision did not exclude the iae superfan, once ready, being offered as an alternative engine on the a-340 as the superfan was more fuel-efficient than the cfm engine.     the spokesman said airbus expected iae to come back with some proposals on superfan's new production timetable within the next few weeks or months.  reuter &#3;</h3>
