	<h3>deputy assistant treasury secretary james conrow said he was exceedingly pessimistic that congress will approve the reagan administration's proposed 1988 funding for the multilateral development banks.     speaking to an international development conference, conrow said it appears almost certain that congress will opt to cut spending for international programs before they cut into domestic programs.     he said that in such an environment "foreign aid will lose and lose big."     he said that this means the multilateral development bank funding proposal will probably not "be supported and we will get cuts."     the administration has proposed development bank funding of 1.8 billion dlrs for fiscal year 1988. in addition, it is seeking about 290 mln dlrs in catch-up from funding that had been reduced in prior years.     conrow defended the record of the banks in recent years, saying that they had been rightly pressing debtor countries to reform their domestic economic policies.     he said that this means the multilateral development bank funding proposal will probably not "be supported and we will get cuts."     the administration has proposed development bank funding of 1.8 billion dlrs for fiscal year 1988. in addition, it is seeking about 290 mln dlrs in catch-up from funding that had been reduced in prior years.     conrow defended the record of the banks in recent years, saying that they had been rightly pressing debtor countries to reform their domestic economic policies.     he said most of the loans made by the development banks go to countries that the united states would like to see helped.     conrow said the u.s. financial commitment to the banks allows them to substantially leverage their economic strength, by getting assistance from other countries and by borrowing in the capital markets.  reuter &#3;</h3>
