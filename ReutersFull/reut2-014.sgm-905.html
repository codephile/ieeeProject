	<h3>norway will from june require finance institutions and insurance companies to report lending volume to the central bank once a month rather than quarterly in a bid to tighten domestic lending, finance ministry officials said.     norwegian bank association president trond reinertsen told reuters the new rule would make it more difficult for banks to transfer funds to financial and insurance companies for lending.     banks have in the past used the two month lapse in loan registration to transfer money for lending to finance and insurance groups to avoid penalty reserve requirements for lending in excess of government set ceilings.     the new rule brings loan reporting requirements for insurance and finance companies in line with those already applied to commercial banks, ministry officials said.     borrowers have increasingly sought loans from finance and insurance companies after the central bank last year clamped down on what it called excessive bank lending.     bank lending dropped by five billion crowns in january from 260 billion crowns the previous month in response to the stricter penalty reserve requirements, oslo bankers said.     they said recent central bank cuts in the overnight rate it charges banks might offset new pressure on interest rates.  reuter &#3;</h3>
