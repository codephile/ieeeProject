	<h3>citicorp expects net income in its individual banking sector to top one billion dlrs by 1993, compared with 462 mln dlrs in 1986, said richard braddock, head of citicorp's individual banking division.     "we can double our earnings over the next five to seven years," he told a banking analysts meeting, adding that this forecast may be on the conservative side.     he said that bank card operations and the new york branch system would continue to turn in hefty profits but also picked out other developing areas, such as u.s. mortgage and international consumer, as major potential earners.     braddock and his sector heads made the following more specific predictions:     - cost of funds and net credit loss levels in the u.s. bankcard unit will taper off in coming years from 1986's relatively inflated levels.     - customer net revenue in the mortgage banking area will rise to 464.7 mln dlrs in 1987 from 374.3 mln in 1986.     - the international consumer business will show 22 pct compound annual growth in earnings between 1986 and 1992.     - private banking earnings will hit 100 mln dlrs in 1987 and top 200 mln dlrs in 1992.  reuter &#3;</h3>
