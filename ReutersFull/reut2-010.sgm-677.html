	<h3>sumitomo metal mining co said it will raise its monthly nickel output to around 1,750 tonnes from april 1 from 1,650 now because of increased domestic demand, mainly from stainless steel makers.     sumitomo produced 1,800 tonnes of a nickel a month until end-1986, but cut output in january because of stagnant demand, a company official said.     calendar 1987 production is likely to fall to around 20,000 tonnes from 22,000 in 1986 as a result of the first quarter reduction, he said.     sumitomo is japan's only nickel producer.  reuter &#3;</h3>
