	<h3>the u.s. house of representatives, in a key procedural vote, today opposed a grant of 40 mln dlrs to the nicaraguan rebels until president reagan accounts for previous aid, including proceeds from u.s. arms sales to iran.     the major test of house sentiment came several hours before the chamber was to take a final vote on the assistance.     however, the 227 to 198 vote on a procedural matter was seen as a temporary defeat for reagan, who has made aid to the "contra" rebels one of his major foreign policy initiatives.    congressional leaders, including foes of contra aid, have acknowledged that despite today's rebuff, which was expected, it will be virtually impossible to prevent the 40 mln dlrs, which was approved last year, from going through.     even if the senate goes along with the house in postponing the aid, reagan will veto the legislation and congress is not expected to be able to override the veto.     but house speaker jim wright, a texas democrat, said today's vote was important because it would "send a message" to reagan that his contra program was in trouble.  reuter &#3;</h3>
