	<h3>the west german government's independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman friedhelm ost said.     a statement released by ost after a meeting of chancellor helmut kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two pct was achievable.     it added the council believed "an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for."     ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on west germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase.     the government regularly uses the term "changed external economic factors" when referring to the fall of the dollar, which has severely damaged west german exports. bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but could still fall below the 1986 level.     along with other leading industrial countries, west germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in paris in february aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.     the stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the west german government ahead of next week's seven nation summit in venice, where bonn is expected to be pressed by the u.s. and other partners to boost its economy.     west german government officials have stressed bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.     the bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.     the experts' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last november when two pct growth was forecast.     many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports. the government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct, compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
