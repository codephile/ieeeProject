	<h3>the u.s. food and drug administration has allowed icn pharmaceuticals inc to resume testing its ribavirin experimental aids drug, according to icn.     "our safety concerns are not of sufficient magnitude to withhold approval of further clinical studies designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ribavirin," the fda told icn chairman milan panic in an october 16 letter made public by icn.     an fda spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the letter.     icn's tests of the drug on humans were blocked last spring after the fda decided there was insufficient evidence of its effectiveness against two common aids-related conditions.     the tests had been intended to determine whether ribavirin was effective against aids-related complex (arc) and lymphadenopathy syndrome or las.     fda commissioner frank young disclosed in may, however, that the agency was investigating "suspicious" test results submitted by icn on the antiviral drug. young said he had personally scolded icn officials for making exaggerated claims about the drug. in addition, a house subcommittee said it was probing icn for possible trading or financial irregularities.     today, the fda said it was letting icn test ribavirin for safety and effectiveness in 32 patients with arc and las.  reuter &#3;</h3>
