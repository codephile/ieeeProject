	<h3>a treasury department spokesman refused comment on statements by robert ortner, undersecretary of economic affairs for the commerce department, that the japanese yen was undervalued.     ortner, senior economist at the commerce department, told an export-import bank conference "the yen is still a little bit undervalued," and "could go up another 10 or 15 pct."     asked for reaction, a treasury spokesman said officials were aware of ortner's comments but had no intention of making any comment on them.     ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, said he thought the u.s. dollar was "fairly priced" against most european currencies and added "i do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen," he said.     but the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, ortner said, because it is undervalued against the dollar.     the united states and major trade allies west germany, france, britain, japan and canada met recently in paris to discuss maintaining stability in international currency values.   reuter &#3;</h3>
