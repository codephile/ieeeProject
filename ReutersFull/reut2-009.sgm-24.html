	<h3>eastman kodak co said it plans to sell its 2.3 pct holding in icn pharmaceuticals <icn> and part of its nine pct holdings in viratek <vira>.     it said the purpose of the investments had been to lay the groundwork for the creation of its nucleic acid research institute.     since that has been achieved, there is no longer any reason to maintain the equity positions, kodak said.     kodak holds 470,000 sahres of icn, currently trading at about 18-3/4 and 700,000 of viratek, trading at 44.  reuter &#3;</h3>
