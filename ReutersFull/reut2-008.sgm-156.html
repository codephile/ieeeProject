	<h3>the somali government has submitted to parliament a law offering foreign investors generous terms including customs duty exemption on all capital goods, minister of state for planning yusuf ali osman said.     osman told reporters yesterday the new law opened all sectors of the somali economy to foreign investment and allowed unrestricted remittance of profits and repatriation of the whole value of the investment after five years.     the law gives investors guarantees against nationalisation and permits them to retain 50 pct of their export earnings in external accounts, a privilege available to somali exporters since last year, he added.     osman described the new terms as very attractive and said he expected the bill to go through within a week. details of the previous investment laws were not immediately available.     somalia opened its economy to private investment in the early 1980s but few foreign firms have put money into the country. osman said the two largest private foreign investments were in a banana exporting venture and in a small boatyard.  reuter &#3;</h3>
