	<h3>shareholders in banque bruxelles lambert <bblb.b>, bbl, authorised the bank to increase capital by five billion francs to 20 billion in the next five years, a bank spokesman said.     bbl, belgium's second largest commercial bank, had failed to win shareholder approval for the move last month because of a lack of quorum. no quorum was required today.     bbl has already raised over 5.5 billion francs in new capital since april 1985. board president jacques thierry reiterated at the meeting that bbl had no plans to raise more capital in the near future.  reuter &#3;</h3>
