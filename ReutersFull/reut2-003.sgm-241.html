	<h3>dart group <darta> is likely seeking to buy supermarkets general <sgl>, analysts said.     "there's been rumors that they've taken a position in the company, said wood gundie analyst edward comeau.     last year, dart group, owner of auto trak inc and crown books, competed against kohlberg, kravis to acquire safeway stores inc.     the company later reached an accord under which it would buy 20 pct of the company after kohlberg kravis completed its leveraged buyout of the company.     the company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln to 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts.      dart group corp was not immediately available for comment.     jerry ballan, analyst with conner ballan division of edward viner and co, said, "they <dart> has been rumored to be buying some other supermarkets as well, such as stop and shop."     "my guess is that supermarkets general does not want to be bought out," said ballan.     analysts, however, said supermarkets general is facing problems due to its purity supreme and rickels operations, which might make it difficult to thwart a bid.     supermarkets general is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis.     for the first quarter, comeau predicts the company will earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and should earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987.     "but that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to purity supreme in new england," comeau said.     he said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in that area and that the company has had difficulty with integrating purity supreme with its pathmark store operations.     rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as an operating unit, according to analysts.     analysts said that if dart buys supermarkets general it would probably divest the company's operations.     analyst comeau said "supermarkets general may seek a combination with another supermarket company." &#3;</h3>
