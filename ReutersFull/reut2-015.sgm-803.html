	<h3>rep. john porter, r-ill., introduced in the house of representatives legislation proposed by the reagan administration to slash the u.s. sugar price support, a spokesman for porter said.     the spokesman said the bill was introduced without any changes from the administration's proposal sent to congress last month.     that plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12 cents per pound from 18 cents now. sugar growers would be compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments, to be gradually phased-out through 1990. the payments to growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.     representatives of sugar growers have rejected the proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.  reuter &#3;</h3>
