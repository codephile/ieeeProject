	<h3>international coffee prices could drop to between 70 and 80 cents a lb by next october if no agreement is reached to support the market, jorge cardenas, manager of colombia's national coffee growers' federation said.     speaking at a forum for industrialists, he said one of the reasons was that the market was already saturated and that producers will have excess production and stockpiles of 39 mln (60-kg) bags in 1987.     today, may futures in new york settled at 107.90 cents a lb.  reuter &#3;</h3>
