	<h3>foreigners will be able to invest up to two mln n.z. dlrs in new zealand assets without getting approval from the overseas investment commission, the commission said.     the decision, effective tomorrow raises the threshold from its previous level of 500,000 dlrs, it said in a statement.     "the new level is felt to be more appropriate to objectives given the present cost structure involved in operating a business in new zealand," the commission said. the increase does not apply to the acquisition of shares.  reuter &#3;</h3>
