	<h3>production of a four-megabit superchip, developed jointly by siemens ag <sieg.f> and nv philips gloeilampenfabrieken <pglo.as>, could start by late 1988 or early 1989, west german technology minister heinz riesenhuber told a news conference.     "we have caught up (with) our competitors," a technology ministry spokeswoman said. "now it's a question of who will be first to produce it, and we are in with a good chance."     companies in the united states and japan say they already have a prototype but have not yet reached the production stage.     siemens and philips, together with the west german and dutch governments, have invested a total of 1.4 billion marks in researching and developing the chip.     representatives of the two companies said the sophisticated technology could be used to produce cheaper medical diagnosis instruments and to regulate car fuel consumption and emissions.  reuter &#3;</h3>
