	<h3>laser corp said that costs associated with its defense of two shareholder lawsuits could result in a net loss for 1987.     although laser expects to post earnings from operations for the year, a spokesman said they might be wiped out by legal costs, depending on the length of litigation.     in addition, the company said it will ask shareholders to approve proposals to merge the company into its main subsidiary, reincorporate in delaware and change the company's name.  reuter &#3;</h3>
