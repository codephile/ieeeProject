	<h3>air canada, the state-owned airline, said it plans to begin flights to egypt next year following a bilateral air trade agreement signed between the egyptian and canadian governments.     "egypt has a healthy passenger and cargo air market in which air canada can be a powerful competitor," executive vice-president roger linder said.     the airline said it would like to link the service with one of its european stops.     it said it plans further expansion with destinations in the middle east and asia and a trans-pacific route from canada to the far east.  reuter &#3;</h3>
