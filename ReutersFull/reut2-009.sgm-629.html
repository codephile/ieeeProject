	<h3>bolivia's proposal to repurchase at a deep discount the 900 mln dlrs it owes to foreign commercial banks is likely to be accepted, central bank governor javier nogales iturri said.     speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of the inter-american development bank (iadb) here, nogales said bolivia's bank advisory committee, led by bank of america, is seeking permission from creditor banks worldwide to go ahead with the scheme. more than 50 pct of the banks must give their approval, and nogales said he is confident that this threshold will be reached.     "it's working out very well, and i think we'll get clear majority," nogales said.     a senior banker working on the deal also said that banks are responding positively and said all the legal waivers necessary could be obtained within two months.     bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt in march 1984. hyperinflation has been curbed and public spending trimmed, but its debt is still trading as low as 10 cts on the dollar on the secondary market and many banks have written off most, if not all, of their loans to the country.     bankers see little chance for a substantive recovery in bolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect what they can on the loans.     nogales said bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at a market price. he said some banks might want to hold out for a higher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as a window of opportunity to cut their losses.     bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid that foreign governments, especially the united states and west germany, are providing to help finance the eradication of coca crops. cocaine, although illegal, is bolivia's largest export.     the campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops instead of coca would be financed instead using local currency, nogales said.     because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four pct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased to pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n impact on inflation, he added.     nogales said he did not expect bolivia's debt repurchase to become a model for other debtors in dire straits. "we're not seeking a universal solution," he said."               reuter &#3;</h3>
