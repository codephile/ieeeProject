	<h3>general motors corp believes it must become competitive with other with auto manufacturers in the next five years or cease building its cars in the u.s., a published report said.     the detroit free press quoted gm industrial relations vice-president alfred warren as saying "we've got about three to five years to either get our act together or get out of the business."     "people cannot believe we could stop building automobiles in the united states," he said, adding "i'm sure the electronics people felt the same way."     warren, who will be gm's chief negotiator this summer in labor bargaining on a new contract covering 380,000 u.s. hourly workers, said there will be a greater loss of jobs if gm's share of the u.s. car market continues to decline.     and he added the united automobile workers union must resolve its concerns over job security with gm because its "jobs are at general motors...not somewhere else."     warren said gm may have been "foolish" in the last recession to agree to bring back laid-off uaw members to its parts-making operations because "today we would be better off had we not brought workers back."  reuter &#3;</h3>
