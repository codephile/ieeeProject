	<h3>towle manufacturing co, in chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code, said any plan of reorganization would likely lead to a dilution or cancellation of its common and preferred stock.     the company also said claims for subordinated debentures would likely be paid at less than their 100 pct of their face value, and general unsecured claims would likely be paid without interest. the company has not yet filed a plan of reorganization.     the company said it lost 22 mln dlrs from operations in 1986 against a loss of 67.2 mln dlrs a year ago.     the company also said its independent accountants disclaimed an opinion on the financial statements for 1986 because of questions about its contination as a going concern.     the company said, however, it substantially restructured its business, reducing borrowings on an outstanding credit line to 16.5 mln dlrs in 1986 from 57 mln dlrs a year ago. the company also cut its staff to 820 employees at the end of 1986 from 2,500 a year earlier.  reuter &#3;</h3>
