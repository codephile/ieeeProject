	<h3>china is moving to stabilise world prices of tungsten after fluctuating prices this year affected the country's export earnings, the china daily said.     the paper quoted industry officials as saying they would fix export prices on the basis of the world market, stop smuggling and encourage producers to reduce exports.     current world prices range from 49 to 55 dlrs per tonne unit, but china suffered heavy losses when the price slumped to 39 dlrs earlier this year, it said.     some 45 pct of world tungsten exports come from china, but the country imports high-grade tungsten products.  reuter &#3;</h3>
