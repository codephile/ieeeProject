	<h3>the u.s. agriculture department increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the soviet union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.     in its monthly report on the soviet grain situation, the usda said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month.     usda said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising" because of recent higher soviet crop estimates.     all of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn, usda said.     of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12 mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses, usda said.     usda noted that the soviet winter grain crop suffered through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.     the severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above average winter-kill," usda said.     some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the soviet union has been actively buying grain recently.     usda said moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.  reuter &#3;</h3>
