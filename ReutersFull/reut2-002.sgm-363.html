	<h3>charles haughey, leader of the irish party fianna fail, said if he becomes prime minister following last month's irish general election, he will seek the advice of the ec commission on management of the country's 24 billion punt foreign debt.     haughey told a news conference he is confident of being asked to form a government when the irish parliament meets next tuesday. fianna fail won 81 of the 166 seats in the february 17 poll. haughey said an offer of commission help on debt management was made to him today by commission president jacques delors.     haughey said:" delors assured me we could have full recourse to the commission for advice, guidance and expert skills in dealing with our overall financial problems, particularily in the matter of debt management."     noting current debt servicing charges are about two billion punts a year, he added :"if we could achieve any significant improvement in the management and reduction in the cost of servicing, it could have significant budgetary benefits."     he added that he would seek advice, not a community loan.     however, haughey said ireland had in the past used its position within the ems to make borrowings in europe at favorable interest rates, notably for onlending to its farming sector.     "it is a mechanism which we have availed ourselves of before and we would look at it again," he said.      haughey said he regarded as "almost paramount" the maintenance of the punt's current position within the european monetary system.     he criticized the attitude of the outgoing irish government in recent ems realignments -- the punt was devalued by eight pct last august.     "until 1983, the policy of the irish government was to was to adopt a neutral stance in any realignments within the ems. i believe that policy was right," haughey said.                        reuter &#3;</h3>
