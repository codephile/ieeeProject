	<h3>the bank of thailand is seeking finance ministry approval to issue its first bond, central bank sources said.     the planned three billion baht issue would carry a term of six months to one year as a short term move to mop up surplus funds held by commercial banks.     the issue would offer a coupon attractive to commercial banks, which currently have an estimated 30 to 60 billion baht in funds invested in low-yield securities, the sources said.     the central bank, charged with supervision of commercial banks, has previously issued only finance ministry bonds.     private bankers said they are awaiting a central bank decision on whether to allow commercial banks to continue holding up to 40 pct of their capital in foreign exchange or to return it to 20 pct as scheduled.     the six month 40 pct ceiling expires april 6 but the banks want it extended for six more months.     they said a forced cut in foreign exchange positions would worsen the local liquidity problem as commercial banks would have to convert about five billion baht worth of foreign currencies in their portfolios into baht.     senior central bank officials suggested to reporters last week that the foreign exchange ceiling will be lowered to discourage banks' use of excess funds for currency speculation.     central bank sources said some commercial banks, anticipating such a central bank decision, have been converting their foreign currencies into baht this week and lending the additional funds to the bank of thailand's short-term loan repurchase facility.     they said the bank of thailand's repurchase window yesterday received offers of about three billion baht of investment funds from commercial banks, three times its normal daily amount.     the repurchase window uses government bonds as an instrument with which commercial banks can borrow from or lend to the state bank.     the facility is sometimes used by the central bank to set a local short-term interest benchmark through fixing its bond repurchase rates.  reuter &#3;</h3>
