	<h3>the united states wants taiwan's currency to appreciate faster to reduce taiwan's trade surplus with the u.s., a senior trade official said.     board of foreign trade director vincent siew told reporters on saturday u.s. officials told him in washington last week that unless taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would face retaliation.     siew returned from washington on friday after the u.s responded to taiwan's request to increase its textile export quotas by promising further talks in may. taiwan's surplus with the u.s. hit a record 13.6 billion u.s. dlrs in 1986.     washington signed a three-year accord with taipei last year limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year.     siew said the taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct against the u.s. dollar since september 1985.     it surged last week amid indications washington was seeking a major rise in its value. it rose four cents against the u.s. dollar on saturday to close at 34.59.     western trade sources told reuters taiwan and the u.s. have been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not clear how far washington wants to see the taiwan dollar rise.  reuter &#3;</h3>
