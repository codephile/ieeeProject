	<h3>the brazilian coffee institute (ibc) has given shippers until close of business on thursday to submit details of past export performance in order that individual quotas can be allocated, an ibc spokesman said.     he told reuters ibc president jorio dauster has confirmed acceptance of national coffee policy council (cnpc) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.     shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between april 1, 1985, and september 30, 1987, to be used for calculating the export performace portion.     the ibc will total all the figures, calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas, the ibc spokesman said.     he said the ibc has already settled with the sao paulo mercantile exchange how the auction system will operate. shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form.     auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations. the spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week, opening registraions from monday.     a meeting has been set for tomorrow in brasilia of the cnpc's export marketing committee to establish a system for allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels, the spokesman added.     a system of individual export quotas is being reestablished in brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure shipments are kept in line with the country's ico quota.  reuter &#3;</h3>
