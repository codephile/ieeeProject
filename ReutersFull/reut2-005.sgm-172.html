	<h3>trading bank staff in wellington and auckland voted to accept a 7.9 pct pay rise, ending any threat of strike action, the bank officers union said.     union president angela foulkes told reuters that wellington and auckland staff are still unhappy with the offer but accepted it because they could not have forced a higher offer when provincial union members had already accepted the 7.9 pct.     provincial bank staff approved the offer at meetings last week but wellington and auckland workers had initially threatened to strike in support of a higher claim.  reuter &#3;</h3>
