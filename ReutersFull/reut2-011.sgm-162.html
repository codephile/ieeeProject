	<h3>finance minister kiichi miyazawa said he regards a u.s. dollar below 150 yen as counter to the agreement struck by major nations in paris last month.     he told the upper house budget committee in parliament that japan intervened in the market when the dollar went below 150 yen, as it considered the dollar's fall below that level counter to the spirit of the paris accord.     commenting on current foreign exchange movements, miyazawa said japan would watch developments for another couple of days.     institutional investors appeared to have sold dollars to hedge currency risks ahead of the end of the financial year today, miyazawa said.     behind the recent dollar fall lies the market perception that major nations were not doing enough to implement their policies under the paris pact, he said, noting that passage of japan's 1987/88 budget has been delayed.     he said that now was the time for major nations to act under the paris accord. the u.s., west germany, france, switzerland and britain have intervened on their own account to prop up the dollar, he said. this was a concerted action.  reuter &#3;</h3>
