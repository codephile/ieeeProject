	<h3>china is negotiating with pakistan to buy 5,000 tonnes of cotton this year, after importing the same amount last year under a barter agreement, chinese consulate sources said.     chinese ambassador tian ding told a meeting of pakistani industrialists on thursday that china intended to increase imports from pakistan to reduce a trade imbalance.     pakistani officials estimate the country's cotton output from the current crop at a record 7.6 mln bales (375 pounds each). last year's output totalled 7.2 mln bales and domestic consumption was just below three mln bales, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
