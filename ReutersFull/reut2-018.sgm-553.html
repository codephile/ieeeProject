	<h3>three u.s. senators said they will propose a temporary ban on imports of all toshiba products due to the company's illegal sales of sensitive high-technology goods to the soviet union.     senator jake garn, john heinz and richard selby said at a hearing of the senate banking committee on export control, they will offer the proposal as part of a major trade bill when it is brought before the senate this summer.     garn, a utah republican, said "i am talking about specific retribution on a company that endangers the security of their own country and ours."  reuter &#3;</h3>
