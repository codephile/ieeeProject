	<h3>the reserve bank said at 1230 local time it was offering to buy short-dated government securities in the short-term money market.     the bank's action followed its purchase of short-dated government stock and six-day repurchase agreements earlier in the session.     money market traders said the move was aimed at easing cash market interest rates which had risen on demand for funds to meet paye tax and treasury note settlement commitments.  reuter &#3;</h3>
