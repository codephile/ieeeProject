	<h3>continental corp said the fresh start provision of the tax reform act of 1986 may add 1.30 to 1.60 to 1987 earnings per share.     the insurance holding company had net earnings of 449.6 mln dlrs, or, or 7.42 per share, in 1986.     john loynes, continental chief financial officer, said the fresh start provision allowed the company to discount opening tax reserves to january 1, 1987, which released deferred taxes into earnings.     loynes said the provision's potential benefit would decline gradually over the next four years, during which time continental will pay 250 mln to 350 mln dlrs more in taxes.     loynes added, however, the higher taxes are not expecetd to have a significant impact on earnings.  reuter &#3;</h3>
