	<h3>the bank of england said it invited an early round of bill offers from discount houses after forecasting a shortage in the system of some 1.05 billion stg.     among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and treasury bill take-up will drain some 1.07 billion stg while exchequer transactions will take out around 335 mln stg and bankers' balances below target five mln stg.     partly offseting these outflows, a fall in note circulation will add some 355 mln stg to the system today.  reuter &#3;</h3>
