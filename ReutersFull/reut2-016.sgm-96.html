	<h3>uganda's coffee marketing board (cmb) has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.     the board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain, the sources added.     hundreds of ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the cmb, which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the kenyan port of mombasa.     foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of uganda's hard currency earnings from coffee exports, the government newspaper new vision said.     the banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and president yoweri museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added.     banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion.     the cmb has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in kampala awaiting shipment.     the crop accounts for over 90 pct of uganda's export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.     cmb officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas, uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending september 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.  reuter &#3;</h3>
