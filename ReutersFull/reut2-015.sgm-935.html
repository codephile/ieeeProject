	<h3>diana corp said it organized the stockholders protective committee of freedom federal savings bank to nominate two candidates for election to the freedom board at the april 20 annual meeting.     it said the committee's nominees, richard fisher, diana chairman and harold sampson, a diana director, will oppose nominees of the present board of directors.     diana, which is 60 pct owned by farm house foods corp <fhfc>, owns 105,554 shares of freedom federal common stock.     diana noted that freedom federal's board recently declared a distribution of preferred stock purchase rights "with the aid of which such directors might disapprove, and perhaps prevent, possible acquisition offers or substantial stock accumulations, regardless of how beneficial they might be to the stockholders."     the company said "we want to increase the responsiveness of the (freedom federal) board to stockholder concerns."  reuter &#3;</h3>
