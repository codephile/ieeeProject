	<h3>gold bullion was fixed this morning at 419.80 dlrs an ounce, down on last night's close of 421.50/422.00, dealers said.     the market opened little changed at 421.90/422.40 but eased during the morning as dealers traded on the gold/silver ratio, selling gold and buying silver.     business was fairly light as trading in gold was overshadowed by interest in silver.     platinum was fixed this morning at 565.75 dlrs, slightly up on last night's close of 564.50/565.50.  reuter &#3;</h3>
