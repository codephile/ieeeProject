	<h3>the federal reserve may intervene in the government securities market to add reserves today, some economists said, although others felt that the fed was likely to refrain from any action.     those who believed the fed will intervene said it would probably add temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements.     but others noted the fed's current add-need is not large. they also expected the federal funds rate to edge lower.     fed funds, which averaged 6.21 pct on monday, opened at 6-1/8 pct and remained at that level in early trading.  reuter &#3;</h3>
