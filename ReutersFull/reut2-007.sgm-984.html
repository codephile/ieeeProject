	<h3>lac minerals ltd said it will suspend underground mining and exploration at its lake shore mine at kirkland lake, ontario, on april 30, pending results of a surface exploration drilling program.     lac said it does not expect the decision to affect earnings, but 44 employees will be affected.     the company said it has completed mining the crown pillar which has produced 71,000 ounces of gold since 1983. in 1986, the mine produced 10,600 ounces. lac said it will continue surface drilling in 1987 to determine if further underground exploration work is warranted.      reuter &#3;</h3>
