	<h3>the securities industry association, sia, has asked the u.s. supreme court to overturn a lower-court ruling that would allow banks to sell commercial paper, sia general counsel william fitzpatrick said.     in a petition, the sia said the court of appeals erred in upholding the decision of the federal reserve board of governors to permit bankers trust new york corp <bt> to underwrite and distribute commercial paper.     the sia charged that the fed's ruling violates the 1933 glass-steagall act barring banks from underwriting most types of securities.     the court of appeals decision, issued last december, reversed an earlier district court ruling that selling commercial paper is an improper bank activity and that private placements by banks is also improper.     in an earlier round of the case, decided in 1984, the supreme court upheld the sia's contention that commercial paper is a security for the purposes of th glass-steagall act.     the sia is a trade association representing the interests of more than 500 u.s. investment banks and securities firms.  reuter &#3;</h3>
