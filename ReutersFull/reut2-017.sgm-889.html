	<h3>western bickering over food surpluses is obscuring the fact that starvation is now a bigger problem than ever before, a senior world food council official said.     alain vidal naquet, head of external relations for the council, told a news conference that a meeting organised by the united nations body in peking next week would try to force governments to take a more serious attitude to the food crisis.     "the world is facing two crises -- poverty in developing countries and paradoxically an overflow of food surpluses in the northern part of the world," naquet said.     "this is affecting dangerously the balance of the international economy," naquet said.     he said it was ironic that the leaders of the western world would discuss food over-production during the summit in venice next week at the same time as the peking meeting would be discussing food shortages.     "hunger is not a problem kept in mind by governments. the urgency of the problem is hidden by the (food surplus and trade) problems of the rich countries," he said. "there are more people today in the world lacking enough food than there were in 1974 (the year of the world food conference in rome)."      progress has been made in some parts of the world, especially asia, but naquet said that increasing food production and aid from the developed world were not in themselves the answer to the world food problem.     he said developing countries should not rely entirely on aid from developed countries and should increase cooperation amongst themselves to increase local food production and improve distribution of existing food stocks.     more than 30 government ministers are expected to attend the peking meeting, including delegations from third world countries, the u.s., the soviet union and europe.  reuter &#3;</h3>
