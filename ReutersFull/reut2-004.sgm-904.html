	<h3>grain traders and analysts look for a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the usda's conservation reserve program, scheduled to be announced after 1400 cst today.     the usda probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted, they said.     total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week.     however, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers. also, acres set-aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total corn production will be minimal, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
