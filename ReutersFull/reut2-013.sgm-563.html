	<h3>the dollar was steady near lower opening levels in extremely quiet trading and dealers did not expect the u.s. currency to move significantly before the series of high-level monetary meetings starting today in washington.     sterling trading was equally quiet.     bullishness on the back of two new opinion polls suggesting britain's ruling conservative party had increased its lead over the opposition was checked by fears of fresh sterling-selling intervention by the bank of england, dealers said.     the dollar fetched 1.8215/25 marks at midsession against 1.8195/8205 at the opening and 1.8245/55 in europe last night.     the dollar was quoted at 145.10/20 yen, virtually unchanged from its opening 145.05/15 but sharply below yesterday's european closing 146.00/10.     it briefly dipped below 145 yen, to a quoted low of 144.85, but recovered later to trade quietly around opening levels, dealers said.     trade-weighted, sterling stood at 72.3 pct of its 1975 value, unchanged form the opening but one basis point below yesterday's close. the pound fetched 2.9480/9520 marks and 1.6190/6200 dlrs at midsession after its opening 2.9540/75 and 1.6213/23, and yesterday's closing 2.9490/9530 and 1.6163/73.     dealers said dollar business had virtually halted in europe after a large selloff against the yen in the far east, which sustained bank of japan intervention failed to stem earlier today.     they said that in the absence of other factors, participants awaited the outcome of the informal talks of group of five finance ministers and central bankers in washington today, and group of seven monetary talks tomorrow.     most dealers expected the meetings to produce little more than a vaguely worded statement to reaffirm shared objectives of stable currency markets and economic policy coordination.     the group of five and canada agreed in paris on february 22 to call a halt to the dollar's sharp decline, and several participant central banks have since intervened to keep currencies within narrow ranges against each other.     but a flare-up of the long-standing trade frictions between the u.s. and japan last month encouraged markets to test the agreement, pushing the dollar sharply lower against the yen.     dealers said that short of a convincing undertaking by japan at the washington talks to step up efforts to reduce trade surpluses and stimulate domestic demand, the dollar would resume its fall, especially against the yen.     without agreement on the trade issue, the dollar appears set to test support levels at 143 yen in the very short term, with 140 yen within reach over the next few weeks, dealers said.     some dealers said japan appears ready to compromise with the u.s. on economic policy issues.     expectations were rising of a further half-point cut in the japanese discount rate and japan's ruling liberal democratic party today announced an outline agreement on economic reflation which includes a 5,000 billion yen additional budget for 1987, the dealers said.     some dealers said the market could get some impetus from u.s. federal reserve chairman paul volcker when he testifies on third world debt problems before the senate banking committee later today.     dealers said sterling remained firm amid growing confidence the ruling conservative party is assured of victory in an election which they said would likely be called for june.     one poll out today showed the conservatives leading with 43 pct support against labour's 30 pct and the liberal-social democratic alliance at 26 pct. another poll forecast a conserative majority of 92 seats in a new parliament.     but wariness of bank of england sterling-selling intervention made participants cautious about pushing the pound much higher, dealers said.     some dealers said the bank of england was believed to have intervened on a small scale yesterday but others said they had not detected such action. no polled dealer said he had sighted bank intervention today.     the dollar was quoted at 1.5110/20 swiss francs at midsession against 1.5130/40 at the opening and a 1.5180/90 european close. it fetched 6.0575/0625 french francs against 6.0525/75 at the opening and 6.0660/0710 at close.  reuter &#3;</h3>
