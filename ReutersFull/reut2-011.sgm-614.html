	<h3>laurence a. tisch said cbs inc is a stronger company now than when he took control six months ago.     tisch, in a speech before the national association of broadcasters, said his cost-cutting efforts have made cbs a "better-managed company, with a stronger financial base, that is better prepared to deal with the challenges of the future."     tisch has been criticized for his aggressive attempts to slash cbs' costs, especially at the company's network news division.     earlier this month he ordered up to 200 jobs trimmed from cbs news, which he hopes will save at least 30 mln dlrs.     in his speech, tisch said, "while this has been an extremely painful period at cbs and particularly for the individuals whose jobs have been eliminated, it has been necessary to deal with the changing economics of our business."     he added, "we have had to establish a realistic cost structure and assert firm control over our expenses."     he said the cost cutting has not compromised the quality of cbs programming or the creativity and professionalism of its staff.     tisch also said he remains "firmly committed to ensuring that our crown jewel - the cbs news division - maintains its position as the premier source of television news in america."  reuter &#3;</h3>
