	<h3>dealers said very little business was done in local oilseeds markets.     coconut oil was nominally 18 cents a lb for april/may shipment, cif, new york/gulf, brokers said.     crude wet-milled corn oil, fob, midwest points, was nominally 20-3/4 cents a lb for nearby shipment. based on that price, dealers said refined corn oil, fob, new york, was nominally 27.15 cents a lb.     peanut oil remained offered at 24-1/2 cents a lb for nearby shipment but dealers said market interest was closer to 24 cents.  reuter &#3;</h3>
