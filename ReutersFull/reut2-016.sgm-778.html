	<h3>the bank of japan said it forecast japan's broadly-defined m-2 money supply average plus certificates of deposit (cds) will rise by about nine pct in the current april-june quarter against 8.5 pct a year earlier.     unadjusted m-2 plus cds rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in january/march 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year earlier, it said.     the bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift to private banks from the bank of japan of 400-1,000 billion yen by the recently privatised japanese railways.  reuter  &#3;</h3>
