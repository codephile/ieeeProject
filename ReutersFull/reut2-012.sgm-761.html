	<h3>u.k. domestic wheat markets dropped about one stg per tonne early this morning following overnight news that the ec is releasing a further 300,000 tonnes of wheat from british intervention stores for the home market over a three month period.     april deliveries of denaturable wheat were offered in east anglia at 124 stg and may at 125 stg per tonne, both one stg down on yesterday's traded rates.     the market is expecting u.k. wheat futures to show a similar loss at today's opening.  reuter &#3;</h3>
