	<h3>karl otto poehl is likely to be re-elected president of the bundesbank when his current term in office expires at the end of this year, government sources said.     they were commenting on a report in der spiegel news magazine which said chancellor helmut kohl had decided to keep poehl in office for another eight years.     government spokesman friedhelm ost had no comment on the report, other than to say that the subject of the bundesbank presidency was not currently under discussion. der spiegel said that, because poehl is a member of the social democratic party (spd), kohl had not taken the decision lightly.     poehl has been bundesbank chief since january 1, 1980, while kohl's conservative/liberal coalition has held power since 1982. der spiegel said kohl would have preferred to offer the post to a member of his christian democratic union (cdu).  reuter &#3;</h3>
