	<h3>the bank of england said it forecast a shortage of around 400 mln stg in the money market today.     among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.085 billion stg.     partly offsetting these outflows, a fall in note circulation will add some 340 mln stg, exchequer transactions around 300 mln and bankers' balances above target about 50 mln.  reuter &#3;</h3>
