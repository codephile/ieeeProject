	<h3>the world bank is prepared to play a more aggressive role in promoting third world development and easing the debt crisis, bank president barber conable said.     "we must be realistic about the immediate prospects for an expansion in voluntary commercial bank lending, with the world bank playing an even more vigorous role in the debt crisis," conable said in an interview with newsweek magazine.     conable said the bank must step in to help relieve the debt crisis, which has prompted a number of u.s. commercial banks to write off a portion of their third world loans.     "our plans include initiatives on the debt front, as well as greater emphasis on debt-equity swaps and the promotion of private investment in third world countries through our affiliate, the international finance corporation," conable said. "the bank is primarily a development institution, not a debt-management agency. but debt must be managed effectively or it hampers development."     conable defended his reorganisation plan for the bank, which he said was aimed at improving efficiency and limiting bureaucracy. he added environmental considerations would play a larger role in the evaluation of proposed projects.  reuter &#3;</h3>
