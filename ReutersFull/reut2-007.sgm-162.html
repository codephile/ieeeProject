	<h3>repligen corp said it intends to file an investigational new drug application to the food and drug administration seeking permission to test its aids vaccine in humans by the early summer.     repligen said the human tests could begin by the end of the year.     "we are sufficiently encouraged and impressed by the work to date to go ahead with a clinical trial," said michael egan, manager of business development for repligen, a biotechnology company.     repligen's egan said the vaccine contains a subfragment of the protein coat of the aids virus. in animal tests, which included primates, egan said the vaccine provoked neutralizing antibodies to the aids virus and broader cellular immunity.     egan said the approach repligen is using to deliver its vaccine, using standard vaccine methods, may be safer than vaccines using a live smallpox virus to carry proteins found on the surface coat of the aids virus.     yesterday, bristol-myers co <bmy> said it would seek regulatory permission to test its aids vaccine, which uses a smallpox virus, in humans by the end of the month.     repligen's aids vaccine is a collaborative effort of the company, centocor inc <cnto>, duke university medical school and the national cancer insitutes. the research teams are directed by john ghrayeb of centocor, scott putney of repligen, dani bolognesi at duke and robert gallo and flossie wong-staal at the national cancer institute.     although there are several aids vaccine candidates, experts believe that development of a safe and effective vaccine is a long ways away. moreover, seeking approval to test a vaccine is only the first step in a long process of verifying if the vaccine actually will prevent infection.   reuter &#3;</h3>
