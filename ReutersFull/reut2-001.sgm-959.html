	<h3>the nine creditor banks of the singapore coffee trader <teck hock and co (pte) ltd> are thinking of buying a controlling stake in the company themselves, a creditor bank official said.     since last december the banks have been allowing the company to postpone loan repayments while they try to find an overseas commodity company to make an offer for the firm.     at least one company has expressed interest and negotiations are not yet over, banking sources said.     however, the banks are now prepared to consider taking the stake if they find an investor willing to inject six to seven mln dlrs in the company but not take control, the banking sources said.     teck hock's financial adviser, singapore international merchant bankers ltd (simbl), will work on the new proposal with the creditor banks, they said.     major holdings are likely to be held by the two largest creditor banks, standard chartered bank <stch.l> and oversea-chinese banking corp ltd <ocbm.si>, they added.     teck hock owes over 100 mln singapore dlrs and the creditor banks earlier this week agreed to let teck hock fufill profitable contracts to help balance earlier losses.     the nine banks are oversea-chinese banking corp ltd, united overseas bank ltd <uobm.si>, <banque paribas>, <bangkok bank ltd,> <citibank na>, standard chartered bank ltd, algemene bank nederland nv <abnn.as>, banque nationale de paris <bnpp.pa> and <chase manhattan bank na.>  reuter &#3;</h3>
