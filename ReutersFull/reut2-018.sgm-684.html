	<h3>federated department stores inc's foley's unit said it will consolidate dallas distribution center operations, reducing the number of buildings to one from three and cutting staff to 125 from 300.     the company said most of the hourly employees affected by the staff reduction will be offered comparable jobs at its houston distribution center, and those who cannot relocate will be considered for available position at foley's dallas/fort worth area stores.     the company said "the overhead costs and inefficiencies associated with operating two complete distribution networks in both cities make it economically unfeasible."  the consolidation follows the merger of foley's and sanger harris in january.  reuter &#3;</h3>
