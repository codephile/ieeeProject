	<h3>u.s. and japanese officials meet tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs president reagan has ordered imposed on japanese exports.     but u.s. officials held out little hope that any accord could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from about five per cent - are to take effect on april 17.     the customs bureau last week started to levy a bond on the japanese goods that reagan ordered penalized. the penalties would be retroactive to march 31.     reagan said on march 27 when ordering the tariffs that he hoped the japanese would soon end their unfair practices in semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted.     technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow, with meetings at a more senior level scheduled for thursday and friday. public hearings on the sanctions are set for april 13.     the japanese aides here for the technical talks include shigeru muraoka, director-general of international trade policy of the ministry of international trade and industry (miti), and masashi yamamoto, deputy director-general of the information and machinery bureau.     meeting with them will glen fukushima, director of the japan office of the u.s. trade representative's office, and jim gradoville, of trade representative's office of industry and services.     the two sides in the thursday and friday talks will be headed by deputy u.s. trade representative michael smith and miti vice minister makoto kuroda.      reuter &#3;</h3>
