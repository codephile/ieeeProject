	<h3>a solution to brazil's debt problems is unthinkable without the involvement of the international monetary fund, juergen sarrazin, management board member of dresdner bank ag responsible for latin america said.     sarrazin told the business daily handelsblatt that brazil's interest payments moratorium had cost it the goodwill of many banks.     "now there will certainly be no solutions without the imf," he said. "alternatives which could be imagined before, such as bringing the imf in with us in a loose form, are over," he said.     sarrazin, who through dresdner represents german banks in several rescheduling coordinating committees, noted that brazil was still prepared to negotiate.     but he said work in the coordinating committees had already run into difficulties before brazil's interest moratorium.     justified calls by debtors for more flexibility from the banks were blocked because u.s. regulations made solutions such as capitalising of interest virtually impossible, he said.     although many european banks were opposed to the use of interest capitalisation, "this was an alternative which has to be brought in," sarrazin said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
