	<h3>french finance minister edouard balladur said the agenda of state privatisations may not be done at full speed if market conditions prove unsuitable.     "i'm not going to privatise at full speed if market conditions do not permit. that would be absurd," he told journalists. "what we're going to do is adapt our program very closely to the evolution of our stock markets."     french stock prices fell more than 10 pct on monday, a 6-1/2 year record, as concern deepened that interest rates worldwide would surge and choke off fragile economic growth, dealers said. stock of several privatised firms fell below their issue price.  reuter &#3;</h3>
