	<h3>brazilian officials are privately expressing concern that the change of command at the federal reserve may lead to a tougher u.s. policy on debt and less understanding of the problems of the third world.     paul volcker, head of the federal reserve, was considered here to be understanding of brazil's difficulties.     a finance ministry source said of his colleagues in the ministry: "they are a bit apprehensive about (alan) greenspan (who will replace volcker), considering his reputation as a very tough man, an advocate of recessive measures to counter-attack inflation. there is a little bit of concern."  reuter &#3;</h3>
