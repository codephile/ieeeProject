	<h3>the bank of france is to inject liquidity against first category paper at a tender this afternoon, a bank spokesman said.     money market sources were divided as to whether they thought the bank of france would use the occasion to cut its intervention rate, which has stood at 7 3/4 pct since it was cut from eight pct on march 9.     some thought a rate cut unlikely given foreign exchange turbulence and the u.s. prime rate rise to 7 3/4 pct, while others still counted on a 1/4 point cut by the bank of france.  reuter &#3;</h3>
