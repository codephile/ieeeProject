	<h3>mario branco peres, president of the brazilian association of citrus juice industries (abrassuco), welcomed a decision by the u.s. commerce department sharply cutting its duties on imported frozen concentrated orange juice (fcoj) from brazil.     speaking by telephone from sao paulo, peres said, "with its decision, the u.s. government recognised the honesty of brazilian exporters, who never have the intention of practising dumping."     in a final ruling yesterday, the u.s. government eliminated the duties shipped by sucocitrico cutrale and cut to 1.96 pct the duty on citrosuco. duties of 8.54 pct had been set last october.     peres said brazil had enough orange juice to meet the needs of its major clients.     "we do not have in stock what we would like to have, but we certainly have enough orange juice available to supply our buyers," peres said, declining to estimate the amount of the current stock. "to keep it a secret is part of our strategy," he added.     peres said the price policy of the orange juice was based on market conditions.     "there is nothing better than a free trade policy," he said.     cutrale and citrosuco officials were not immediately available for comment.  reuter &#3;</h3>
