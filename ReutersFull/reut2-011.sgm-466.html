	<h3>white house budget chief james miller told the house appropriations committee the reagan administration has "serious objections" to a supplemental spending bill for the current fiscal year that is about to come to a house vote.     miller said the bill, which as written by the appropriations committee, would approve 2.7 billion dlrs in additional 1987 spending, cut defense too harshly and gave too much to domestic programs.     the administration had only asked for an additional 1.1 billion dlrs in 1987 spending.  reuter &#3;</h3>
