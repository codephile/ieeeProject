	<h3>the bank of spain suspended its daily money market assistance and offered to drain funds with three- and seven-day repurchase agreements at 12-1/2 pct, money market sources said.     the sources said the measures were a further attempt to rein in money supply and were likely to force some institutions to scramble for funds before the 10-day accounting period for reserve requirements closes on monday.     the bank, which raised its rate for ordinary overnight assistance to 13-3/4 from 13-1/2 pct on wednesday, opened its special borrowing facility for overnight funds at 14-1/2 pct.     money market sources said institutions in need of funds were likely to have to return to the bank tomorrow for further assistance.     the bank rarely invites applications for ordinary assistance on a saturday and the sources said it was more likely to open its special borrowing facility again.  reuter &#3;</h3>
