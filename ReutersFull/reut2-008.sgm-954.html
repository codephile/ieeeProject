	<h3>president reagan signed a bill limiting fees that may be charged by the government national mortgage association (gnma) for its guarantees of privately issued mortgage-backed securities but voiced serious reservations about the measure.     he said the bill's provision barring gnma from increasing its current fee of .06 pct charged to issuers of single-family mortgage backed securities "is an unnecessary and risky congressional intrusion into gnma's ability to respond quickly and flexibly to changes in financial markets."     reagan said his reservations "must be addressed promptly through remedial amendments."     reagan said the provision hampered gnma's ability to maintain reserves necessary to meet its obligations, "particularly in light of a disturbing increase in claims and in gnma's contingent liabilities."     reagan said the legislative cap on fees "could well call into question the adequacy of gnma's  current reserve of 1.4 billion dlrs, given the 250 billion in gnma-guaranteed securities presently outstanding and gnma's monthly contingent liability of three billion dlrs."     reagan said he had instructed housing secretary samuel pierce to work with congress to draft revisions to the legislation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
