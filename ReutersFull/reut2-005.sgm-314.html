	<h3>indonesia has imported palm oil this year and is likely to take more, trade sources said.     they were commenting on a weekend jakarta report quoting a ministry of trade spokesman as saying indonesia had not issued licences to import the commodity. he also said there was no sign of a shortage of palm oil in indonesia.     a major palm oil dealer said he shipped malaysian palm oil to indonesia in february, additional vessels were loading this month and other vessels had been earmarked for april.     other operators claimed they had palm oil booked for indonesia but would not disclose tonnages.     traders said palm oil production in indonesia this year had been below expectations and current stocks were low. they said licences were issued at the start of the year to import crude palm oil but were subsequently revised to include rbd olein and rbd oil.     last week there were rumours in european markets that indonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil for deliveries commencing april. an indonesian ministry of trade official said this was incorrect.     some traders here said the total could be more. others said they could include those issued earlier this year and applications not yet granted.  reuter &#3;</h3>
