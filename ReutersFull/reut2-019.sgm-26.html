	<h3>the ruling brazilian democratic movement party (pmdb) will hold a national convention on july 18 and 19 to discuss the length of the presidential term, a pmdb spokesman said.     although the country's constitution allows for a six-year term, sarney said he would remain only five years after he came to power in 1984.     the constituent assembly is drawing up a new constitution and severe economic problems have increased the pressure on it to call early elections. a faction of the pmdb favours a poll in november next year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
