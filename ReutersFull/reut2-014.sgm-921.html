	<h3>good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in the mackay-burdekin region of queensland's central coast, an australian sugar producers' association spokesman said.     as previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since december, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season.     mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from brisbane.     although the mackay-burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. but is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.     elsewhere, in far north queensland, the bundaberg region and southern queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.     initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of may, he said.     the cane crush normally runs from june to december.  reuter &#3;</h3>
