	<h3>lukens inc said its backlog at the end of february was about 140 mln dlrs, up from 104 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 and more than 50 pct above the february 1986 level.     the company said "based upon the current backlog, we are reasonably confident that sales in the first two quarters will be stronger than sales in the same two quarters last year. earnings from operations should also be better."  lukens earned 456,000 dlrs in last year's first quarter and 2,500,000 dlrs in the second quarter, excluding a pension gain and a litigation provision in that period.     lukens had first quarter sales last year of 92.9 mln dlrs and second quarter sales of 105.9 mln dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
