	<h3>democrats rammed through the house budget committee a trillion dollar u.s. spending budget for 1988 over republican protests.     after a brief partisan debate in which republicans said they were kept in the dark about the plan, the committee approved the budget by voice vote and sent it to the full house.      it was the first major congressional action on a u.s. budget for the government year starting october 1 this year.     president reagan has had his own budget virtually ignored by democrats and fellow republicans alike.     the house budget would cut the deficit about 38 billion dlrs off an estimated 171-billion-dlr deficit for a 133- billion-dlr deficit, using congressional budget office estimates.     using president reagan's more optimistic economic assumptions, committee democrats said the deficit would be 107 billion -- the goal of a new budget law designed to gradually end deficits by 1991.     the estimated deficit for this year is about 175 billion dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
