	<h3>american federal savings and loans association of colorado said its earnings will continue to be under pressure this year due to the weakness of the colorado economy.     the company, which today declared a regular quarterly dividend, said it was also under pressure from the level of non-earning assets it holds.     the company said this pressure will be offset to a certain extent by increased revenues from out-of-state operations and its strong capital position.  reuter &#3;</h3>
