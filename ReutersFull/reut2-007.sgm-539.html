	<h3>japanese customs, faced with a flood of fake reebok sneakers from south korea, have turned away some 100,000 pairs since last summer, rebook officials said.     a ministry of finance spokesman said officials at the ports of tokyo, osaka, yokohama and kobe had begun barring counterfeit footwear but declined to say how many pairs.     a spokesman for reebok japan, the local subsidiary of reebok international <rbk> of avon, massachussetts, said the firm had complained of the influx to the ministry last july.     "they use our trademark and everything. and it's easy to fake our trademark," the reebok spokesman said.     he said customs had sent back some 100,000 pairs to south korea, but the finance ministry declined to confirm this.     "because of various reasons, we cannot say how many pairs have been turned away," the ministry spokesman said.     the reebok spokesman said an unspecified number of fake reeboks have made it into the country, and were being sold at cut-rate prices in tokyo and osaka stores.     "they go for about 20 to 30 pct less than the price of genuine reeboks," the spokesman said. a pair of real reeboks sells for about 10,000 yen in japan.     the government last summer warned stores not to carry the shoes and reebok has sued two for continuing to sell them, he said. no action has been taken against the south korean manufacturers, he said.     reebok has also found counterfeits from taiwan and the philippines aimed at the u.s. market and fakes from spain targetted at european markets, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
