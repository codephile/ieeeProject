	<h3>the navy is unloading foodgrains at chittagong port following a strike by nearly 1,000 dockworkers, bangladesh shipping corp officials said.     the navy was unloading 74,000 tonnes of foodgrains from two ships today, and four vessels laden with some 90,000 tonnes of grains were waiting at the outer anchorage, port officials said.     a spokesman for the workers said they would continue their strike until authorities agree to their demands for higher pay and other benefits. the strike began on june 11.     "unloading of grains and other essential commodities started normally after we called in navy personnel to help," a port official told reuters.     "the strike has caused no serious dislocation," he said.     the government meanwhile declared the port jobs an "essential service" and said the strikers could be dismissed unless they end the strike soon.  reuter &#3;</h3>
