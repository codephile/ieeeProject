	<h3>police and security forces entered the golden temple in amritsar after six people including four policemen were wounded in a shooting incident in the complex, police said.     police in chandigarh, capital of punjab state, said about 300 men entered the complex after a party of plainclothes police were fired on, apparently by extremists campaigning for a separate sikh homeland.     it was the first time uniformed police had entered sikhdom's holiest shrine since last june when extremists stabbed a temple guard to death.  reuter &#3;</h3>
