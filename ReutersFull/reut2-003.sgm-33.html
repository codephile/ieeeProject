	<h3>uganda, africa's second largest coffee producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee talks in london, the chairman of the state-run coffee marketing board, cmb, said.     "this has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of robusta coffee," j. makumbi said when he returned from london on friday.     producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world's coffee production during international coffee organisation, ico, talks that ended last week.     makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were suspended in feburary last year, on indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically.     uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ico quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the cmb.     the cmb has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986/87 october-september season to over three mln bags.     for several years uganda had been unable to meet its ico export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.     the ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs over half of salaried manpower.     in dar es salaam, tanzania's agriculture and livestock development minister paul bomani said today third world countries would suffer from the failure of the london coffee talks.     "it is only the middlemen who will benefit, he said.     bomani called on the ico to convene another meeting within two months, saying, "once tempers have cooled and delegations have had time to report back to their headquarters, common sense will prevail."  reuter &#3;</h3>
