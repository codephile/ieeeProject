	<h3>colombia has secured total borrowings this year for 1.95 billion dlrs, of which 1.40 billion correspond to loans arranged before 1986, director of public credit mauricio cabrera said.     cabrera said about half of the borrowings would come from the world bank and the inter-american development bank.     he was speaking at a forum for industrialists upon his return from london where he attended the signing of a 50 mln dlr floating rate note, colombia's first such offering on the euromarket.     cabrera reaffirmed that colombia has no intention of rescheduling  its foreign debt, which he put at 14.35 billion dlrs, of which 11.35 billion are from the public sector.     for the international banking community, colombia continues to be "the best house in spite of being in the worst neighbourhood," he said.     he said debt servicing will remain a burden in 1987 and will amount to 34.6 pct of total exports.  reuter &#3;</h3>
