	<h3><billiton international metals b.v.>, the dutch mining company, has urged surinam to change policies it says are causing heavy losses on bauxite mining operations there, a company spokesman said.     he told reuters that billiton, a fully-owned royal dutch/shell <rd.as> subsidiary, presented the demands to henk heidweiler, a top aide to surinam military leader desi bouterse, who visited the netherlands last week for official talks.     billiton and <suralco>, owned by u.s. conglomerate alcoa <aa.s>, both want devaluation, and lower wages, welfare contributions, taxes on bauxite and energy prices.     the two firms are the biggest private sector employers in surinam. billiton also urged heidweiler to improve the safety of its employees in the campaign against a jungle guerilla group, the spokesman said, adding rebel fighting since july 1986 had depressed production at billiton and suralco plants.     high voltage cables from the power plant of afobakka have been cut, and a bauxite mine at moengo has been shut, he added.     "we are already making vast losses in surinam and you can't expect any company to remain operating with losses," the spokesman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
