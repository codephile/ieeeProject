	<h3>european community, ec, agriculture ministers struggled today to finalise new rules aimed at limiting sales into public cold stores of unwanted butter at high guaranteed ec prices, diplomats said.     the plan is the key element in a landmark accord to cut dairy output by 9.5 pct over two years agreed in outline last december after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations.     the accord, which is due to operate from the start of the new milk marketing year on april 1, was hailed as the most significant step in an on-going campaign to reform costly ec farm policies and cut embarrassing food surpluses.     diplomats say the december agreement itself is not threatened but that its effect could be considerably weakened if the proposals are altered too radically.     west germany and ireland are opposed to proposed limits on a farmer's now automatic right to sell surplus butter into public stores when market prices and stocks are high.     faced with a butter "mountain" of a record 1.2 mln tonnes costing over two mln dlrs per day just to store, ec farm commissioner frans andriessen says farmers must be encouraged to cut production to meet demand.     he is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem before the ministers move on to consider this year's annual price review which proposes extending the new system for butter sales to other sectors such as cereals.  reuter &#3;</h3>
