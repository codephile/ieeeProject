	<h3>pegasus gold inc said it cut its long term debt to 85 mln dlrs from 100 mln dlrs when its european bondholders voluntarily converted some of their debt holdings into 1.5 mln shares of pegasus common.     the company said the debt converted represents about 40 pct of the total 60 mln swiss franc convertible debentures it completed last fall.     in addition, pegasus said it began mining and processing operations at its zortman/landusky mine one month ahead of schedule.     pegasus said it completed the first phase of its 1987 super pad ahead of schedule as well, allowing the mining company to load up to 7.5 mln tons of new ore on the pad.     pegasus estimated that 1987 production at the zortman/landusky mine will be about 80,000 ounces of gold and 225,000 ounces of silver.  reuter &#3;</h3>
