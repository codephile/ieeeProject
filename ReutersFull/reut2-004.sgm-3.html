	<h3>doctors at the centers for disease control in atlanta said they have new evidence that birth control pills can help provide long-term protection from cancer of the ovary, even if the pills are only taken for a few months.      the study, reported in the new england journal of medicine, also found that all the various types of oral contraceptives on the market were equally effective in lowering the rate of ovarian cancer.      the researchers estimated that the use of birth control pills in this country probably prevented about 1,700 cases of ovarian cancer in 1982.     as more and more women who have taken oral contraceptives "move into the age groups that are at highest risk for epithelial ovarian cancer we may witness a declining incidence of this serious disease," they said.      specifically, the team led by dr. howard ory found that "oral contraceptive use, even for a few months, reduces the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer by 40 percent for women 20 to 54 years of age.      "the effect probably takes from five to ten years to become apparent, but it persists long after the use of oral contraceptives ends. moreover, protection exists regardless of the formulation of oral contraceptive used," they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
