	<h3>presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said u.s. trade sanctions against japan were likely take effect on april 17 in spite of a "full court press" by japanese officials to avoid them.     "all indications are they will take effect," he said.     "i would say japan is applying the full court press ... they certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining their position," fitzwater told reporters.     he noted high level meetings on the trade dispute are underway here but said, "i don't think there's anything i can report and i don't believe there's been any official movement."  reuter &#3;</h3>
