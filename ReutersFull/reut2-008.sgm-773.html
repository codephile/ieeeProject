	<h3>moody's investors service inc said it affirmed the ratings on 12 billion dlrs of debt of chrysler corp and its unit, chrysler financial corp.     the agency cited potential benefits of chrysler's proposed acquisition of american motors corp <amo> to its business position and marketing and distribution capabilities.     moody's said it believes the acquisition will be carried out substantially as currently structured. affirmed were chrysler's baa-1 senior debt and chrysler financial's baa-1 senior debt, baa-2 senior subordinated debt and baa-3 junior subordinated debt.     also affirmed were the prime-2 commercial paper of chrysler's finance arm and the baa-1 guaranteed eurobonds of chrysler credit canada ltd.     moody's pointed out the purchase of amc would undercut some of the recent progress chrysler has made in improving its financial condition and cost structure. the agency noted that chrysler would assume substantial debt and unfunded pension liabilities, as well as two inefficient production facilities.     but, moody's said, the negative effect on chrysler's profitability and cash flow would be temporary. meanwhile, amc's b-1 preferred stock remains under moody's review.  reuter &#3;</h3>
