	<h3>no changes have been made or are being planned in the agriculture department's calculation of price differentials between interior grain locations and the texas gulf, a senior usda official said.     ralph klopfenstein, usda deputy administrator for commodity operations, told reuters, "we do not anticipate any changes to be made" in the texas gulf differentials used to calculate posted county prices for corn.     "we do not relate the texas gulf structure with the louisiana gulf structure at all. it's a totally different situation," he said.     rumors had circulated through the market this morning that usda had widened texas gulf differentials in a similar manner to last weekend's adjustments with the louisiana gulf.  reuter &#3;</h3>
