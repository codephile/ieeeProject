	<h3>a.h. robins co, facing suits over its dalkon shield birth control device, said a federal court of appeals approved of the way the company notified potential victims about a possible liability.     the notification of potential claimants, which began in january 1986 and ended several months later, was challenged by some claimant committees who said the company's program was inadequate.     a company spokesman said a.h. robins was pleased with the ruling, noting an unfavorable decision would have "set the whole thing back for quite some time."     the ruling by the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit, which upheld a lower court, said, "the notification program used by robins was ... reasonable.     "the evidence indicates that every news outlet in the world received the information. simiarly, there is strong evidence that the news was broadly disseminated worldwide.     "women from such unlikely locations as kenya, botswana, pakistan and bangladesh ultimately filed claims. a battery of world health and welfare organizations also disseminated the information. it appears to this court that the extensive notification program was a success."  reuter &#3;</h3>
