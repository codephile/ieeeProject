	<h3>japan will carry out a government-coordinated study of uses for superconducting materials, the ministry of international trade and industry (miti) said.     university and industry representatives will start discussions in april on basic research and possible applications, masatoshi urashima, miti's director for development of future basic technology, said.     superconductors, which conduct electricity with very low resistance, could be used in computers, semiconductors and high speed trains, he said.     urashima said recent discoveries of superconductive materials which do not need extremely low temperatures led to miti's decision to coordinate research.     miti's electric technology laboratory is currently researching energy efficiency and superconductive electrical generation, he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
