	<h3>the federal reserve is expected to enter the u.s. government securities market to add temporary reserves, economists said.     they expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by arranging 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements. the fed may add the reserves directly instead via system repurchases.     federal funds, which averaged 6.18 pct yesterday, opened at 6-3/16 pct and stayed there in early trading. analysts said the rate is under upward pressure partly from settlement of 8.25 billion dlrs of five-year treasury notes.  reuter &#3;</h3>
