	<h3>the finance ministry is expected to introduce yen commercial paper, cp, from october 1 in response to growing calls from corporations, ministry sources said.     around 200 corporations satisfy financial standards set by securities houses for non-collateral straight bond issues, including electric power companies, <nippon telegraph and telephone corp> and kokusai denshin denwa co ltd, securities managers said.     most eligible firms would have to set up special reserves for cp issues called backup lines, or be guaranteed by financial institutions to protect investors, they said.     the legal status of yen cp would be the same as yen commercial bills and it would be placed by an intermediary bank or securities house, securities managers said.     the minimum issue unit will be 100 mln yen, and maturities will be from 30 days and six months, they said.     securities houses, banks, insurance companies and consumer credit companies are barred from cp issues, they said.     only banks may be commissioned to handle the clerical business of principle payments, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
