	<h3>the agricultural stabilization and conservation service announced several temporary steps to enable it to respond more quickly to the high demand for commodity credit corp.-owned soybeans.     the ccc has suspended its practice of contacting storing warehousemen before selling soybeans for cash to a third party, said collyn peterson, deputy director in the ascs kansas city office.     in addition, he said, minimum quantities for sales will be 25,000 bushels, or all of a warehouse total inventory if less than that.      ascs has added telephone lines to handle calls from those interested in buying soybeans, peterson said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
