	<h3>widespread rain interfered with summer crop harvesting in brazil's rio grande do sul and southern mato grosso do sul in the week ended march 28, the joint agricultural weather facility of the u.s. agriculture and commerce departments said.     in its international weather and crop summary, the agency said some rain fell in parana, providing beneficial moisture to immature soybeans and corn following a long hot, dry spell.     mostly dry weather prevailed in western sao paulo, southwestern minas gerais, southern goias and extreme eastern mato grosso do sul, it said.     the agency said weekly temperatures again averaged near to slightly above normal.     in general, harvest progress likely was slowed by wet field conditions over much of the region, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
