	<h3>anglo american corp of south africa ltd. <angl.j> has attacked a key apartheid law barring blacks from living in white residential areas as "racially discriminatory" and "economically wasteful."     the group areas act, was also a "misuse of resources the south african economy can no longer sustain," the directors said in the annual report released today.     these latest remarks by south africa's biggest company, follows past criticisms by the firm that apartheid was economically inefficient.      the company said the country's prospects for economic growth had improved in the past few months after two years of deep recession, but cautioned that the economic outlook was heavily dependent on a solution to south africa's political turmoil.     the directors said the resumption of sustained economic growth was dependent on stable domestic conditions and the restoration of normal international relationships.     the south african government this year is targeting three pct real growth in gross domestic product against an increase of less than one pct last year.      "a moderate rate of growth in the year ahead should not give rise to strains on the balance payments, provided there is not a substantial deterioration in export earnings or an acceleration of capital outflows," anglo american said.     anglo american last month reported a 25.8 pct advance in net attributable profit to 1.5 billion rand in the year to march 31.   reuter &#3;</h3>
