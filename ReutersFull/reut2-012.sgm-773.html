	<h3>the belgian national bank cut interest rates on one, two and three-month treasury certificates to 7.30 pct from 7.40 pct effective immediately, the bank said in a telex message.     the bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificate rates on march 23, when it also reduced rates for all three periods by 0.10 points.     a national bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would bring the rates closer in line with currently prevailing interbank interest rates.     the spokesman said it was too early to predict whether the move would herald a reduction in discount rate, which currently stands at eight pct, when the bank holds its regular weekly meeting at which the rate is discussed next wednesday.     the discount rate generally moves in tandem with the three-month treasury certificate rate. however, there is no formal link and the discount rate was not adjusted following the march 23 changes.  reuter &#3;</h3>
