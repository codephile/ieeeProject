	<h3>the reagan administration soon will propose a program of no-fault compensation for people injured by childhood vaccines, a senior treasury department counsel told the house select revenue measures subcommittee.     "within the next few weeks, we expect to propose a program that will provide equitable, no-fault compensation to injured persons, and predictable (and hence insurable) liabilities for vaccine manufacturers," dennis ross, tax legislative counsel for treasury, said in prepared testimony.     the vaccine act was signed into law last year but did not include a funding mechanism for its compensation program.     ross noted 50 to 75 children a year suffer serious long-term or injuries from adverse reactions to vaccine for diptheria, tetanus and whooping cough alone.     but he said lawsuits were causing drug companies like wyeth laboratories and parke, davis and co to stop producing childhood vaccines.     the administration would not favor funding compensation through an excise tax levied on the vaccine producers because it would add to collection and auditing burdens, ross said.     he did not suggest a favored funding mechanism but said a lump-sum trust fund for compensation might be preferable.  reuter &#3;</h3>
