	<h3>britain and west germany told their european community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the ec of its farm surpluses.     at a meeting of ec foreign ministers, britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered ec consumer groups and unleashed washington-led protests from exporters to the ec, diplomats said.     west germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit german farmers, they added.     they said west germany's objections were put in a letter this weekend from chancellor helmut kohl to jacques delors, the president of the ec's executive commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new ec cash crisis.     kohl reiterated german objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of monetary compensatory amounts (mcas) - a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.     kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit german farmers who, without mcas, would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all other 11 ec states, diplomats said.     britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage ec trade relations.     the diplomats said the united states had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it as a breach of the ec's obligations under the world trade body gatt.     but protests had also come from other exporters to the ec, such as senegal, malaysia, indonesia, brazil, argentina, iceland and norway, they added.     britain has often lined up against west germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the u.s.     foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the mca proposals today, diplomats said. but their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by ec farm ministers later this month, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
