	<h3>about 2,000 sugar cane planters marched to port-au-prince to protest against the closure of haiti's largest sugar mill and second biggest employer.     the haitian american sugar company closed on friday because of a huge surplus of unsold sugar. the firm said haiti has been flooded with smuggled refined and unrefined sugar from the dominican republic and refined u.s. sugar from miami.     the closure idled 3,500 factory workers and left 30,000 small cane planters with no outlet for their cane. the protesters blamed finance minister lesly delatour for the closure, saying his policies have hurt haitian businesses.  reuter &#3;</h3>
