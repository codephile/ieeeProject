	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it affirmed banner industries inc's 135 mln dlrs of b-minus subordinated debt following its purchase of rexnord inc.      rexnord's 50 mln dlrs of 12-3/4 pct debentures of 1994 were cut to b from a-minus to reflect the merger with banner.     while increasing banner's size and diversity, s and p said the transaction heightens financial risk, with debt to capital rising to more than 90 pct.     near-term earnings and cash flow protection will weaken from the acquisition, though banner's plans to sell some rexnord assets will reduce debt for the medium term.  reuter &#3;</h3>
