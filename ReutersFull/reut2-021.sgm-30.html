	<h3>president reagan said the commerce department should be vigilant in preventing the flow of strategic technology from reaching the the soviet union and other communist countries.     he was speaking at the swearing in of c. william verity as secretary of the commerce department.     verity said the u.s. should make certain that militarily sensitive high technology does not wind up in communist nations. but he also said the u.s. must reduce the list of products of a nontechnological nature, thereby allowing manufacturers to increase exports and jobs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
