	<h3>thousands of british columbian unionized workers staged a one-day general strike to protest proposed new provincial labor legislation.     ferry service was halted, there was no garbage collection, government offices were closed and some medical services were restricted. postal workers, although covered by federal laws, refused to cross picket lines.     in vancouver, transit workers also joined in the protest and no buses operated. management, however, kept the city's skytrain service in operation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
