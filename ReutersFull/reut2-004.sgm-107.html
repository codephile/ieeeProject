	<h3>ibm deutschland gmbh <ibm.f>, the west german subsidiary of international business machines corp <ibm.n>, said its turnover fell nine pct to 12.0 billion marks in 1986 as a result of currency factors, weaker demand in the second half and stiff price competition.     ibm deutschland planned to strengthen its software and service activities in future to ensure growth remained at desired levels in the medium term, managing board chairman hans-olaf henkel said. he gave no 1986 profit figures.     domestic turnover fell 12.7 pct to 7.2 billion marks while exports declined 3.2 pct to 4.8 billion.     most of ibm deutschland's exports go to ibm companies in other countries.     henkel said volume sales had been positive overall, especially in the large computer and personal computer sectors. however, at the same time, fierce international competition, worldwide overcapacity and currency movements had reduced large computer prices for ibm deutschland by some 23 pct.     in january henkel said the annual growth rate of the german computer market may in the long term be less than 10 pct, well below the 20 pct expansion originally forecast.  reuter &#3;</h3>
