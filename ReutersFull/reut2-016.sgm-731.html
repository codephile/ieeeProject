	<h3>the latest british opinion poll gave margaret thatcher's conservative party a huge 17 point lead over the opposition -- the highest rating yet for the prime minister who is seeking a record third consecutive term.     the poll in today's sun popular tabloid showed the conservatives could win a solid majority of 125 seats in parliament in the next general election.     thatcher must call an election by june 1988 but is widely expected to call it this year.     the survey gave the conservatives 44 pct of the votes, left-wing labour and the centrist liberal-social democratic alliance 27 pct each.  reuter &#3;</h3>
