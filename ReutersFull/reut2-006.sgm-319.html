	<h3>bristol-myers co said scientists at its genetic systems unit, which markets a blood screening test for aids, have created an aids vaccine which produced antibodies to the aids virus in mice and monkeys.     the report said the vaccine will be tested in humans, but company officials were not immediately available to comment on when the tests would begin.     the report said the vaccine consists of smallpox virus remodeled to carry a key gene found on the aids virus, creating a hybrid virus that simultaneously immunizes against smallpox and the aids virus proteins.  reuter &#3;</h3>
