	<h3>japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa said that further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage the prospects for growth and adjustment and called for cooperation in exchange markets.     in a statement to the international monetary funds interim committee, miyazawa said it was imperative that current account surplus countries follow policies designed to strengthen domestic demand and reduce surpluses while maintaining price stability. he said japan intended to carry out policies announced at the paris meeting of finance ministers to stimulate its economy.     miyazawa said that, given the massive external imbalances and serious unemployment in some countries, "there are very real fears of a protectionist uprising."     in addition, "we are most concerned about this very serious problem of exchange rate instability," miyazawa said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
