	<h3>the supreme council of the united arab emirates (uae) has rejected the overthrow of the ruler of the emirate of sharjah, the emirates news agency, wam, reported.     the uae was plunged into a constitutional crisis yesterday after the ruling family of sharjah said its ruler sheikh sultan bin mohammed al-qassimi had abdicated in favour of one of his brothers because of financial mismanagement.     the council is the highest federal authority in the uae, comprising the rulers of the seven emirates which make up the group, but it has no power over the internal affairs of individual states, diplomatic sources said.     the supreme council met in emergency session, without a representative from sharjah, under the chairmanship of uae president sheikh zaid bin sultan al-nahayan, wam said.     it decided to ignore all statements issued from sharjah and would continue meeting until the issue was resolved, the agency added.     the qatar news agency said sheikh sultan was in dubai after flying back from a private visit to london. the emirate of dubai has rejected the sharjah explanation and said sheikh sultan was ousted by force. it said this was unacceptable and called for his reinstatement. the uae was formed in 1971.  reuter &#3;</h3>
