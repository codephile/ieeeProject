	<h3>debt among african countries will continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless developed countries lower their interest rates, nigerian trade minister samaila mamman said.     he told an informal general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) meeting the widening gap between developed and developing countries and an inequitable international economic system were major impediments to growth in developing countries.     delegates from 23 countries are attending the gatt talks in the new zealand resort of taupo.     "i wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of african countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries," mamman said.     "the developed market economy countries have slowed down output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity exports of african countries."     mamman said the world bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a year would be needed over the next five years for the african continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth (gdp) rate of three to four pct by 1990.     yet at the same time africa's debt service was estimated at 24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.     "with the best of intentions africa cannot attain a three to four pct gdp growth rate if the current high level of debt persists," mamman said. developed countries must seek alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of resources and more indebtedness, he said.     "the international community cannot fail to respond positively to the collapse of the international market for commodities ... and act quickly to stabilize demand and prices of our commodity exports," he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
