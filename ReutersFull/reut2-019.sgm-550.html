	<h3>european community agriculture ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an ec commission spokesman said.     he added that tomorrow's ec official journal will contain notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical nature which will come into effect on july 1 unless the ministers reach an accord.     the spokesman declined to detail these special measures but said they would not be the sort of "dynamic" moves which ec farm commissioner frans andriessen has said he would take in the case of complete deadlock among farm ministers.     these moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of ministers in brussels again fails to reach an accord, ec sources said.     andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources said.     ec farm ministers ended their last meeting on june 18 still split over the commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats.     in addition, west germany said it would veto plans for cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency system.     earlier today, diplomats said belgium, the current holder of the european community presidency, appears ready to drop the plans for the controversial oils and fats tax.  reuter &#3;</h3>
