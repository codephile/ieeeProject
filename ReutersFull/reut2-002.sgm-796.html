	<h3>struthers wells corp said it expects to report a loss, without tax benefit, of about 16 mln dlrs for the fiscal year ended november 30, 1986, versus a profit of 295,000 dlrs in fiscal 1985.     the company added, however, that about 13.6 mln dlrs of the loss relates to discontinued operations and disposal of subsidiaries.     the company said the loss is part of its previously announced restructuring that includes the sale of its foreign and domestic units.     struthers added that it has filed with the securities and exchange commission for an extension to file its annual report on form 10-k as a result of delays caused by the restructuring.  reuter &#3;</h3>
