	<h3>federal law enforcement authorities said they began a criminal investigation of r.j. reynolds tobacco co after the company imported herbicide-tainted tobacco and then exported tainted cigarettes to japan.     "we can confirm that the u.s. customs service has launched a criminal investigation of reynolds," a customs spokesman told reuters.     "there is an investigation under way," said bob edmunds, the u.s. attorney in greensboro, n.c.     reynolds is a subsidiary of rjr nabisco inc. of winston-salem, n.c.     the investigation is particularly embarrassing--for tokyo and washington, as well as the company--because the japanese government, under pressure from the united states, agreed only last year to open its markets to u.s.-made tobacco products.     r.j. reynolds spokesman david fishel said in a telephone interview that his company acknowledged importing into the united states large amounts of tobacco treated with a weedkiller called dicamba, and then exporting cigarettes made with the tobacco to japan. he acknowledged the weed killer was present in the tobacco at levels exceeding u.s. standards but said use of the tobacco did not pose a threat to human health.     "dicamba is approved by the government for use on a variety of crops including food crops, and is widely used as a ripening agent on tobacco," fishel said.     earlier today, japanese finance ministry official etsuzo kawade said in tokyo that government authorities were holding a large shipment of winston lights manufactured by r.j. reynolds after tests showed some of them contained unacceptable amounts of the weedkiller.     "we do not believe the herbicide posed a serious threat to people's health but the levels were unacceptable by law," kawade said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
