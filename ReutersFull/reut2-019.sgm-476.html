	<h3>cominco ltd said no talks were scheduled with striking workers at its trail smelter and kimberley, british columbia lead-zinc mine.     a company spokesman said the company and union met informally tuesday but talks did not constitute a formal bargaining session. the last formal talks were on june 5.     the workers went on strike may 9 and production has been shut down since then.     the trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead last year. the sullivan mine at kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore in 1986, most for processing at the trail smelter.      reuter &#3;</h3>
