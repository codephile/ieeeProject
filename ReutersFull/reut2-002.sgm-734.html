	<h3>outboard marine corp's top executives are making sales presentations to portfolio managers and analysts ahead of a planned two mln share offering expected soon, company officials said.     chairman charles strang and wayne jones, vice president for strategic planning, are meeting with portfolio managers in new york and boston to line up interest for the offering underwritten solely by morgan stanley, the officials said.     outboard marine has been the subject of recurring takeover rumors, with one rumor this week naming sun chemical as the potential suitor for 40 dlrs a share.     sun chemical is said to have 4.9 pct of outboard and is conducting a study on whether to bid for control of the marine engine and boatbuilding company. a sun chemical spokesman declined to comment.     stanley fishman, analyst at fahnestock and co, said it is better for a suitor to bid for outboard before the two mln shares are sold. outboard now has 17 mln shares outstanding.     "even though outboard would use proceeds from the share offering to pay down debt, and there would be less debt the acquiring company would assume, it still means more shares the suitor must buy to acquire the company," he said.     fishman, who has heard the sun chemical rumor, said a 40 dlrs a share would just open the bidding.     outboard marine today was trading at 33-5/8, down 5/8.     "there are only two companies that count in the marine leisure business, brunswick corp <bc> being the first. but you can't play down number two," he said. "it's a growing field. there's a lot of leisure money out there. i think 40 would be a minimum price. it will be higher."     a morgan stanley spokesman said the offering has been approved by the securities and exchange commission but a kick-off date and price have not been set.  reuter &#3;</h3>
