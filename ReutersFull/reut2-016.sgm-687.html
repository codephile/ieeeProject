	<h3>northair mines ltd said it would oppose nor-quest resources inc's earlier reported proposed takeover bid "with every means at its disposal," saying "this attempt at a property grab is an insult to the intelligence of our shareholders."     it said nor-quest's offer to swap one nor-quest share plus one dlr for two northair shares would seriously dilute northair's equity in its willa mine in british columbia.     "our company is in sound financial position and production financing can be readily arranged when required. we're not looking for a partner and if we were, it certainly wouldn't be these guys," northair said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
