	<h3>the national association of wheat growers, nawg, board of directors is scheduled to meet secretary of state george schultz and undersecretary of state allen wallis to discuss the department's current role in farm trade policy, the association said.     nawg president jim miller said in a statement that the organization wanted to convey to secretary schultz the importance that exports hold for u.s. agriculture and the degree to which farmers are dependent upon favorable state department trade policies to remain profitable.     "foreign policy decisions of the u.s. state department have in the past severely hampered our efforts to move our product to overseas markets," he said.     miller noted secretary schultz is scheduled to meet next month with representatives of the soviet union, and the nawg "wanted to be certain the secretary was aware of our concerns regarding the reopening of wheat trade with the soviet union."     the annual spring nawg board of directors meeting is held in washington to allow grower-leaders from around the country to meet with their state congressional delegations and members of the executive branch.     the purpose is to discuss the current situation for producing and marketing wheat and help set the legislative and regulatory agenda for the coming year, the nawg statement said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
