	<h3>u.k. chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said he expected british interest rates to fall soon in response to his fiscal 1987/88 budget, but he did not say by how much.     "i would be very surprised if there is not a very early further fall in interest rates," lawson said in a radio interview.     analysts said they foresaw u.k. base rates falling as early as today by as much as one full percentage point after lawson's announcement yesterday that the public sector borrowing requirement in fiscal 1987/88 and 1988/89 was to fall to 1.0 pct of gdp, or some four billion stg.     british banks' base lending rates fell a half percentage point on march 9 to the current 10.5 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
