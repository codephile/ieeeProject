	<h3>commerzbank ag <cbkg.f> management board chairman walter seipp said he hoped the bank would this year found a 100 pct investment bank subsidiary in new york.     he told the annual news conference that the move would be an important and necessary widening of business activities in the u.s.. this is now mainly represented by a 40 pct stake in europartners securities corp, new york, owned along with other european banks in a consortium.     it would also be a further step in commerzbank's full entry into global investment banking around the clock.     seipp also said securities trading activities had been considerably strengthened in london. the founding of commerz securities (japan) co. ltd, which would begin business in the first half of 1987, widened the bank's activity in tokyo.     in 1987 also, commerzbank planned to open a representative office in istanbul. currency trading had begun in the los angeles branch, he added.     at home, commerzbank would probably bring the automotive supply group boge and clothing manufacturer ahlers to a stock exchange flotation in the first half of this year.     but the placement of shares in the print communications technology group <linotype gmbh>, to be bought from allied signal inc <ald.n> would likely come later since several parts of the business had to be consolidated first.     seipp said the purchase price had been "several hundred million dollars." but he gave no further details.  reuter &#3;</h3>
