	<h3>the international finance corporation is planning to intervene to help certain developing country companies to borrow on world capital markets, ifc chief executive sir william ryrie told a news conference.     ryrie said the ifc is at present seeking to overcome regulatory barriers to its underwriting business on the united states and london markets.     "there are many companies in the more advanced developing countries which are strong enough to borrow by issuing bonds or floating rate notes," he added.     however, such companies needed help and the ifc could play a role by introducing them into the market and underwriting issues, ryrie said.     "the capital markets would then get used to the idea of buying the paper of these companies," he added. "there is a potential source of development finance there which could be very large."     he said he was confident there were enough institutional investors who would be interested in taking paper in the interests of portfolio diversification.     the ifc, whose role is to provide international financing for private sector investments in developing nations, generally does this by providing pump priming finance to persuade western companies to invest in third world enterprises.     however, in recent years it has set up three investment funds through which institutional investors can hold shares in developing country stock exchanges.     it announced the third such fund, one of 30 mln dlrs for investment on the thai stock exchange, in december. there is a 120 mln dlr south korea fund and one of 50 mln dlrs which invests in a number of developing country stock exchanges.  reuter &#3;</h3>
