	<h3>corporate affairs minister michael howard said he will use a coming trip to tokyo to seek a memorandum of understanding between britain and japan on the exchange of information to fight fraud in world financial markets.     he told journalists that he would be seeking an agreement with japan similar to one struck last autumn between the u.k. department of trade and industry, on the one hand, and the securities and exchange commission (sec) and the commodity futures trading commission on the other.     market sources have persistently speculated that it was information passed on to the u.k. by the sec through their pact that triggered the dti's investigations into (guinness plc's) <guin.l> takeover of <distillers co plc> last year.     the probe, launched in december, triggered the resignation of some of guinness' senior management, including chairman ernest saunders.     the trade department, however, has never confirmed this and has yet to state what its investigation actually concerns.  reuter &#3;</h3>
