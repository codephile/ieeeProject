	<h3>a turkish-west german joint venture, turk henkel a.s., issued the first commercial paper in turkey through private yapi ve kredi bankasi a.s., bank officials said.     "a total of 500 mln lira of commercial paper of turk henkel a.s. is on sale today," osman erk, deputy general-manager of yapi ve kredi bankasi told reuters.     he said the 90-day paper of the chemicals company has an annualised yield of 46.64 pct. turkey passed legislation last year allowing commercial paper.     erk said the capital and other requirements for issuing commercial paper is too high for some turkish companies to meet.     "the state capital markets board has also limited the yield with 46.64 pct, which is slightly higher than that of the 90-day government paper," erk said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
