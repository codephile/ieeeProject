	<h3>the bank of france said it invited offers of first category paper today for a money market intervention tender.     money market dealers said conditions seemed right for the bank to cut its intervention rate at the tender by a quarter percentage point to 7-3/4 pct from eight, reflecting an easing in call money rate last week, and the french franc's steadiness on foreign exchange markets since the february 22 currency stabilisation accord here by the group of five and canada.     intervention rate was last raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 on january 2. call money today was quoted at 7-11/16 7-3/4 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
