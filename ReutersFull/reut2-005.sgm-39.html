	<h3>expiration dates on upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program are being extended, the agriculture department announced.     the certificates are being extended because of a shortage of commodity credit corporation inventory available for exchange with certificates, usda undersecretary danial amstutz said.     presently, upland cotton commodity certificates expire nine months from the last day of the month of issuance.     under the new procedure, all current outstanding and all new upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program will have an expiration date of either february 29, 1988, or nine months from the last day of the month in which the certificate is issued, whichever is later.  reuter &#3;</h3>
