	<h3>silver, trading at around two year highs, began sharply higher in relatively active trading, pulling platinum up a little in its wake, dealers said. however, gold began little changed.     silver began here at 6.74/79 dlrs an ounce, up 22 cents from the previous close here. it had briefly touched the 6.80 dlr level at the end of far eastern trading.     the metal then fell back a little further, largely on profit-taking, but dealers said demand still remained good. however, it was not clear whether there could be a further slight downturn before the rise continued.     gold began at 421.8/422.2 dlrs an ounce, 3.70 dlrs above the new york close but just 25 cents above the previous close here.     platinum began 4.50 dlrs higher at 567/571 dlrs an ounce.  reuter &#3;</h3>
