	<h3><spar aerospace ltd>, reporting a sharply lower 1986 profit, said it anticipated solid profit and revenue growth during the next five years.     "looking to the longer term, spar is confident that its continuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based communications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to significant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five years," the company said.     it also forecast higher 1987 sales due to an increased order backlog. revenues last year fell to 191 mln dlrs from 223.3 mln while profit fell to 4.4 mln dlrs from 13.1 mln.     spar added that lower development costs in the communications group and a return to normal operations in gears and transmissions and aviation services "will remove a serious drain on profits" this year.     it attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new products and market development, a four-month strike at its toronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from customers to start work on new programs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
