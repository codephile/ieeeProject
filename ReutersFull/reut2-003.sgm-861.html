	<h3>maoist guerrillas using dynamite derailed two locomotives and four train wagons, interrupting traffic on peru's sole railway line linking the capital to the central andes, where most of the country's mining centres are located, authorities said.     damages was estimated at 800,000 dlrs in the dynamite blast yesterday at chacapalca, where the explosion wrecked the train laden with minerals and 45 metres of the railway line.     crews hoped to restore traffic to the line later today after clearing the damaged train and repairing the tracks at chacapalca, 225 km east of the capital, lima.     an official at mineroperu comercial (minpeco), peru's state minerals marketing firm, said the agency was assessing the situation. there had not been a declaration of force majeure on contracts to ship minerals abroad.     foreign sales of silver, copper, zinc and other minerals earn peru over half of its export income. most of the minerals, extracted and refined in the central peruvian andes, are shipped down the central railway to the lima port of callao.  reuter &#3;</h3>
