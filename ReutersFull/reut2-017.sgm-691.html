	<h3>zenith laboratoreis inc said it was voluntarily recalling 20 lots of digoxin, a cardiovascular drug, because about seven of the lots made betweeen october 1984 and janauary 1986 failed to meet certain requirements.     the lot number of digoxin, in 0.25 mg tablets, are 112 through 131. zenith said the recalled lots were not likely to cause serious ill health effects, but said the recall is being done because some of the lots failed to meet dissolutation requirements upon retesting.     zenith said the other lots are not subject to the recall. it said the recall will cost about 50,000 dlrs.   reuter &#3;</h3>
