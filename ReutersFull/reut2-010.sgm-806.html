	<h3>remarks by japan's prime minister yasuhiro nakasone that last month's g-6 meeting agreed to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to influence currency trading, dealers said.     after nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen from an initial low of 144.20/40 and new york's friday finish of 147.15/25. but the rebound was largely on short-covering, they said.     "i think (nakasone's) desperate," said a u.s. bank foreign exchange manager.     nakasone told a lower house budget committee in parliament that japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen.     finance minister kiichi miyazawa told the same committee that the six - britain, canada, france, japan, the u.s. and west germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen.     "his (nakasone) remarks should have been made and should have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150 yen," said p.s. tam of morgan guaranty trust.     tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  and is likely to rebound. but he warned of another dip to below 145 yen.     dealers said the worsening trade relations between the u.s. and japan will continue to depress the dollar.     the trade issue has now become a political issue since the reagan administration is facing uproar in congress over th3pygks in cutting the country's 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
