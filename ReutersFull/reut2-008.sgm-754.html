	<h3><a/s norske shell>, royal dutch/shell group's <rd.as> norwegian subsidiary, said it has nearly concluded a 10 billion crown development scheme for norway's draugen oil field and will declare the field commercial in the near future.     pending government approval of the scheme, the field could come on stream in 1992, making it norway's northermost field development and the first such project on the haltenbanken tract off central norway.     work on the project could begin as early as january 1988, a shell spokesman said.     shell has not released projected output levels for the field, where water depth is 240-270 meters.     the spokesman said the field's partners have agreed to develop draugen with a 300-meter, single-leg concrete gravity-base platform.     the scheme also proposes using remote subsea production wells to tap the field's reservoir, estimated to contain 375 mln barrels of oil, and an offshore buoy-loading system to transport oil from the field by ship.     partners on draugen are shell, the operator, with a 30 pct stake, british petroleum co plc <bp.l> unit <bp petroleum development (norway) ltd> (20 pct) and state-owned den norske stats oljeselskap a/s <stat.ol> (statoil) (50 pct).  reuter &#3;</h3>
