	<h3>the senate cleared away a parliamentary obstacle threatening final passage of a 9.4 billion dlr money bill for the rest of fiscal 1987 ending october 1.     the senate voted 64 to 32 to override objections the bill's money total violated the 1987 budget, a vote that required 60 votes for approval.     the house-passed measure, debated by the senate since may 7, carries funds for most government activities with the bulk --6.7 billion dlrs--for agriculture support programs.     final passage could come late tonight or tomorrow.  reuter &#3;</h3>
