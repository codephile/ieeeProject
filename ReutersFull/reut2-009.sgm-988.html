	<h3>the senate voted unanimously to seek an expedited u.s. probe of canadian tariffs on corn imports to determine if the united states should retaliate.     by 99 to 0, the senate went on record against the 84.9 cents per bushel tariff approved by the canadian import tribunal.     the non binding measure asked for a probe by the u.s. trade representative to determine within 30 days whether the tariff violates the general agreement on tariffs and trade, and if so recommend within 60 days to president reagan retaliatory action against canada.  reuter &#3;</h3>
