	<h3>transnational industries inc said due to continuing manufacturing difficulties at its alloytek inc jet engine component subsidiary, it expects to report a net loss of about 300,000 dlrs or 12 cts per share for the fourth quarter ended january 31.     it said revenues for the period were about 11.9 mln dlrs, about even with those of a year earlier.     for the full fiscal year, the company said it earned about 775,000 dlrs or 34 cts per share, down from 1,402,000 dlrs or 76 cts per share a year before.     the company said an unexpectedly large volume of customer inquiries at its spitz inc simulation products subsidiary has caused higher than expected business development outlays.     the company said it expects significant contract awards to spitz later this year.     it said it has started implementing a plan to progressively reduce manufacturing costs at alloytek over the next several quarters.  the company said it may move alloytek's plant from grandville, mich., to a lower labor cost area.     the company said it discovered the extent of the alloytek problems during a year-end review of subcontracts and related work in progress for production of jet engine components for general electric co <ge>.     it said it will release annual results around april 15.  reuter &#3;</h3>
