	<h3>the u.s. agriculture department is preparing a proposal that would require all foreign meat products to be inspected at their point of arrival in the united states, a usda official said.     donald houston, administrator of usda's food safety and inspection service, fsis, told a house agriculture subcommittee usda was developing a proposed change in regulations that would put an end to the current practice of permitting foreign meat products to be unloaded at one port and inspected at another port.     houston said the requirement would be phased in over several years to "avoid disruptions and economic hardship."  reuter &#3;</h3>
