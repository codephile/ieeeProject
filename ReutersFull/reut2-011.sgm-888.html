	<h3>japan has reiterated it has no plans to bow to pressure to give foreign telecommunications companies a major role in a planned new firm.     an official at the ministry of post and telecommunications told reuters the ministry's position is unchanged despite mounting pressure from london and washington. he declined comment on local press reports which said the ministry would back a plan aimed at cooling british anger on the issue.     the press reports said fumio watanabe, head of the federation of economic organisations, would propose that britain's cable and wireless plc be given a five pct stake in a telecommunications firm and a seat on the board.     watanabe was unavailable for comment. he has the tacit backing of the government in his efforts to merge two telecommunications companies into one competitor to kokusai denwa denshin (kdd), which has a monopoly on international telephone services here, industry analysts said.     in london yesterday, a cable and wireless spokesman said the latest reported proposals are unacceptable.     cable and wireless has a 20 pct stake in one of the two companies involved in the mooted merger.     british prime minister margaret thatcher has personally taken up the company's cause, charging that japan is discriminating against foreigners.     the united states also has vented its anger at what it sees as japanese attempts to limit foreign participation.     watanabe originally proposed cable and wireless be given up to 3.0 pct of the merged firm. the press reports said this could be raised to 5.0 pct, equal to the largest share of any japanese firm. britain opposes the proposed merger. reuter &#3;</h3>
