	<h3>u.s. treasury assistant secretary david mulford said he foresaw substantial net new commercial loans to the major debtor countries in 1987.     in testimony before a senate banking subcommittee, mulford said he based this prediction on progress in talks between banks and mexico, chile, and venezuela, as well as progress in negotiations with the philippines.     "these agreements, together with others for argentina and we hope brazil," should assure substantial new loans this year, mulford said.     mulford defended the u.s. strategy for handling the debt crisis and added additional steps, like development by commercial banks of a menu of options to support debtor reform, can be undertaken.     that particular development would maintain broad bank participation in new financing packages to debtors.     mulford stessed that greater flexibility in devising new money packages may be essential for future bank syndications.     "the commercial banks have much to gain from taking the lead themselves to develop the kinds of ideas that help assure the concerted lending process works," he said.     in particular, mulford said banks and debtor nations will increasingly move toward repricing, retiming or rescheduling agreements as an alternative to new loans.     "the benefits of such approaches may be substantial and may, in the right circumstances, be easier to achieve than new money packages," he said.     but for debtors with substantial financing needs, new lending will still be necessary, he said.     mulford rejected congressional ideas for a debt facility as being far too costly to creditor governments, and ultimately taxpayers.     mulford urged further development of debt-equity swaps as well as broader mutual funds for conversion into equity.     as in the past, mulford said progress must be founded on economic reforms and sufficient new financing for debtors both to support those reforms and generate new growth.  reuter &#3;</h3>
