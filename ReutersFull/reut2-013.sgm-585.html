	<h3>the danish government said it planned tax changes to discourage people making shopping trips to west germany and other countries where consumer durables are cheaper.     tax minister isi foighel told journalists the government will present a bill abolishing sales tax - generally 10 to 20 pct - on radios, record players, loudspeakers, video tapes, vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens and small household items.     the annual loss in revenue of 275 mln danish crowns will be made up by higher duties on four-wheel drive vehicles and small pick-up vans, which will be taxed in future as commercial vehicles under two tonnes.     foighel also announced small reductions in the concessions for duty-free imports to compensate for a strengthening of the danish crown.     he said maximum concessions would apply in future only to travellers out of the country for more than 24 hours. those returning within that period will have to prove to customs that they have been on more than a shopping trip.     the tax move follows an official report showing that total border imports, about three billion crowns in 1985, rose by some 600 mln crowns in 1986, a trend which has alarmed danish businesses, particularly in jutland areas bordering germany.  reuter &#3;</h3>
