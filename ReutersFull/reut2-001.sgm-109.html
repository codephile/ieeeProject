	<h3>belgian foreign trade minister herman de croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the european community, ec, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the united states.     de croo, in washington for talks with administration officials and congressional leaders, said at a news conference there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and oils used in the 12 ec countries.     but he added, "i do not think it will be a big issue because there will be a big debate inside europe," adding "so there will be a compromise."     u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter said yesterday that if the community went ahead with the tax, the united states would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights and access to community markets.     de croo also said he thought the community would postpone its april 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to cover all meats brought into ec nations if some progress was made toward resolving differences with the united states.     u.s. officials say its rules now meet health standards and the ec should require equivalent but not identical standards.     he also told reporters he hoped the community could deal with another controversial health proposal that would forbid the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the united states.     de croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be resolved. that rule is go into effect on january 1, 1988.     he said u.s. cattlemen say there is no reason to change slaughterhouse practices in april if the meat is to be banned a few months later by the hormone rule.  reuter &#3;</h3>
