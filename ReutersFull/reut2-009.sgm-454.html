	<h3>immunogenetics inc said it has entered the liposome technology field through its majority owned subsidiary, molecular packaging systems inc.     liposomes are small sacks of lipid, or fat, membranes arranged in layers like an onion. these sacks can carry a variety of agents that are released over a period of time into the body as the onion-like layers break down.     it said molecular has developed a versatile low-cost method for encapsulating a broad range of health care and industrial products, including human hemoglobin which transports oxygen in the blood.     immunogenetics also said molecular's liposomes, called micropak, can carry more than five times the amount of particles than conventional liposomes.     the company also said its technology for encapsulating hemoglobin may prove helpful in preventing the spread of hepatitis and the aids virus in blood transfusions as all viruses and foreign agents are moved during preparation of the hemogloblin.  reuter &#3;</h3>
