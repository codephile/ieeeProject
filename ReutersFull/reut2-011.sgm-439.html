	<h3>cpl real estate trust investment said its regular quarterly dividend distribution will be lower than its present 26 cts per share, and could be significantly lower starting with the third quarter of 1987.     the company, which lowered the payout from 27 cts to 26 cts this current quarter, said it did not know how low the payout would go.     the company said the reason for the cutbacks was because it would not be purchasing a property it had anticipated, and alternative investments will produce significantly lower yields than anticipated.   reuter &#3;</h3>
