	<h3>the u.s. department of agriculture's forecast that french end-of-season soft wheat stocks will almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be surprising, according to french cereal organisation officials.     the cereals intervention board, onic, wheat producers' association and the national union of agricultural and cereal cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or end-of-season stocks.     however, the officials said the usda's figure of end 1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in april.     the french feed cereals research institute, itcf, forecast in mid-april an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.     this would result in a french soft wheat harvest of around 31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a ministry of agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.     onic's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign will be released at the beginning of september, an onic official said.     soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to estimate at this stage, both within the european community and to non-ec countries, an onic official said.     he said, however, that among countries to which france could increase its wheat exports were egypt and the maghreb countries (morocco, algeria and tunisia), he said.     the usda's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in 1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature, was not out of line with estimates of the french maize producers association, agpm, an agpm official said.     maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were expected to be higher, the agpm official said.     it estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares, down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.  reuter &#3;</h3>
