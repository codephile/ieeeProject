	<h3>outgoing united states ambassador stephen bosworth told a news conference he did not think the philippines would follow brazil's example and suspend interest payments on foreign loans from commercial banks.     "i see no evidence that the philippine government even contemplates doing that. it has said at the outset that it accepts the legitimacy of these debts and it is determined over time to meet its obligations fully," he said.     philippine officials and a 12-bank committee have been meeting for the past four weeks in new york in a bid to reschedule 9.4 billion dlrs of foreign debt.     bosworth said the united states strongly supports manila's bid to put its international financial situation in order and that the private bank creditors were aware of that.     "i think there is no question that the private banks are aware of the views of the u.s. government ... i am confident they will take those views into account when they make their own decisions," bosworth said.     he added: "these are private banks. they are responsible to their shareholders and they have to make their decisions on their own. but i am confident they understand the views of the united states and our strong support."  reuter &#3;</h3>
