	<h3>a senior abu dhabi oil official said in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the united arab emirates (uae), was succeeding in marketing its crude oil without breaching opec accords.     khalaf al-oteiba, marketing director at the abu dhabi national oil co (adnoc), told the company's petroleum community magazine adnoc was also keen to keep good customer relations. "the company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...and take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said.    "the present oil marketing policy of adnoc is based on adherence to opec decisions of december 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market," he added.     opec agreed last december to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.     oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline opec showed.     oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was adnoc's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment."     he said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.     in 1985, adnoc marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.  reuter &#3;</h3>
