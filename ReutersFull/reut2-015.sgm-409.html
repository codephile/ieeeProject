	<h3>saudi riyal interest rates rose as bahrain-based banks scrambled to cover short positions, dealers said.     several bahrain banks had been lending in the fixed periods and borrowing in the short dates, but today they found the day-to-day money in short supply, dealers said.     "everybody's stuck in the spot-next," one trader said.     spot-next rose to as high as 6-1/4, six pct from 5-1/4, five pct yesterday, and the borrowing interest spilled over into the periods, with one month rising to around 6-3/16, 5-15/16 pct from 5-15/16, 7/8 pct yesterday.     three months edged up to around 6-9/16, 5/16 pct from 6-7/16, 1/4 pct, while six months was quoted a touch firmer by some banks at seven, 6-3/4 pct.     commercial banks quoted the spot riyal at 3.7500/04 to the dollar after 3.7507/09 yesterday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
