	<h3>dominion resources inc said it has reahced an understanding under which the national coal association would withdraw its opposition to the company's petition for exemptions from the powerplant and industrial fuel use act of 1978.     the company needs the exemptions from the u.s. department of energy to allow it to build the combined cycle generating units chesterfield 7 and 8.  chesterfield 7, a 210 megawatt unit planned for service in june 1990 at a cost of about 130 mln dlrs, would initially burn natural gas. companion unit chesterfield 8 would be built by june 1992.     dominion said the coal group withdrew its opposition to the plants after dominion said it would be willing to pursue installation of a coal gasifier for chesterfield under proper economic conditions, so that the units could burn coal gas.  reuter &#3;</h3>
