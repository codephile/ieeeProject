	<h3>deutsche bank ag <dbkg.f> has agreed to take over the outstanding 25 pct in <deutsche bank (asia) ag>, the former <european asian bank ag>, from creditanstalt-bankverein <cabv.vi>, deutsche management board joint spokesman alfred herrhausen told a news conference.     euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from deutsche, he said. he gave no details of the deal with creditanstalt.     press reports that deutsche was planning a takeover of lloyds bank plc <lloy.l> were without foundation, he said.     herrhausen said deutsche had taken part in the recent capital increase of <morgan grenfell group plc>, but had no plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in morgan grenfell.     <banca d'america e d'italia spa>, in which 98.3 pct was acquired from bankamerica corp <bac.n> late last year, would be consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman f. wilhelm christians said.     following a ruling earlier this year from the federal high court, deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the balance sheet section "participations," christians said.     but christians said the bank still regarded shares in these non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active participation.     parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.     herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in a separate holding company.  reuter &#3;</h3>
