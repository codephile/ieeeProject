	<h3>sears roebuck and co, said it reached an out-of-court settlement with the federal trade commission over the labeling of some down-filled garments sold in 1978 "to avoid further legal expenses."     in a statement, michael bozic, chairman of sears merchandise group, said "as part of the voluntary corrective program, sears removed 75 mln dlrs worth of down-filled merchandise from sale prior to the ftc investigation, retested and where necessary, relabeled goods and nationally offered a full refund."     sears said it was "the only retailer to take extensive steps to protect consumers, despite the fact that down-labeling discrepancies were industry-wide in 1978."     both sears and kellwood co, a sears supplier, agreed to pay penalties of 200,000 dlrs each to settle the charges.  reuter &#3;</h3>
