	<h3>usair group said it sought the help of the u.s. department of transportation in its takeover fight with trans world airlines inc, asking the department to order twa to sell its usair shares.     "what they have done is in direct violation of the federal aviation act," usair said.     it said twa week filed a cursory application with the department of transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65 billion dlr takeover of usair.     usair rejected the offer and said it asked the department of transportation to dismiss the application.     usair said it requested the dismissal because twa avoided pre-merger notification requirements, and also did not provide a competitive and public interest analysis required under regulations.     usair said if the application is dismissed, twa would be limited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstanding shares. if the application is approved, twa could buy up to 10 pct, it said. twa has said it owns less than 10 pct of usair's stock.     twa today revealed that it has increased its holdings to more than four mln usair shares, 15 pct of the outstanding.     twa vice president general counsel mark buckstein said the company had made appropriate filings with the dot and was in compliance with the law.  reuter &#3;</h3>
