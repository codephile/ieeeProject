	<h3>moody's investors service inc said it downgraded the debt ratings of baker international corp and upgraded hughes tool co's debt.     the actions affect a combined 662 mln dlrs of securities.     moody's said the anticipated merger of baker and hughes tool into baker hughes inc would result in increased financial leverage at a time of weak demand for the combined company's products and services.     the agency cut the senior debt of baker and its finance unit, baker international finance n.v., to baa-1 from a-2. it affirmed baker's prime-2 commercial paper.     moody's upgraded hughes tool's senior debt to baa-1 from b-2 and subordinated debt to baa-2 from b-3.     the rating agency said that a poor outlook for the oil services industry would pressure earnings and cash flow for basker hughes over the intermediate term.     however, moody's noted that the combined company would benefit from cost reductions and consolidations made possible by the merger. also, the company's competitive position should be substantially strengthened by the merger, moody's said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
