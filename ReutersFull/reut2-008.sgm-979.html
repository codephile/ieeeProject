	<h3>a new agreement covering the repayment of part of south africa's foreign debt represents a compromise between that country and its commercial bank creditors following several weeks of intense and difficult negotiations, senior banking sources said.     in pretoria, reserve bank governor gerhard de kock termed the agreement a "good deal" for both south africa and the banks.     but as one senior banker noted, "it is probably the best we could hope for. we (the banks) wanted more money and they (the south africans) didn't want to pay."     the new agreement will extend for three years the standstill arrangement that has been in place since august 1985 and which was due to expire on june 30.     depending on the maturity of the various debts, banks will receive on july 15 repayments representing three pct of the arrears and the overdue debt covered by the standstill.     it also will require the repayment over the life of the standstill of another 10 pct of the overdue debt spread over six month invervals and depending on the maturity of the various debts for a total of slightly more than 1.4 billion dlrs.     last year south africa repaid about 500 mln dlrs out of the 14 billion dlrs covered by the standstill. at the time, bankers had argued - unsuccessfully - for a larger repayment given the country's trade surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs.     bankers had hoped that this time they could secure an even larger repayment of around one billion dlrs. although there had been speculation that the standstill would be extended for three years, many did not believe that a long term pact would be acceptable to u.s. banks. those banks have taken a hard line in the negotiations because of america's strong anti-apartheid policies.     the agreement reached today differs very little from the one reached a little over a year ago. however, it does include one moderation of an option contained in that pact which introduces yet another "catchphrase" into the jargon for reschedulings.     the new agreement contains an "exit vehicle" under which banks can convert their debt into 10 year loans. under the previous agreement banks were only given options for three year loans.     while the option may be unpalatable to the u.s. banks, it could offer others a potential repayment of slightly more than half their investment over the next seven years.     to convert the debts, a bank would have to find a borrower looking for a loan with a 10-year maturity and then negotiate individually the interest rates to be charged.     the loans would not represent any new money and as the loan would be the obligation of the new borrower there would be a repayment stream that could give the bank as much as 52 pct of face value by year seven, one banker said.     bankers suggested that depending on a banks' political and economic forecasts for south africa, if it decided to take the option it may not have much difficulty finding such borrowers. they noted that south africa's public investment commission is an active borrower in this area of the market.     today's agreement was reached between south africa's chief debt negotiator chris stals, who chairs its standstill coordinating commmittee and representatives of the 12 banks on the commercial bank technical committee.     the bankers said that telexes will be sent today to the country's other 330 bank creditors and that documentation covering the proposal will be mailed out shortly.     because of the banks' sensitivity to south africa's apartheid regime, the previous negotiations were conducted with fritz leutwiler, the former head of the swiss national bank, acting as mediator.     leutwiler was not involved with these talks and has not involved himself in the negotiations since last year, the bankers said.     last time, the banks sent their responses on the proposal to leutwiler who in turn notified the south africans. this time the procedure will be less structured and will be up to the individual banks as to how they wish to handle it.     although talks had been held in recent weeks between the south africans and the banks, the completion of the agreement on the repayments took many in the financial community by surprise.     a review of south africa's economy by the technical committee's economic sub-committee was to be held in february while the talks for the rescheduling were due to start some time this month or next month.     however, the bankers said that because of all the publicity which surrounds south african debt negotiations, the meetings were kept secret.  reuter &#3;</h3>
