	<h3>president reagan today had talks with kenyan president daniel arap moi, who afterwards appealed for more u.s. investment in kenya and a deeper american commitment to ending apartheid in south africa.     a senior administration official said that during the talks reagan stressed to moi the importance of kenya's maintaining its high standards on human rights.     the official said south africa had not been a contentious issue in the talks and that the two leaders had found a lot of common ground on the issue.      the administration has practiced a policy of "constructive engagement" with south africa and accepted trade sanctions only after they had been imposed by congress.  reuter &#3;</h3>
