	<h3>finance minister kiichi miyazawa said he had no intention of modifying at the moment a proposed bill introducing a sales tax.     "parliamentary deliberation must be conducted fully before we see whether to revise it or not," miyazawa told reporters.     he also said he had not heard anything about deputy premier shin kanemaru suggesting modification of the tax.     the japanese press has reported that kanemaru proposed yesterday a freeze or a modification of the value-added tax as he saw growing public opposition.     debate on the sales tax has been stalled by a sporadic opposition boycott over their objections to the tax.     miyazawa said he did not expect the bill to be altered even after parliament completes its deliberations. he also said the government is undecided on the scale of a proposed provisional budget for fiscal 1987 beginning on april 1.     the minister declined to comment on wide-spread press speculation that the stop-gap budget would total more than 1,000 billion yen.  reuter &#3;</h3>
