	<h3>general public utilities corp said the water-clarity problem delaying the removal of fuel from the damaged unit two of the three mile island nuclear power plant appears to have been resolved.     the company said the slower than expected removal of the fuel, which has been primarily due to the water-clarity problems, is now expected to extend fuel removal into 1988.     a spokesman said the company had previously expected this to be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated how far into 1988 the process will extend. it still expects to complete the entire clean-up by the end of 1988, he added.     gpu said its auditors, coopers and lybrand, again qualified its opinion of gpu's financial statements, adding the recovery of tmi-2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leading to the qualified opinion.     gpu said its operating subsidiaries will seek to recover the costs of decommissioning tmi-2 in future rate proceedings.     as in past years, the qualified opinion continues to list other uncertainties associated with the accident, which damaged tmi-2 -- the recovery of cleanup costs and any payments for damages that might exceed available insurance proceeds.  reuter &#3;</h3>
