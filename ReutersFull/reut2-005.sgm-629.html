	<h3>pacific resources inc said it has installed a calm (catenary anchor leg mooring) single-point mooring terminal off the southwest coast of oahu at its hawaiian independent refinery at a cost of 3.5 mln dlrs.     the system transfers crude and fuel oils from tankers to the refinery's tank farm and carries refined products to ships for export, pri said.     company chairman robert g. reed said the new mooring system will permit 24-hour service in most kinds of weather and will reduce ship turnaround time. he said the mooring is the first of its kind in the u.s.     the new system can accomodate vessels up to 150,000 deadweight tons, or one mln barrels of cargo, pri said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
