"at the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts," mousavi told the radio, monitored by the british broadcasting corporation.     tehran radio reported over 1,500 iraqi casualties today as iran continued its karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday.     iran said over 2,600 iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties.     mousavi told tehran radio that "on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of saddam."     earlier today the iranian news agency irna said tehran's forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on iraqi lines defending basra, iraq's second city.     in baghdad, a military spokesman said iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at iran's ahvaz field.  reuter &#3;</h3>
