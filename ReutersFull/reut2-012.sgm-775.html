	<h3>a top japanese official has insisted that the country was living up to its microchip pact with the us.     "it cannot be thought, nor should it be thought, we are trying to dominate semiconductors," ministry of international trade and industry (miti) vice minister makoto kuroda said in a newspaper interview.     kuroda, who will head a japanese team going to washington next week for emergency talks on semiconductors, told the tokyo shimbun that he would try his best to convince the united states of japan's case.      washington last week announced an imposition of tariffs on japanese electronic products in retaliation for what it sees as tokyo's failure to abide by the pact. under the agreement japan would stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and try to buy more american chips.     kuroda told the newspaper that tokyo has already taken measures to back up the pact, including production cutbacks.     while japanese users are trying to increase chip imports, tokyo cannot guarantee the united states a specified share of what in japan is a free market, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
