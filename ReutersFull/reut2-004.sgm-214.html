	<h3>the ec commission said it was adopting an "open attitude" about whether a system of production quotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel products which account for about 45 pct of all ec steel goods.     in a statement, the commission reiterated its view that the industry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity by 1990. it had previously said the quota system, started in 1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year.     the industry has argued for the maintenance of existing quotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almost all steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market.  reuter &#3;</h3>
