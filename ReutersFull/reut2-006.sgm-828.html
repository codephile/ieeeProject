	<h3>the canadian government welcomed president reagan's announcement that he would seek 2.5 billion dlrs over five years to combat acid rain.     "this action on the part of the u.s. administration serves well our ultimate objective of a bilateral accord providing for a common resolution of this serious environment problem," prime minister brian mulroney said in a statement.     environment minister tom mcmillan said the reagan announcement was a major step toward elimination of acid rain and that canada was pleased with the u.s. decision.     the reagan announcement earlier today said the administration would ask congress to approve 500 mln dlrs in each of the next two fiscal years to fund innovative projects to control smokestack emissions -- blamed for acid rain that has killed fish and trees in eastern canada and the northeastern united states.     canada has been pressing the reagan administration to live up to a commitment made last year for 5 billion dlrs in spending by the u.s. government and industry to cut toxic emissions that cause acid rain.     the acid rain issue has been the major irritant in canada-u.s. relations for several years, with ottawa accusing washington of failing to act on the issue.  reuter &#3;</h3>
