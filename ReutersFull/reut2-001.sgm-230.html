"after careful review and analysis of our capacitry requirements, it has become necessary for us to close norwood at the end of the 1987 model year," gm vice-president and group executive robert schultz said.     gm previously said it would close the plant in a capacity reduction, but did not specify a precise date. the cars will still be built at gm's van nuys, calif., plant.  reuter &#3;</h3>
