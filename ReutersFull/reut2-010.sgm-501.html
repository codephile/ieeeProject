	<h3>deere and co said it agreed with general motors corp to discontinue negotiations on the formation of a joint venture company to design, manufacture and market diesel engines.     however, the company said it will continue a marketing arrangement with gm established in 1985 under which john deere diesel engines are distributed worldwide through gm's detroit diesel allison division.     deere said it and gm began studying the feasibility of forming a diesel engine joint venture in march, 1985. they signed a memorandum of understanding to combine the diesel engine operations of deere and detroit diesel allison in july 1986 subject to final negotiations and government clearances.     it said the companies' exploration of the potential joint venture made it clear there were more effective means to serve the interests of their engine customers than by combining manufacturing assets.  reuter &#3;</h3>
