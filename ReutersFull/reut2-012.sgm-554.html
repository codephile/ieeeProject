	<h3>the european community (ec) is to boost spending to help the jobless this year.     the ec's executive commission said in a statement spending on its so-called social fund would rise to 3.1 billion european currency units from 2.5 billion ecus in 1986. the fund is designed to help boost job creation and improve worker mobility, and supplement national schemes in the ec's 12 member states.     another 60 mln ecus could be added if ec ministers switch unused project credits to other programs, the commission said.     italy is the largest net beneficiary in 1987, getting 635 mln ecus, with britain in second place with 580 mln.  reuter &#3;</h3>
