	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it expects downgrades of corporate debt ratings to ease this year from the lofty levels of 1986 and 1985.     however, the rating agency said upgrades will probably stay at about the same level as in the past few years.     the narrowing of the gap between downgrades and upgrades would reflect a calming in takeover frenzy, less volatile energy markets and slow but steady economic growth, s and p said.     in particular, s and p expects that the industrial and banking sectors would have a less turbulent year than in 1986.     s and p noted that 60 pct of 1986's downgrades were concentrated in the industrial sector, where the most negative factor was takeover fever that led to debt-financed mergers and acquisitions and costly defenses to fend off takeovers.     it said takeovers appear to be on the decline this year.     while s and p noted that the energy markets have stabilized after last year's collapse, it stressed that 1987 would not mark a turnaround for this industry.     in addition, s and p does not expect any big shocks to hit the junk bond market this year, especially of the magnitude of 1986's unexpected ltv corp <ltv> bankruptcy filing.     utilities, which were a positive influence in the overall 1986 trend, should be a pocket of strength again this year. but like last year, gas utilities could buck this trend, s and p said.     the rating agency said that downgrades would continue to outpace upgrades among financial institutions. but 1987's rating changes will not be as skewed as 1986's 2.1 to one ratio of downgrades to upgrades, s and p predicted.     s and p said debt ratings for the transportation industry would remain stable, aside from changes because of mergers. a detailed report will appear in the march 9 s/p creditweek.  reuter &#3;</h3>
