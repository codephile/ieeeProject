	<h3>brazilian finance minister dilson funaro, who suspended interest payments to creditor banks two months ago, said creditors had to trust him when he said brazil would achieve a trade surplus large enough to continue servicing its debt.     speaking to reporters at the brazilian embassy, funaro said he would not seek approval of brazil's economic program outside his country, but added, "at the same time we show credibility, you (the banks) are going to have to trust us."     asked if creditor banks would accept brazil's refinancing needs based on a new economic program not endorsed by the international monetary fund, funaro said, "what other options do they have?...they have to try to see our program."     funaro, who is in washington to attend the interim committee and development committee meetings of the world bank and imf, said he unveiled his refinancing proposals to the major creditor banks in new york yesterday.     according to funaro, the creditor banks "agreed on the need to find a solution to the crisis." he did not elaborate.     funaro said the commercial banks agreed on brazil's need for economic growth and added that creditors were aware that brazil cannot continue to export the 24 billion dlrs in net capital that it transferred over the past three years.     he also said that he told bankers about brazil's needs to ensure a seven pct average growth and eight billion to 11 billion dlr trade surplus until 1991.     administration officials familiar with the negotiations said brazil's new economic measures did not make much sense based on current conditions in that country, and added that they saw long and difficult negotiations ahead.     lewis preston, chairman of j.p. morgan and co. inc., told reuters he remains hopeful that brazil and its foreign bank creditors will reach a debt rescheduling agreement before the end of the year.     but preston, who did not attend the meeting between funaro and creditor banks yesterday, added the onus is still on brazil to put its economic house in order first.     "they haven't even come up with a plan yet," preston said after morgan's annual meeting in new york today.     funaro, however, said most creditor banks had representatives in brazil who were well aware of brazil's new economic measures, designed to curb a surge in inflation and spending and a sharp drop in exports.     funaro called brazil's program very responsible and very strong, adding that "it is very different from other years, there has been a tremendous change."     based on brazil's current economic situation - suspension of interest payments on 67 billion dlrs owed to banks, 200 pct inflation and the need of four billion dlrs in new loans every year until 1991 - he said he was faced with two options. reuter... &#3;</h3>
