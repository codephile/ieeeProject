	<h3>the dollar remained confined in the same narrow range in quiet trading, benefitting only slightly from comments by fed chairman paul volcker that further sizeable dollar losses would be counter-productive, dealers said.     it finished at 1.5140/50 swiss francs after opening at 1.5128/38 and closing yesterday at 1.5185/95.     "volcker's remarks produced some buying interest but most people were still waiting to see what comes out of the finance ministers' meetings in washington," one dealer said.     other currencies lost ground against the swiss franc.     sterling eased after advancing sharply yesterday on expectations of an early u.k. general election. the pound ended at 2.4469/4501 francs compared with 2.4547/4578 yesterday.     the mark slipped to 82.83/93 centimes from 83.11/21 and the french franc dipped to 24.90/94 from 24.98/25.02.  reuter &#3;</h3>
