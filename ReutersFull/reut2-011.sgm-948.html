	<h3>kenya's economy will continue to expand this year and the government will do more to encourage investment by foreign firms and the local private sector, planning minister robert ouko said.     he told a news conference that the government would soon create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment applications by local and foreign investors.     praising the role of multinational companies and local entrepreneurs in kenya's economy, the minister promised to maintain a close working contact with the private sector.     the economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in 1985, ouko said. this was owing to high prices for the country's coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes, he added.     "despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices, kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987," the planning minister said.     agriculture would expand significantly if favourable weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises announced in february, the minister added.     kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the long rainy season, which is due to start about now.     ouko said the production of kenya's main cash crops increased during the second half of last year.     coffee deliveries to the state-run coffee board of kenya rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
