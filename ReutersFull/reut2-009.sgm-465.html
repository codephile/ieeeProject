	<h3>a british voter opinion poll in tomorrow's today newspaper shows a surge in support for the centrist alliance grouping and a fall for both the ruling conservatives and the labour opposition party.     the marplan poll gives the conservatives 36 pct, the liberal/social democratic alliance 31 pct, and labour 31 pct as well. a marplan survey last month gave the tories 38 pct, the alliance 21 pct, and labour 37 pct.     the latest poll would, if translated into an election result, produce a hung parliament, analysts said. that should dampen speculation of an early june election, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
