	<h3>the new british one ounce gold coin, the "britannia," will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the day of purchase plus a "competitive premium," treasury officials said.     value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members of the u.k. public, as is currently the case with foreign coins, although transactions between members of the london gold market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. no decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins.     although a number of gold coins, especially the canadian maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the place of the south african krugerrand, the british government still feels that there is a gap in the market for a british one ounce gold coin. the only british gold coin available at present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold.     gold from south africa or the soviet union will not be used in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be bought on the world gold market. but analysts said it would be difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases.     no details are yet available on how many coins will be issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price.     there were some enquiries on the "britannia" from coin dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put off many investors, traders said.     some said that the "britannia" had come too late, with the canadian maple leaf, the american eagle and other gold coins already well established.  reuter &#3;</h3>
