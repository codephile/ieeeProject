	<h3>the world bank said it has approved a 140 mln dlr loan for india to help lessen that country's dependence on imported oil and spur development of its own petroleum resources.     the bank said the loan will be used to boost production by injecting gas in the partially depleted assam oil fields and to assist exploration in other areas, including drilling 10 exploratory wells.     the bank said the recipient of the 20-year loan will be oil india ltd (oil), which is the smaller of two public indian petroleum exploration and production companies.  reuter &#3;</h3>
