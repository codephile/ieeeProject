	<h3>new england electric system's auditors have again qualified the utility's annual report because of uncertainty about whether its oil and gas subsidiary can recover its investments.     the qualification was noted in the annual report which new england electric released at a security analysts meeting today. the auditors also qualified the company's 1985 report for the same reason, noting the sharp drop in oil and gas prices in early 1986.     president samuel huntington told analysts the utility will have to take a write-down of about 235 mln dlrs if federal regulators do not allow the company to pass on the losses cited by the accountants to its rate payers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
