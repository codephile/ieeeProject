	<h3>figures for first quarter 1987 west german gnp will be published on june 11 after they were provisionally scheduled for june 4, an official at the federal statistics office said.     the official said there had been a delay in gathering information for the data, which are expected to show that the west german economy contracted in the period.     a spokesman for the economics ministry in bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on june 11, the day after the venice economic summit ends.     "there is no political motivation. it is a purely technical matter," he added.     the west german government is expected to come under pressure in venice from both the u.s. and its european partners to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.     however, government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.     helmut schlesinger, vice-president of the west german central bank, the bundesbank, said in tokyo today that gnp, the widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.      the government has confirmed that growth was negative in the first 1987 quarter. but year-on-year growth is expected to be about two pct.     schlesinger today repeated the bundesbank's reluctance to cut its official interest rates further. its key discount rate, at three pct, is just above historical lows.     west german officials are likely to emphasise at the venice summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad, is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years.     the government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback.     it expects gnp growth for the whole of 1987 of just under two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
