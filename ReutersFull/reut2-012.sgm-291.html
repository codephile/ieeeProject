	<h3>bankamerica corp said it placed its 1.9 billion dlrs in medium- and long-term term loans to the brazilian public and private sectors on non-accrual status as of march 31.     as a result, the bank's net income for the first quarter will be reduced by about 40 mln dlrs. if brazil's suspension of interest payments remains in effect, earnings for the whole year will be reduced by a further 100 mln dlrs.     bankamerica said, however, that it expects to report a profit for the first quarter of 1987.     bankamerica also said that it had placed 180 mln dlrs of loans to ecuador on non-accrual, which will reduce first-quarter earnings by about five mln dlrs.     if no interest payments are received for the rest of the year from ecuador, which is recovering from a severe earthquake, 1987 earnings will be cut by a further 10 mln dlrs.     but, "barring substantialy increased instabilities in developing countries," bankamerica said it continues to anticipate an operating profit in 1987.     in the first quarter of 1986 bankamerica earned a profit of 63 mln dlrs but turned in a loss of 518 mln dlrs for the year as a whole.     bankamerica also said it completed yesterday the previously announced sale of its discount brokerage subsidiary, charles schwab corp. the sale was part of a program of asset disposals undertaken to staunch losses at the nation's second largest bank holding company.     bankamerica stressed that it expects brazil will eventually reach a debt rescheduling agreement which will provide for the payment of interest being deferred in 1987.     "negotiations will be complicated and lengthy, but we continue to expect that a rescheduling agreement will be completed this year," said a.w. clausen, bankamerica's chairman and chief executive officer.     "for the interim period, however, we concluded that the responsible procedure would be to record income only as we receive payments on the loans," he added in a statement.     u.s. banks are not legally required to place loans on non-accrual until interest becomes more than 90 days overdue.     by striking accrued, but unpaid, interest from their accounts earlier than necessary, the banks are signalling to brazil their readiness to dig in for a long fight over the terms of the rescheduling agreement regardless of the short-term earnings impact, banking analysts said.     brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt in february, citing a drop in official reserves, and said interest payments would be held on deposit at the central bank pending a rescheduling.     it also froze some 16 billion dlrs of short term credit lines which banks were committed to provide until march 31.  reuter &#3;</h3>
