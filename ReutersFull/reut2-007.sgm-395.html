	<h3>the united auto workers has set a march 26 strike deadline at general motors corp's pontiac, mich., truck and bus plant, a uaw spokesman said.     the spokesman said in response to an inquiry that the 9,000 uaw-represented workers at the facility will walk off the job at noon (est) next thursday if an agreement is not reached by that time.     "we will be on strike. if the workers are still in there, they will come out," the spokesman, reginald mcghee, said.     the union earlier said it today notified gm of its intent to authorize a strike at the pontiac facility.     the uaw gave gm what it calls a "five-day letter," which gives the company five days to come to an agreement before workers go on strike. the letter was effective at noon today. weekend days are not included in the five-day period, mcghee said.     the spokesman could not say what the chances were for a settlement. "at this point, it's too early to say" whether the plant will be struck, mcghee said.     the uaw earlier said the strike notification is expected to "trigger an intensive effort to resolve disputed issues."     talks between the uaw local at the plant, local 594, and gm officials were continuing today over disputed contract issues, including the main issue of whether the company can subcontract jobs to non-union workers.     mcghee said the two sides are also discussing health and safety matters and relief time.  reuter &#3;</h3>
