	<h3>the chicago mercantile exchange's board of the directors has decided to drop a proposal to place a limit on daily price movements of its standard and poor's 500 futures contract, cme president william brodsky said.     brodsky told the futures industry association that the exchange's board decided tuesday to withdraw the proposal, which aimed to quell price volatility in the popular contract.     he said the proposal to establish a one-year pilot program had generated much negative reaction among users of the contract and that the cftc "was not comfortable" with the plan.     "now, given the cftc's posture on our filing, we feel the negatives outweigh the positives," brodsky said.     brodsky said market users were concerned that limits could "become self-fulfilling because they could force sales to (allow users to) avoid becoming locked into the market."     he also said the board was concerned that the one-year pilot price limit might become permanent. "rules when put in place sometimes don't come off," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
