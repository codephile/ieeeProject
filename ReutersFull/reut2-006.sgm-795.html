	<h3>the 25-nation latin american economic system (sela) has presented a document calling for a new strategy to cope with latin america's crushing debt and faltering growth.     sela presented the document to a week-long conference of latin american financial and economic experts, meeting to lay the groundwork for this year's annual meeting of the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad).     sela called for new efforts to break "the vicious circle of debt, stagnation and productive retrogression the region has been immersed in since the beginning of the decade."     the alterantives to existing approaches for dealing with the region's crushing foreign debt must include greater concessions from creditors, according to sela.     radical concessions such as debt writedowns and schemes to tie payments to real income must all be considered, the sela document stresses.     it notes that other favorable strategies include foreign investment/debt equity swaps, already successfully experimented with in some countries.     other policies recommended include more realistic exhange rates and more producive capital investment programs.     the sela document is expected to be approved by delegates from all 26 latin american and caribbean nations meeting here until friday.     it will be submitted again for approval by developing nations belonging to the so-called group of 77 scheduled to meet next month in havana, cuba.     at the havana meeting delegates from latin america, asia and africa will attempt to hammer out a common position for presentation at unctad's annal meeting next july in geneva.  reuter &#3;</h3>
