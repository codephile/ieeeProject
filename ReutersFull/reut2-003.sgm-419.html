	<h3>cts corp said it increased its 1986 loss from continuing operations to 26.6 mln dlrs from the previously announced 23.8 mln dlrs loss.     the 1986 figure was increased to include expenses involved with its settlement of a dispute with dynamics corp of america <dya>.     the settlement involved a takeover bid for cts by dynamics corp, which had offered to buy the shares of cts that it did not already own.     cts made a profit of 7.9 mln dlrs from continuing operations in 1985.     cts said it charged an additional 2.8 mln dlrs in special expenses to its 1986 operations as a result of the dynamics corp settlement.     the additional expenses include the obligation to reimburse dynamics corp, subject to approval of cts shareholders, a total of 2.1 mln dlrs for dynamics corp's expenses and other costs relating to cts.  reuter &#3;</h3>
