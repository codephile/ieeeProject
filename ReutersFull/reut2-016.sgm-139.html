	<h3>morgan crucible co plc <mgcr.l> said the prospects for 1987 were encouraging, with orders and sales significantly up on last year in all divisions.     it said there were good opportunities for growth in both existing and recently acquired businesses as well as for growth by acquisition in related areas.     it earlier announced a 6.1 mln stg rise in pre-tax profit to 24.8 mln stg for the year to december 28. turnover rose to 242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.     most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in the u.s., u.k. and australian economies in the first half.     currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one mln stg, it noted.     morgan said although profits in the electronics sector improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results were nonetheless disappointing.     sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed defence orders and cancellations. however, it said it had taken the necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was now proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.     morgan shares firmed two pence to 318p at 0905 gmt from 316p at friday's close.  reuter &#3;</h3>
