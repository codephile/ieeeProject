	<h3>deputy finance ministers from the group of 10 leading western industrialised countries met here to discuss the world debt crisis, trade imbalances and currency stability today following last month's paris monetary accord, sources close to the talks said.     the officials met at the offices of the international monetary fund (imf) to discuss broad aspects of world monetary policy in preparation for the imf's interim committee meeting in washington in april.     the talks were the first high-level international review of the monetary situation since the accord last month reached by the u.s., west germany, france, britain, japan and canada to stabilise world currency markets at around present levels following the 40 pct slide in the dollar since mid-1985.     other countries represented at today's talks were italy, which refused to attend last month's meeting on the grounds that it was being excluded from the real discussions, the netherlands, belgium and switzerland.     many of the officials had met earlier today and yesterday within the framework of the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) to review the slow progress being made in cutting the record 170 billion dlr u.s. trade deficit and persuading west germany and japan to open their economies to more foreign imports.  reuter &#3;</h3>
