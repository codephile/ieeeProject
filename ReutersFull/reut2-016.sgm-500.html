	<h3>the dollar straight sector of the eurobond market ended lower after another nervous day's trading, with many operators keeping to the sidelines ahead of tomorrow's u.s. trade figures for february, dealers said. prices of longer dated issues ended 1/2 or 5/8 point lower, while short dates were 1/8 to 3/8 point easier.     bonds for texaco inc units hardly traded during the day following the weekend news that the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in another twist to its long running dispute with pennzoil co, dealers added.     the chapter 11 filing means that texaco will not be paying interest on its eurobonds. dealers in the straight bonds noted that the market in them had been basis only for some time prior to the weekend's news. "it wasn't a true market, someone asked you a price and you just gave them an idea," one said.     however, the company's convertible bonds had been trading since the company's share price provided a benchmark to which dealers could establish a proper price level. the company has two actively traded convertibles outstanding, a 500 mln dlr bond due 1994 which pays 11-3/4 pct and a one billion dlr deal, also due 1994, paying 11-7/8 pct.     traders even disagreed about last week's closing levels for the convertible bonds, but a median appeared to be around 97 to 99 pct. today, one trader said they were indicated initially at 65 to 70 pct before ending at some 79 83 pct.     but he added, "that's only an idea. there's no real market today. i've dealt once during the day, i'm not going to say at what level." other dealers were reluctant even to give an indication of the bonds' levels.     dealers said the market in all texaco deals will almost certainly remain on an indicated, or negotiated, basis until the events of the weekend are further clarified.     the primary market had a steady day, with the australian dollar and the yen sectors again seeing the most activity, dealers said. deutsche bank finance nv curacao became the first of three issuers in the australian dollar market during the morning with a 100 mln dlr bond due 1990 paying 14-1/8 pct and priced at 100-1/4 pct.     the issue was lead managed by deutsche bank capital markets (dbcm) and guaranteed by deutsche bank itself. a dbcm official said the firm had placed 60 mln australian dlrs of the issue itself and quoted the deal at less one less 7/8 pct, comfortably inside the 1-1/2 pct total fees.     the state bank of victoria issued a 50 mln australian dlr bond paying 14-1/2 pct over three years and priced at 101-3/8 pct. commerzbank ag was sole manager for the deal, which was offered on one broker screen at less 1-1/2 pct.     the day's other borrower in this sector was the new south wales treasury corporation guaranteed by the crown-in-right of new south wales. the five year bond pays 14-1/4 pct and was priced at 101-7/8 pct.     lead manager was county natwest capital markets. it was quoted at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct, inside the two pct total fees.     secondary market australian dlr bonds ended little changed on the day, with dealers saying that operators are awaiting the australian trade figures for march. a deficit of some 800 mln to one billion dlrs was expected by one house active in the sector.     union bank of switzerland (securities) ltd lead managed a 15 billion yen bond for union bank of switzerland nv. the five year deal pays 4-3/8 pct and features a put and call option at par after four years.     priced at 101-5/8 pct, the issue was quoted at less 1-1/4 pct bid on the grey market compared with the total fees of 1-5/8 pct.     ente nazionale per l'energia elettrica issued a 15 billion yen bond due 1994 at 4-3/4 pct and priced at 101-7/8 pct. the deal was quoted on the 1-7/8 pct total fees.     elsewhere, alza corp issued a 75 mln dlr convertible bond due 2002 through merrill lynch capital markets. the par priced issue has an indicated coupon of between 5-1/2 and 5-3/4 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
