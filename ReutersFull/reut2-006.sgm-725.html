	<h3>carolina power and light co said its board has decided to cancel coal-fired mayo unit two, the second unit planned for its mayo plant in person county, n.c.     the company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in 1992.     carolina power said the status of the unit had been under review because of a decision by the north carolina environmental management commission that would have required the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing scrubbers.     carolina power said unit one, which has been in operation since 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers through the use of low-sulphur coal, and "the addition of scrubbers to mayo unit two would have produced only marginal air quality improvements."     the company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost power from duke power co <duk> for intermediate and peaking purposes than the projected cost of power from mayo two with scrubbers.  it said it will retain the mayo two site for later development of a generating unit.     carolina power said mayo two was projected to cost about 877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  "the higher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would increase the cost of power produced by mayo unit two with scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year."     a company spokesman said the company has already spent about 23 mln dlrs on mayo two. he said no estimate has yet been made of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company does not expect to take a charge against earnings.  he said carolina power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings it will make late this year or early next year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
