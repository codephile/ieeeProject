	<h3>british petroleum co plc's announcement that its u.s. subsidiary intends to tender for the 45 pct of standard oil co <srd> it does not already own, catapulted u.s. oil stocks sharply higher this morning, traders and analysts said.     "it raises the specter of additional consolidation in the industry and that is what is boosting the other oils," analyst rosario ilacqua of l.f. rothschild said.     sanford margoshes of shearson lehman brothers said "this deal shows that british petroleum, a conservative investor that knows the oil business, is clearly confident in the u.s. oil industry, and that shines well on the u.s. companies."     philips petroleum <p> gained 3/4 to 15-7/8, occidental petroleum <oxy> one to 34-5/8, usx corp <x>, with its marathon oil co unit, rose 1/2 to 28-3/8. exxon <xon> climbed one to 88-3/8, mobil <mob> one to 50-1/4, atlantic richfield <arc> 3-1/8 to 80-1/2, amoco <an> 1-7/8 to 84-1/8, and amerada hess one to 33-5/8. bp gained 2-3/8 to 59-3/4.     both analysts said the rise in standard's price this morning to above the proposed tender price of 70 dlrs a share, is an indication that investors expect the bid to be sweetened. standard gained 6-3/4 to 71-5/8.     the analysts cited royal dutch/shell group's <rd> <sc> bid for shell oil co, which was sweetened before its successful conclusion.     margoshes said the bp action "is an articulation of the underlying value of oil companies in the marketplace." but he expressed skepticism that this will necessarily lead to heightened merger or buyout activity in the oil group.  reuter &#3;</h3>
