	<h3>the <queensland press ltd> (qpl) board said it unanimously recommended the one billion dlr takeover bid by <cruden investments pty ltd>, a family company of news corp ltd <ncpa.s> chief executive rupert murdoch.     the 23 dlrs a share cash-only offer is nearly double the market price before news announced its now-completed bid for the herald and weekly times ltd <hwta.s> in early december and no other offer is likely, it said in a statement.     independent adviser, <wardley australia ltd>, had also concluded the offer was fair and reasonable, it added.     qpl is already owned 48.3 pct by hwt.  reuter &#3;</h3>
