	<h3>duff and phelps said it lowered its ratings on outstanding notes and debentures of transco energy company and its subsidiary transcontinental gas pipe line company, affecting 887 mln dlrs in debt securities.     transco energy cumulative convertible preferred stock was lowered to dp-12 (middle bb) from dp-10 (low bbb) and transcontinental gas pipe line notes and debentures were lowered to dp-10 from dp-8 (high bbb) and preferred stock to dp-11 (high bb) from dp-9 (middle bbb).     duff and phelps said the downgrade reflects an increase in transco's estimate of payments it will require to settle take-or-pay liabilities from 550 mln dlrs to 900 mln dlrs. transco has already made more than 400 mln dlrs in cash payments.     in addition, natural gas remains in excess supply and the ability of transcontinental to keep its pipeline full is subject to increaseing competition.                      reuter &#3;</h3>
