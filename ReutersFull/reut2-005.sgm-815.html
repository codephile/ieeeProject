	<h3>the belgian government's new 150 billion franc, eight pct loan has been priced at par, a finance ministry spokesman said.      the eight-year loan features a call option after four years at 102, falling to 101-1/2 after five years and by half a point each year thereafter.     the conditions are the same as those on the most recent public authority loan stock issue, for the state road building fund fonds des routes.     some 120 billion francs of the loan will be taken up by members of the issuing consortium, comprising major commercial banks, and the remaining 30 billion by publicly-owned credit institutions.  reuter &#3;</h3>
