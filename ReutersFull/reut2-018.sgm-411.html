	<h3>cominco ltd has no contract negotiations scheduled this week with any of the five striking locals at the trail smelter and kimberley lead-zinc mine, union spokesmen said.     however, leaders of the negotiating teams are trying to set up an informal meeting to discuss the stalemate, said john owens, spokesman for united steelworkers of america local 480, which is one of three locals that represents 2,600 production and maintenance workers.     owens also said cominco has said the strike is costing it five mln canadian dlrs a day in debt service costs that are not covered by revenue. he said the company has not estimated total lost revenue and cominco spokesmen were not immediately available for comment.     the strike, which began may nine, also involves two locals that represent 600 office and technical workers.     the production and maintenance workers three weeks ago rejected a tentative three-year agreement that provided cost of living adjustments but no basic wage increase.     each of the five locals has a separate contract that expired april 30, but the main issues are similar.     the trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead last year. the sullivan mine at kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at the trail smelter.  reuter &#3;</h3>
