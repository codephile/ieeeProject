	<h3>expediters international of washington inc president john kaiser told securities analysts business in the current quarter is good and he is looking for good results for the year.     kaiser, however, declined to make specific earnings projections.  in 1986, the company reported earnings of 4.1 mln dlrs, or 73 cts a share, on sales 108.8 mln dlrs.     "the second quarter looks good and it looks like we're going to have a good year," he said, citing strength in imports and exports in the pacific rim.     kaiser also said a pickup in electronics and computer business would help this year's results.     the company is trying to get a license to operate directly in korea before next year's olympics, he said. it currently works through an agent there.     he said four countries in the pacific - hong kong, korea, taiwan and singapore, where the company does much if its business - should have economic growth of more than 10 pct over the next two to four years. "the pacific rim will still be our strongest market," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
