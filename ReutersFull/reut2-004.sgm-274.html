	<h3>the federal reserve is not expected to intervene in the government securities market today, several economists said.     they said the fed does not have a much of an adding need this week and may wait until tomorrow or monday before supplying reserves.     but a few economists said there was an outside chance that the fed may inject reserves indirectly via a small round of customer repurchase agreements.     federal funds hovered at 6-1/8 pct this morning after averaging 6.32 pct yesterday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
