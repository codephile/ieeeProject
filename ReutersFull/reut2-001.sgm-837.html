	<h3>the reagan administration officially submitted to congress its proposals to cut back u.s. farmers' income deficiency payments, decouple planting decisions from income support levels and accelerate reductions in loan rates, senate staff said.     the recommendations, first outlined last january in president reagan's fiscal 1988 budget blueprint, were transmitted to both houses of congress as legislative proposals.     it was not clear which lawmakers might introduce the measures.     the most controversial proposal in the package would make 10 pct annual reductions in target prices for major commodities. a number of legislators have predicted the target price proposal will not move in congress.     the package also would offer the so-called 0/92 option to producers of 1987-90 crops and raise the annual permissible reduction in loan rates to 10 pct from 5 pct.     under 0/92, a producer is guaranteed at least 92 pct of his deficiency payment regardless of how much he plants.  reuter &#3;</h3>
