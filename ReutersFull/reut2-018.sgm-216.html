	<h3>the quebec government said it joined with b.f. goodrich canada inc to study the feasability of building a vinyl chloride monomer plant in montreal. the plant would supply manufacturers of pvc construction and other materials in eastern canada and the northeastern u.s., government officials said.     theys said the  plant would cost about 125 mln canadian dlrs, with production beginning in 1991 if economic conditions are right. more     the quebec government has said it wants the project to proceed because it would provide future demand for petromont inc petrochemical products. petromont is jointly owned by union carbide canada ltd <ucc.to> and the quebec government's sgf industrial development group. its montreal plant would provide ethylene as a raw material for the project.      quebec said it also wants interprovincial pipe line ltd <ipipf.o> to adapt its pipeline from sarnia, ont., to montreal to carry natural gas liquids, a decision that will be made by the federal national energy board. it said the pipeline could provide petromont with feedstock at one-third the cost of moving it by rail.  reuter &#3;</h3>
