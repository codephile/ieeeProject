	<h3>steel output in the major non-communist producing countries fell sharply in february, continuing a long-running trend, international iron and steel institute figures showed.     production in the 30 countries which report their figures to it was 6.9 pct below the february 1986 level at 32.03 mln tonnes.     output in the united states fell 18.5 pct to 5.30 mln tonnes, that in japan 7.8 pct to 7.27 mln and that in the european community 6.5 pct to 9.91 mln.     the figures continue to indicate a switch away from these traditional major producing countries to the more advanced developing countries.     brazilian february output rose 9.2 pct from year-earlier levels to 1.73 mln tonnes and that in south korea was up 7.5 pct at 1.17 mln tonnes.     the 30 countries covered by the figures account for about 97 pct of world non-communist steel production, the institute said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
