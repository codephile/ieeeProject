	<h3>jacobs suchard ag expects a world cocoa surplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a 104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, jens sroka, head of commodity buying, told a news conference.     the company expects prices to remain at around current levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock rules at the forthcoming london cocoa talks, and believes market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise prices.     sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement.     sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a continued build-up in stocks.     the recent failure of the london coffee talks had surprised market observers.     unless reason prevails and the major producers return to the conference table, the world coffee market will remain free and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, sroka added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
