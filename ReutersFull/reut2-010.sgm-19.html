	<h3>exovir inc said the european patent office notified it that its application covering combinations of nonionic surfactants and all forms of interferon has been approved and a patent will be issued in about six months.     exovir is completing trials of a gel combining alpha interferon and nonoxynol-9, an antiviral surfactant, as a treatment for genital and oral herpes and genital warts. the gel was given a u.s. patent in 1985.     it said clinical tests will begin shortly to test whether the gel is effective in preventing transmission of the aids virus when used with a condom.  reuter &#3;</h3>
