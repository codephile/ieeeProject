	<h3>the sharp fall in international coffee prices will not affect colombia's external credit situation, finance minister cesar gaviria told reuters.     he said the current depression on world coffee markets was not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on colombia's financial state which he described as sound.     "our foreign debt is high, but we can pay and i hope the foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us," he said.     colombia, the only major latin american country not to have rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt of 13.6 billion dlrs.     calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week from the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade union following the coffee price drop. gaviria said lower coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987.     gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-american bank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of 3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years, which he said was approved.  reuter &#3;</h3>
