	<h3>the coffee, sugar and cocoa exchange amended regulations governing expanded trading limits on coffee, cocoa and sugar contracts to provide uniformity.     effective today, the exchange will permit normal daily price limits in those commodities to expand whenever the first two limited contract months move the limit in the same direction for two consecutive sessions.     the normal daily limits will be reinstated once the first two limited deliveries close by less than the normal limit for two successive trading days.     previously exchange rules required the first three limited months to move the limit in coffee and cocoa. it had required the first two limited sugar deliveries to make such moves for three consecutive sessions.  reuter &#3;</h3>
