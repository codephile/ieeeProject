	<h3>spain's minas de almaden y arrayanes s.a. said it will host a conference of mercury producers here at the end of april to study how to stimulate low mercury prices.     last week, almaden and algerian producer enof agreed to establish a minimum price of 300 dlrs per flask (34.5 kilos) for spot mercury sales, up from the previous minimum of 240 dlrs.     a minas de almaden statement said the non-communist world's main mercury producers had decided not to sign any contracts using the reference price of specialist publications, because it was well below their costs of production.  reuter &#3;</h3>
