	<h3>the soviet union has agreed to cut its coking coal export prices to japanese steel mills by about five dlrs a tonne in 1987/88 starting april 1 in exchange for an increase in export volume, industry sources said.     the prices were set at 44 dlrs a tonne for neryungrinsky coal and at 43.80 dlrs for kuznetsky coal, fob.     japan will import a total of 4.9 mln tonnes from both areas, up from 4.2 mln a year earlier, they said.     the steelmakers had asked moscow to agree to a cutback to 3.7 mln tonnes in 1987/88, but the soviet union urged japan to increase the amount to 6.5 mln, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
