	<h3>u.s. attorney for manhattan rudolph giuliani, who has been leading a major probe into government corruption and the mafia, said he was offered a top job at the securities and exchange commission.     but added he had no plans to take that job.     newspaper reports have said giuliani was offered the chairmanship of the sec, but he declined to say what position he was offered at the federal agency.     speaking to reporters after a press conference called to announce the corruption indictment of a former city official, giuliani said he had talks at the white house with chief of staff howard baker last month about the sec.     "right now i am still here. i have no intention of leaving....this is not a good time for me to leave. i have a few more months of work to do and i don't think they should hold a job open for me," giuliani said in a reference to the ongoing probes his office is conducting into new york city corruption and the mafia.     he added that he also had feelers from two people as to whether he would be interested in the fbi director's post and said he informed them that he was not interested.  reuter &#3;</h3>
