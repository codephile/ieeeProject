	<h3>venezuela will shortly announce a new plan to allow private companies to repay their foreign debts with equity and for public debt to be converted into private sector investments, cntral bank president hernan anzola said.     anzola told a meeting of the banking association yesterday the new plan, to be called exchange agreement no. 4, will be announced in mid-april.     he said it will allow foreign creditors to convert unpaid private sector debts into bolivar-denominated shares of stock in the debtor companies. the plan would be similar to those already in effect in other latin american nations, he said.     at least a half dozen such debt-equity swaps have already taken place in venezuela. in 1984, a group of 17 u.s. banks led by citibank converted 18.3 mln dlrs of debt from the cervecera nacional, into 30 pct of the beer company'stock.     anzola said exchange agreement no. 4 will also allow for conversion of public sector debt into investments in venezuelan private industry.     holders of venezuelan public debt bonds would be able to exchange them for bolivar-denominated bonds at up to 100 pct of their nominal value, which could be turned into private investment in priority areas.     this, anzola said, would mean a reduction in the amount of the public sector debt and an increase in foreign investment. he stressed that the public sector debt bonds will not be exchanged for shares of stock in state-owned companies.     anzola said exchange rates for these transactions will depend the type of investment the creditor intends to make, with export-oriented companies to be favored.     venezuela issued a new plan in december for the repayment of 7.8 billion dlrs in private sector foreign debt. under the scheme, debtors are able to buy dollars at the preferential 7.50 bolivars rate, but must also pay a premium.  reuter &#3;</h3>
