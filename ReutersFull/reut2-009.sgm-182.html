	<h3>chinese premier zhao ziyang said the threat from western political ideas which caused widespread student demonstrations last december has been curbed.     in an address at the opening session of china's parliament, the national people's congress, he accused unnamed party leaders of being weak and lax in their supervision of ideology and of failing to give full support to the promotion of marxism.     "after several months of work since the end of last year we have curbed bourgeois liberalisation, which was once quite widespread," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
