	<h3>loans and advances from the dutch central bank to the commercial banks rose by 1.2 billion guilders to 10.7 billion in the week up to and including april 6, the bank's weekly return showed.     paper discounted with the bank also rose, by 477 mln guilders to 916 mln.     these rises were balanced by a 1.6 billion guilders rise in the treasury's account at the bank, made up mainly of repayments on housing loans by local authorities.  the treasury's account stood at 8.1 billion guilders, the weekly return showed.     the bank's gold and currency reserves rose by 484 mln to 56.89 billion guilders, while the value of non-gold holdings rose by 140 mln guilders, analysts said.     they added that the rise in the reserves was merely the result of commercial currency transactions by the bank.     call money and period tariffs were only fractionally changed this week and were seen sustaining their stable levels since no dramatic changes in the money market debt, currently around 10.25 billion guilders, are expected.     today call money traded between 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct and period tariffs all between 5-5/16 to 5-7/16 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
