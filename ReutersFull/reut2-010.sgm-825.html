	<h3>walbro corp said it expects its first-quarter results to reach "all-time highs."     it projected sales exceeding 32 mln dlrs, or up 21 pct from the 26,488,000 dlrs reported for the 1986 first quarter. it said the previous high for a single quarter was 27,179,000 dlrs for the 1986 fourth quarter.     walbro estimated income for the quarter will exceed first-quarter 1986 income, which was 1,953,000 dlrs, or 66 cts a share, by at least 40 pct. it said the first quarter of 1986 had been the previous income record for a single quarter.     walbro cited strong demand for its fuel systems products, especially automotive electronic fuel injection components and carburetors for lawn and garden applications.     however, it said it is unlikely the company will sustain the same record pace of sales and income throughout 1987, due to an expected reduction in throttle body sales.     "it now appears likely that the company's throttle body business with general motors corp <gm> will peak in the first six months of 1987, continue at reduced levels to july 1988 and suffer an interruption for the period from july 1988 to july 1989," walbro added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
