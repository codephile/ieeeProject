	<h3>britain's ruling conservatives maintained a commanding lead in a new opinion poll, reinforcing views that prime minister margaret thatcher is poised to call a general election in june.     the harris poll published in the observer newspaper gave the conservatives the support of 42 pct of those questioned, labour 31 pct, and the liberal-social democratic alliance trailing with 25 pct.     this would give the conservatives a 94-seat overall majority in the house of commons.  reuter &#3;</h3>
