	<h3>the senate agriculture committee voted to limit changes in county loan rate differentials starting with the 1988 crop as part of a budget deficit reduction package.     the panel also approved measures that could trigger larger corn and wheat acreage reduction requirements, increase farmer-held reserve storage payments, reduce a potential milk support price cut, and require advance deficiency payments for producers of major crops.     a proposal to require imported tropical oils be labeled on u.s. food products failed by a 10-8 vote.  reuter &#3;</h3>
