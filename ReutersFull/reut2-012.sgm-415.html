	<h3>taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered about 3.4 billion u.s. dlrs in exchange rate losses from july 1986 to february 1987 as a result of the rise of the taiwan dollar against the u.s. currency.     yu chien-ming, head of the government statistics department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to increase as the taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.     the taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the u.s. dollar today, has risen about 16 pct against the u.s. unit since september 1985. some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by june and to 32 by the end of this year.     taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion dlrs. at end-february they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's third largest after west germany and japan.     yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled about 1.68 billion u.s. dlrs from july 1986 to february 1987. the reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at about 170 leading banks in the u.s., japan, britain, canada and singapore.     about 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash, mostly in u.s. dollars. the rest are in government treasury bills, certificates of deposit and bonds.  reuter &#3;</h3>
