	<h3>president reagan said he was pleased with the actions of some banks to reduce their prime lending rates today and said he sees room for a further decline in interest rates.     "i believe there is room in the market for a further decline in interest rates," reagan said in a statement as he left the white house to visit his wife nancy at bethesda naval hospital.     reagan's statement followed a meeting with his top economic advisers.     reagan said he remains concerned about the market, but that actions taken by the federal reserve have helped.     "interest rates are down across the spectrum," reagan said.     "specifically, i am pleased that the bond market is strong and that foreign exchange markets are stable," reagan said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
