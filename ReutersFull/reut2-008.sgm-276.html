	<h3>the inter-american development bank said it intended this year to match the over three billion dollars it lent to latin america in 1986 despite growing pressures on its capital.     in its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, the bank made it clear, however, that the latin countries needed vast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen their ailing economies in the period ahead.     the report said that latin america continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession that began in the early 1980s, with gross domestic product (gdp) edging up to nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.     the report said the region's improved economic growth last year was based on a rise in internal demand and fuller utilization of previously underused production capacity.     "this situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 and beyond because no significant new investments are being made," the report said.     the bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling 3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to 35.44 billion dlrs.     of last year's loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actually disbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
