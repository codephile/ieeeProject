	<h3>commodity futures trading commission, cftc, chairman susan phillips said the agency opposed efforts to set up a federal regulatory framework over futures and options margins.     phillips told the national grain and feed association yesterday that futures margins are best set by the exchanges.     earlier this year securities and exchange commission chairman john shad suggested that futures volatility might be dampened if federal regulators could set margins.     phillips predicted congress would discuss the issue in the context of program trading of stock index futures and options.  reuter &#3;</h3>
