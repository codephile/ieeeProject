	<h3>bankamerica corp chairman a.w. clausen said he believes brazil will successfully restructure its foreign debt sometime this year, but in the meantime that country's creditors could suffer somwehat over the short term.     he also said brazil's decision to suspend foreign debt payments is most likely a move aimed at strengthening its negotiating position.     "i believe it was a posturing move on the part of the country," clausen said.     clausen made his comments during an address at a chamber of commerce luncheon here.     last month brazil, which has about 110 billion dlrs of foreign debt, suspended payment on some 68 billion dlrs owned to private banks while it worked out its economic problems.     bankamerica has some 2.74 billion dlrs in loans outstanding to brazil.     clausen also said he did not think any financial institutions would be "done in" by brazil's suspension of debt payments and he added "i do not believe the international monetary fund will come to a roaring halt."  reuter &#3;</h3>
