	<h3>the european commission is to consider proposed new higher minimum standards for sales of durum wheat into intervention stores, european community sources said.     they said a document drawn up by commission officials proposes a reduction in the maximum humidity level to 13 pct from 14, an increase in the minimum weight to 78 kilos per hectolitre from 76, a tightening of other technical standards and introduction of some new ones.     current public stocks of durum wheat in the ec are 1.15 mln tonnes, of which almost 1.12 mln are in italy.  reuter &#3;</h3>
