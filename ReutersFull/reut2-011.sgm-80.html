	<h3>rjr nabisco inc said it is unlikely that it will spin off any of its tobacco operations into a master limited partnership in the "immediately foreseeable future."     but the company, which has said was studying proposals to transfer at least a portion of its tobacco business to a master limited partnership, said in a 10-k filing that it will continue "on an ongoing basis to study all aspects of the business, including the role, if any, of an mlp, with a view toward maximizing shareholder value."     f. ross johnson, president and chief operating officer, said in a statement, "after careful study, we concluded that the possible benefits of an mlp do not at this time justify the management time and attention that would have to be devoted to the transfer to a new and difficult operating structure."     in february, rjr nabisco said it was studying a possible spinoff of its tobacco business to a master limited partnership. at that time, the company, which also has a large food business, said at that the tobacco business was not posting the same level of profits as its food operations.     a company spokesman said rjr nabisco will evaluate  a range of options for the tobacco business other than the formation of a master limited partnership. he declined, however, to say what those options might be.     the spokesman also refused to elaborate on what factors went into the company's decision not to spinoff the tobacco operations.  reuter &#3;</h3>
