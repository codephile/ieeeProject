	<h3>the european community launched an investigation into allegations of dumping by japanese semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark an intensification of world trade strains.     tokyo already faces a deadline of april 17 from washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the u.s.     the ec executive commission said today the european electrical component manufacturers association complained that japanese firms were selling high capacity eprom type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.     japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr ec eprom market, up from 60 pct in 1984. the ec firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the japanese.     the commission said it believed the association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified.     the commission claims last year's accord between the u.s. and japan on microchip pricing gives u.s. firms privileged access to the japanese market.  reuter &#3;</h3>
