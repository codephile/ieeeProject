	<h3>the financial times/stock exchange index of britain's 100 leading shares fell by its largest ever margin in points terms during a single session, dropping 46.1 to close at 2,002.5. the index earlier today touched a low of 1,993.7.     before today the largest one day points decline was a 35.8 point drop on february 9.     the index fall was triggered by fears a trade war could break out with japan following news the u.s. increased tariffs on japanese imports after the breakdown of a 1986 semiconductor pact. today's sharp sell off at the wall street opening gave selling momentum to a market which was already at its lows.  reuter &#3;</h3>
