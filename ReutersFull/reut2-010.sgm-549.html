	<h3>moody's investors service inc said that it downgraded gelco corp's variable rate notes and convertible debentures to ba-3 from ba-2.     it also lowered the ratings of gelco unit cti international inc's senior debt to ba-3 from ba-2 and cti's subordinated debt to b-2 from b-1. about 486 mln dlrs if affected.     moody's said the changes reflect the reduced levels of debt protection resulting from gelco's restructuring efforts. moody's said it is not adjusting gelco's b-2 subordinated debt rating because it remains an appropriate assessment of risk.  reuter &#3;</h3>
