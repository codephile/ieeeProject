	<h3>lumber futures fell for losses of as much as 3.50 dlrs per tbf, basis may, after starting 0.80 lower to 0.10 higher.     lack of carryover demand and pressure associated with the lower trend to financial futures early touched off some stop loss orders. futures fell to near technical support before recovering slightly, traders said.     some pressure also stemmed from a quiet cash market and erroding cash prices, they said.     commission houses and locals sold on the break and offset scale-down buying by gnp, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
