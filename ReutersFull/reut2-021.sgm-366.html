	<h3>an iowa state university study showed pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by long-established u.s. department of agriculture statistics, the national pork producers council (nppc) said.     six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below american heart association guidelines for recommended foods. eighty pct of all the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained less than six pct fat, the nppc said.     meanwhile, usda handbook 8-10 - long used as the established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the nppc said.     robin kline, a dietitian and director of consumer affairs for the nppc said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy between the study and the usda handbook.     "handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. the statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago, thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices," kline said.     the study, funded by nppc with producer checkoff money, evaluated pork carcasses from 47 iowa producers in categories from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. researchers measured the fat content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat, moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.  reuter &#3;</h3>
