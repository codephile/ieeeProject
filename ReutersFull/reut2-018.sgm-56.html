	<h3>the decision by paul volcker not to serve a third term as chairman of the u.s. federal reserve board is a shock for financial markets and the world economy, hans mast, senior economic adviser to credit suisse first boston, said.     "the markets will believe there will be pressure for a more expansive policy (in the united states)," he said.     "i would say this is quite a shock for the world economy," he added. "he always stood for an anti-inflationary policy and tight fiscal discipline. he was one of the best central bankers america has had."     mast said the markets would now be trying to assess what sort of direction the fed would be taking under alan greenspan, designated to succeed volcker.     "greenspan is more of a politician than an academician, but the most important thing is that he has little experience in banking," mast said.     greenspan's first comments on being named were that the dollar appeared to have bottomed out but mast said that conviction would have to be backed by policy. "how can you say the dollar has bottomed out with the present level of current account deficits?" he said. "i would be sceptical."  reuter &#3;</h3>
