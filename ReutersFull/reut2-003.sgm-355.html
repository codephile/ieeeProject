	<h3>the chiefs of viacom international inc and <national amusements inc> said they met and agreed to work together to complete the previously announced merger of the two companies "as expeditiously as possible."     a spokeswoman for viacom declined to say if the executives had set a timetable for closing the deal.     viacom last week agreed to be acquired by national amusements for a combination of cash and stock with an estimated value of 53 dlrs a share, or a total of about 3.4 billion dlrs. &#3;</h3>
