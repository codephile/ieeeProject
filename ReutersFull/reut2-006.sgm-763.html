	<h3>a house banking subcommittee has approved legislation to limit the interest rates charged by banks and other credit card issuers.     the consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee bill would limit credit card interest rates at eight percentage points above the yield on one-year treasury securities.     if in effect now, the bill would limit credit card rates to 13.8 pct compared to a nation-wide average of 18 pct, the subcommittee said.     the bill now goes to the full house banking committee for further action.  reuter &#3;</h3>
