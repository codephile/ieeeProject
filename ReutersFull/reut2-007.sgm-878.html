	<h3><allied-lyons plc> sees rising profits from 51-pct-owned liquor producer hiram walker-gooderham and worts in the current fiscal year ending in early march, 1988, chairman derrick holden-brown said in a speech prepared for delivery to toronto analysts.     "we anticipate that hiram walker profits will be well above those of the plateau years," he said, referring to the four years up to 1985.     "in other words, we will have regained the 1985 position and improved on it," holden-brown said.     allied-lyons won control of hiram walker-gooderham last year in a battle against gulf canada corp, which finally got a 49 pct stake after an out-of-court settlement.     hiram walker resources ltd, the previous owner, reported liquor profits of 282 mln canadian dlrs in the fiscal year ending sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983, 294 mln in 1982 and 280 mln in 1981.     holden-brown said allied-lyons' financial results for the fiscal year just ended march seven would include three months of hiram walker-gooderham profits, but he did not provide actual figures.     he said hiram walker-gooderham's profit improvement in the current year will come from a previously announced reorganization put into effect march 1, 1987 and a close partnership with allied-lyons' existing allied vintners division.  reuter &#3;</h3>
