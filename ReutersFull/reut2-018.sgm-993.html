	<h3>strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern european countries in 1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the organisation for economic cooperation and development said.     in its semi-annual report, the oecd said portugal's total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption.     turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year.     in spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment, had been the driving force behind rapid growth in gross domestic product. both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong.     the oecd forecast that spanish imports would rise sharply next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the european community and declining competitiveness.     in greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of value added tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather.  reuter &#3;</h3>
