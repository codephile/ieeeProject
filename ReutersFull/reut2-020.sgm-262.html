	<h3>the federal reserve is expected to enter the government securities market to add reserves via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.     they expected the amount to total around 1.5 billion to two billion dlrs.     economists added that the low rate on federal funds indicates the fed is unlikely to add funds agressively through overnight system repurchases, unless it feels the need to calm volatile financial markets.     federal funds were trading at 7-1/8 pct, down from yesterday's average of 7.61 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
