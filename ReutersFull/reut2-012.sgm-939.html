	<h3>the british petroleum co plc <bp.l> said it had no plans to close its refinery in gothenburg, despite forecasts by a swedish finance ministry committee that it might be planning such a move.     the committee said the refinery's future looked bleak because the swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness was expected to worsen unless it invested, and because of the effects of a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content.     but bp said the unit, in which sweden's <ok petroleum ab> has a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically and financially up to and including the first quarter of 1987.     current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known future plans for both sweden and export markets did not cause it any serious problems, it said in a statement.     the refinery started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes.  reuter &#3;</h3>
