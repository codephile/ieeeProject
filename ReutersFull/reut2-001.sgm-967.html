	<h3>the hong kong dollar fixed rate market was shut down this afternoon after a 200 mln h.k. dlr certificate of deposit issue for the chinese state-owned bank of communications ltd hong kong branch suddenly surfaced, bankers said.     disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the road to recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in early february but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue.     brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and all major players stopped making markets in existing issues.     the fixed rate market, which consists mainly of cds tied to swaps or asset repackaging, began to fall about a month ago due to indigestion after 18 cd issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrs flooded the market in january.     bankers said the shake-up was a result of participants pushing the market up too fast in january amid intense speculation that the hong kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate against the u.s. dollar would soon be changed.     the speculation depressed local interest rates and unleashed a flood of new issues.     but the speculation faded in early february and interest rates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintaining the peg, thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed rate capital market.     by late february the market had recovered considerably but dai-ichi kangyo bank and morgan guaranty trust co of new york launched their issues and pushed the market down again. since then there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks until china development finance co (h.k.) ltd (cdfc), a unit of the bank of china, launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with quarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today.     brokers said the market was steady early this morning but began to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new issue circulated.     when the deal was launched the major players quickly suspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own issues, brokers said. "we just don't know where the market is going," said a european banker.     they said the bank of communications issue traded at a low of 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10 basis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sister banks in the bank of china group.     an official with one of the chinese banks said the deal was launched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with the market at that time.     but a european banker said pricing was not an issue in the present market conditions, "the timing was just not right."     "if banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues now, and then the market would be all right," another dealer said.     "but there is no reason to be overly pessimistic," he said. "the effect of this issue on the market should not be as bad as what happened after the dkb and morgan deals."     despite the criticism bankers said cdfc still managed to recruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the group has not yet been finalised.     "any trader should recommend his bank against joining the deal," said a dealer. "but there are other considerations such as relationship." he admitted his bank has joined as co-manager.     a banker said he saw no reason why the market makers decided to shut down if they were willing to join the new issue.     "perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a chinese entity has taken the sole lead position for a chinese issue," he said.     previously chinese entities have always acted as co-lead managers, whether for chinese or foreign issues.  reuter &#3;</h3>
