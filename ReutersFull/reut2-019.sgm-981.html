	<h3>pakistan announced a new tea import policy, saying 70 pct of imports will in future be made through the state trading corporation of pakistan (tcp).    commerce minister mahbubul haq said in a television broadcast that no more than one-third of the remaining 30 pct allocated to the private sector would be permitted to come from any one country.    the new policy was announced some three months after the government suspended import licences and ordered an inquiry into tea purchase policy.    traders said the move was designed to put pressure on kenya, which provided some 48 pct of pakistan's 75-80 mln kilo annual tea imports, to buy pakistani manufactured goods in exchange.     liptons and brooke bond, two units of britain's unilever plc, control 95 pct of pakistan's hard-pack tea market, traders said.    haq, who is also planning minister, was outlining a new three-year trade policy from the start of financial 1987/88 on july 1.  reuter &#3;</h3>
