	<h3>the paris club of creditor nations agreed to a major rescheduling of uganda's and mozambique's government-to-government debts, the club said in a statement.     at meetings here this week, both countries were accorded terms that were more generous than usually granted by the club. uganda was given 15 years to repay its debts with a six-year grace period while mozambique was accorded an exceptionally long 20-year period, with 10 years' grace.     the club said it approved of both countries' economic and financial programs and would therefore make a contribution to improve their external payments prospects.     it said both countries faced heavy debt service obligations and low per capita income, adding the solution of the countries' debt problems would take a number of years.     the statement also said mozambique's limited debt service capacity made borrowing from the international monetary fund in the upper credit tranches "inappropriate."     no details were available from the countries' embassies nor from the club on the amounts involved, but last week the ugandan finance minister chrispus kiyonga said he was hoping for a rescheduling of 120 mln dlrs. uganda's total foreign debt is estimated at some 1.5 billion dlrs.     a french finance ministry statement issued the same time as the paris club statement, said france had formally agreed with gabon to reschedule bilateral unpaid debt amounting to about 440 mln francs.     the bilateral agreement, covering payments due to have been made by may 31 this year, follows the paris club's january decision to grant gabon an extended repayment period for its government-to-government debt.     the ministry said french aid to gabon in 1987, within the framework of the country's economic recovery program, amounts to about 1.67 billion francs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
