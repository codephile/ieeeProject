	<h3>canadian foreign secretary joe clark, winding up a two-day visit to washington, said he expected the reagan administration to take some action on reducing acid rain.     "my impression is there will be some movement by the united states administration on acid rain (but) how much movement i can't judge or predict," he told reporters.     the meetings with american officials are part of a routine u.s.-canada consultation but are also expected to lay the groundwork for a summit in ottawa next month between president reagan and prime minister brian mulroney.     clark today held discussions with treasury secretary james baker and democratic sens. patrick moynihan of new york, christopher dodd of connecticut, lloyd bentsen of texas and george mitchell of maine.     yesterday, he held talks with vice president george bush, secretary of state george shultz and commerce secretary malcolm baldrige.     among its priorities, canada is seeking evidence that reagan is prepared to live up to a commitment made last year to implement in the united states a five-year 5 billion u.s. dlr program to test cleaner ways of burning coal.     this issue was discussed at length with baker and several of the senators, including mitchell who urged canada to "keep the heat on" the reagan administration to force action, canadian officials said.     also taken up with most of the senators and baker were trade issues, including the need for the united states and canada to establish a better mechanism for settling trade disputes between the two countries, who are each other's major trading partner, canadian officials said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
