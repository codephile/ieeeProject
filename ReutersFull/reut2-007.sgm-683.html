	<h3>gulf canada corp said a discharge of material at its amauligak drilling site in the beaufort sea caused no danger to the environment.     yesterday, the federal department of energy charged gulf canada with eight counts of illegal dumping for discharging powdered cement and drilling mud between september 23 and 30 last year.     the charges carry a maximum 50,000 dlr fine on each count.     gulf said the government's charges relate to discharging materials without a permit, not to environmental damage resulting from the action.     gulf said it voluntarily informed appropriate government officials when the material was discharged.     the company also said none of the material was discharged within 12 miles of the closest shoreline. it added that one of the materials cited, barite, is a naturally occurring mineral routinely discharged into the sea during drilling operations.  reuter &#3;</h3>
