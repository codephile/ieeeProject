	<h3>commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized countries (nics) to revalue currencies that are tied to the dollar in order to help the united states cut its massive trade deficit.     "we do need to do something with those currencies or we will be substituting japanese products for taiwanese products," or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar, baldrige told a house banking subcommittee.     the u.s. dollar has declined in value against the yen and european currencies, but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as south korea and taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.     as a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries.     baldrige told a house banking subcommittee that the treasury department was attempting to persuade those countries to reach agreement with the united states on exchange rates.   reuter &#3;</h3>
