	<h3>taiwan's balance of payments surplus widened to a record 16.62 billion u.s. dlrs in calendar 1986 from 9.35 billion in 1985, the central bank said.     a bank official attributed the increase mainly to taiwan's growing trade surplus, which increased to a record 16.8 billion u.s. dlrs in 1986 from 11.2 billion in 1985.     he said the deficit on invisible trade narrowed to 740 mln u.s. dlrs from 1.97 billion.     invisible earnings rose to 6.77 billion from 5.09 billion while invisible spending climbed to 7.51 billion from 7.06 billion, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
