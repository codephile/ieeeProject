	<h3>conditions on the floating rate note market appeared to be returning gradually to normal today with prices static to a little better generally, dealers said.     the market was showing limited signs of recovery from the collapse in trading last night and the calmer tone was reinforced this morning as the first significant retail orders for some time emerged, one senior frn trader noted.     in fixed rate bonds, the tone was likewise quietly firmer with euroyen and eurosterling maintaining their recent bullish trend and activity in dollar straight and ecu-denominated bonds also picking up slowly.     although a handful of frn market makers were expected to remain on the sidelines for the time being, dealers noted a tangible return of retail interest from the far east, lured back by extremely attractive yields and bargain prices.     "we are seeing from singapore, and from japan clients keen to use up their quotas for purchase of particular instruments before the end of the fiscal year," the senior trader added.     any investors not buying to their full limit would run the risk of having that limit reduced next year, he explained.     however, he pointed out that mainly sovereign paper was in demand with u.s. bank sector paper largely ignored.     prices of reasonable quality floaters had firmed by an average of 10 basis points in early trading but frn dealers cautioned that the mood was still nervous.     "if prices rise by too much too quickly, everyone is more than well-aware of the danger the selling could set in again," commented another frn market source at a large japanese house.     the other sector commanding market attention today was eurosterling, which soared in line with u.k. government bonds.     both markets were pushed higher by an ebullient pound and renewed buying by u.k. institutions following chancellor of the exchequer's nigel lawson's well-received budget yesterday.     "this was definitely a budget for lower sterling interest rates," said a sterling analyst at a u.k. merchant bank.     "it has been exceptionally well-received by the city, looks good to foreign investors and we are sure to see a rush to tap the eurosterling markets now," he added.     news that next year's public sector borrowing requirement will be held at 4.0 billion stg from an earlier projected 7.0 billion was influential for fixed rate stg investment markets. the government's reduced need to tap the gilt-edged markets will create a perennial shortage of stock, maintaining upward pressure on prices, a sterling bond dealer commented.     this could further boost demand for eurosterling bonds, as long as yield margins remain attractive in relation to gilts -- often the case with newer, if not with more seasoned issues.     bullish predictions on the u.k.'s general economic health were also expected to boost foreign interest in eurosterling.     market sources said attention would now switch to monitoring the fortunes of the ruling conservative party in opinion polls ahead of a widely-anticipated general election.     although several new sterling deals are expected, in early trading the only sterling denominated one to emerge was a 30 mln convertible deal for british land co plc.     other new deals this morning reflected the recent primary market trend with little activity in dollar-denominated issues although the currency sectors were busy.     hot on the heels of yesterday's two canadian dollar issues was a 75 mln dlr six-year bond for chrysler credit canada, guaranteed by chrysler finance paying 9-1/4 pct and priced at 101-1/2 pct.     a 15 billion euroyen issue was launched for associates corp of north america paying five pct at 102-3/8 pct due 1992. a similar euroyen offering was reported to be in the market for a scandinavian borrower. details were not immediately available.  reuter &#3;</h3>
