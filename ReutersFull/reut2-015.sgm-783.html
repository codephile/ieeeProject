	<h3>mars stores inc said sales for the five weeks ended april 4 were off 22.3 pct to 8,242,525 dlrs from 10.6 mln dlrs a year earlier.     the company said sales for the first nine weeks of its fiscal year were off 14.5 pct to 14.1 mln dlrs from 16.5 mln dlrs a year before.     results exclude the discontiued big value outlet division, it said, and are not directly comparable because easter fell in march last year and will fall late in april this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
