	<h3>house banking committee chairman fernand st germain, d-r.i., called for caution in giving savings associations forbearance in paying their debts as part of a bill providing three billion dlrs in new capital for the federal savings and loan insurance corp.     "we cannot let forbearance stretch to protect the mismanaged or terminal cases that would serve to further drain the fslic fund," st germain said at the start of a hearing on fslic legislation. "forbearance must be designed to help the well managed institution temporarily on hard times. it must not be forgiveness for the speculators, the high flyers and the fast buck artists."     the use of forbearance for well-managed institutions was endorsed at the hearing by texas savings and loan commissioner l.l. bowman, the federal home loan bank of dallas and the texas savings and loan league.  reuter &#3;</h3>
