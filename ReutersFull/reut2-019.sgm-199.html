	<h3>dutch public authorities are on course to meet the 1987 public sector deficit target of 7.9 pct of net national income (nni) despite excess spending by the central government, according to a leaked official report.     the so-called spring report, giving latest revenue and expenditure figures and to be discussed by the dutch cabinet today, was leaked in advance to the dutch press. the dutch finance ministry declined to comment on the press reports.     newspapers quoted the report, drafted by finance minister onno ruding, as saying unexpected rises in revenue would compensate for excess spending of 3.1 billion guilders.     ruding, putting this year's public sector borrowing requirement 0.1 percentage point below last september's target at 7.8 pct, criticised the excess spending but will not seek additional spending cuts for 1987 because of the surprise boost in revenue, the report was quoted as saying.     excess spending by the central government was put at 2.8 billion guilders, while market factors accounted for another 300 mln in unbudgetted expenditure.     but 1987 revenue was boosted by an unexpected 3.55 billion, including 1.9 billion in tax revenue and 500 mln guilders in income from natural gas sales.     ruding has said the 1987 excess spending will burden the 1988 budget with an additional 1.9 billion and the cabinet has already pledged 1.2 billion in cuts to narrow the gap.     the cabinet is to discuss in coming months what further austerity measures will be needed next year to keep the government on target for its 1990 aim of a public sector borrowing requirement of no more than 5.25 pct of nni.     ruding has already met opposition from the liberal and christian-democrat factions carrying the government majority in parliament to his calls for more spending cuts in the 1988 budget to counter a slow-down in economic growth.  reuter &#3;</h3>
