	<h3>a senior world bank official said the lending agency planned to authorise almost 70 mln dlrs in new credits to bolster the productive structure of bolivia's state oil company ypfb this year.      david knox, world bank vice-president for latin america, said bolivia should invest in projects which would spur growth following six consecutive years of economic contraction.      knox said the world bank supported the economic stabilisation programme adopted by president victor paz estenssoro.      knox said he had suggested to bolivian authorities that they invest as much of their disposable resources as possible in works "of rapid reaction, and which support the decision to make the bolivian economy grow."      knox is to hold talks with paz estenssoro, as well as private businessmen and other government ministers during his visit.  reuter &#3;</h3>
