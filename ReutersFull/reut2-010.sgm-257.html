	<h3>northwest aluminum co said it will open a second pot line in mid-may, bringing the smelter here to 80 pct of its production capacity.     northwest aluminum president brett wilcox, who leased the 30-year-old smelter from martin marietta corp., said production would increase from around 45 tons a year at present to just over 70 tons.     martin marietta closed and mothballed the smelter in 1984. northwest aluminum reopened it last december.     wilcox said a good aluminum market and several months of successful operation led to the decision to expand production.   reuter &#3;</h3>
