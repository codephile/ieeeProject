	<h3>steel stocks, which have had a healthy runup recently, still present some short term investment opportunities, according to some steel analysts.     but others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end soon. they recommend taking profits.     "it's that time of year. this is strictly seasonal," said charles bradford of merrill lynch and co. "orders will be strong for about two months, and there are signs that some (order rates) are starting to dive already."     but dean witter reynolds inc analyst clarence morrison sees some short-term potential in the group, which includes usx corp <x>, bethlehem steel corp <bs>, armco inc <as> and inland steel industries inc <iad>.     "there is still some attractiveness to steels over the short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and rising prices," morrison said. he only recommends one stock, however, inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to make them more efficient.     despite his bearishness, merrill's bradford continues to recommend armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.     armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with usx, bradford noted. "it's not a high-quality investment situation yet but they've come a long way," he said.     "we think the stock will do moderately better than the market," he said. armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today, could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.     bradford sees armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987, before special gains from recouped investment tax credits, against losses last year.     armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he said.     bradford is recommending sale of usx shares. "we had a buy on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have it," he said.     the steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, bradford said. "but a lot depends on oil prices," he added. about 60 pct of usx's sales come from oil and natural gas.     other analysts, including michelle galanter applebaum of salomon brothers inc, recommend usx. "the company's done a lot (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit for," she said.     she sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. usx was trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. she predicts usx will earn 18 cts a share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in 1986.     applebaum, who is also positive on armco and inland, has been recommending the stocks since last november.     peter marcus of painewebber inc is neutral on the group although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the third quarter.     but he sees potential trouble beyond then. "i think (steel) prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer," he said.     applebaum of salomon brothers also sees some seasonal dropoff later in the year. "but there are more positives than negatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
