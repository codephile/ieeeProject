	<h3>international coffee organization (ico) exporters will modify their new proposal on quota resumption before presenting it to importers tomorrow, ico delegates said.     the change, which will be discussed tonight informally among producers, follows talks after the formal producer session with the eight-member producer splinter group and will affect the proposed quota distribution for 12 months from april one, they said.     the proposed share-out would still include shortfall declarations, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
