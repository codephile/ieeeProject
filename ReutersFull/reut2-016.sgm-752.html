	<h3>china will be short of sorghum in 1987 for the sixth successive year because high production costs and low profits discourage farmers from growing it, the china daily business weekly said.     it said sorghum output in calendar 1986 was 5.34 mln tonnes, down five pct from the 1985 level, and prices on the free market rose in january to 0.42 yuan per kg, up 14 pct on january 1986.     it said sorghum acreage in 1987 is six pct lower than in 1986. sorghum accounts for 40 pct of the raw materials needed by china's breweries, it added but gave no more details.  reuter &#3;</h3>
