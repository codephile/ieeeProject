	<h3>there was no evidence of winterkill in yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from belgrade to near maribor, the u.s. agriculture department's counselor in belgrade said in a field report.     the report, dated february 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions.     however warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding, it said.     some yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said.     cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said.     the report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter.  reuter &#3;</h3>
