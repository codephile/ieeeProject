	<h3>the bank of japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters.     he said the pledge by major industrial nations in paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar rise.     unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said.     the bank of japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific.     finance minister kiichi miyazawa told parliament on friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the japanese economy.     asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of japan, the u.s. or west germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.     the senior bank official said he expects japan's gross national product (gnp) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in april. that would be little changed from the performance expected this year.     domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on gnp of nearly one percentage point, he said.     he said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. the economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.     the central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. the bank of japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half.     although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. "we are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet," he added.     liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.     the liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices, the bank official said. this inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
