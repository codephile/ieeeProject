	<h3><royal trustco ltd> said it does not plan to enter the brokerage business when ownership of ontario investment dealers is opened to other financial institutions on june 30.     "the short answer is no, we do not intend to get directly into the brokerage business, but we will compete with it," chief executive michael cornelissen told the annual meeting in reply to a shareholder's inquiry.     cornelissen said royal trust, canada's second biggest trust company, was concerned about a possible conflict of interest between its current asset management functions and brokerage and stock promotion activities.     cornelissen also cited the heavy competition in the canadian securities industry as a factor in royal trust's decision to avoid direct involvement in a brokerage firm.     he told shareholders, however, that royal trust would continue to compete with investment dealers through its asset management programs and discount processing of retail stock trades.     royal trust also plans to take further advantage of networking possibilities offered by its involvement in financial conglomerate <trilon financial corp>, 50 pct-owner of royal trust, cornelissen said.     afterward, cornelissen told reporters that royal trust's dow financial services corp unit planned no more divestitures after its previously reported agreement yesterday to restructure its financial operations in asia with joint owner <mbf holdings ltd>.     cornelissen also told reporters the company was confident of achieving its targeted 15 pct growth in earnings per share this year. royal trust's basic per share earnings rose 16 pct in 1986 to 2.20 dlrs.     "with two months of the year gone, we are ahead of it (the 15 pct growth target)," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
