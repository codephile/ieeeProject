	<h3>an international sugar organization (iso) committee discussed the terms of a new administrative international sugar agreement but did not debate the most controversial area of budget contributions, delegates said.     progress was made in a number of technical areas, but with one of the main importers, the soviet union, unable to attend because of prior commitments, the distribution of votes and contributions was not raised, an iso spokesman said.     delegates said private meetings are also taking place between the main participants to discuss the details of the new agreement. the committee is due to meet again tomorrow.  reuter &#3;</h3>
