	<h3>dutch parliamentary parties have re-affirmed their support for the government's opposition to the proposed european community tax on oils and fats, parliamentarians said.     a broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the u.s. and on the potentially damaging effect on third world countries.     state secretary for foreign affairs rene van der linden said the government was against the tax although it noted deepening ec financial difficulties.     "it is difficult to be against the tax and against extra finance. the ec members have to make a choice," van der linden said.     however, he denied the government had dropped its opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position.  reuter &#3;</h3>
