	<h3>the port of philadelphia was closed when a cypriot oil tanker, seapride ii, ran aground after hitting a 200-foot tower supporting power lines across the river, a coast guard spokesman said.     he said there was no oil spill but the ship is lodged on rocks opposite the hope creek nuclear power plant in new jersey.     he said the port would be closed until today when they hoped to refloat the ship on the high tide.     after delivering oil to a refinery in paulsboro, new jersey, the ship apparently lost its steering and hit the power transmission line carrying power from the nuclear plant to the state of delaware.  reuter &#3;</h3>
