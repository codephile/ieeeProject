	<h3>u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng warned the european community yesterday it will face serious retaliation if it enacts a new tax on products such as u.s. soybean oil.     speaking at a news conference before a scheduled speech, lyng said he did not think the tax, which is still in the discussion stage, would be approved.     he said the u.s. would take serious retaliatory action because if implemented, the tax would have a considerable impact on u.s. farmers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
