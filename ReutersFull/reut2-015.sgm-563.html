	<h3>french government ministers will meet next tuesday to discuss measures to cover the state social security fund's deficit before the summer, prime minister jacques chirac's social affairs adviser, marie-helene berard, said.     employment ministry officials say the fund, in surplus until 1985, faces a 24 billion franc deficit by the end of this year, largely because of rising unemployment. budget minister alain juppe said the fund needed more resources and a management overhaul. the government was not in favour of introducing an additional tax to fund the deficit as did the  previous socialist administration between 1982 and 1985, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
