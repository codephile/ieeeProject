	<h3>the united states said it was doing what it could to ease tension in the aegean as greek and turkish warships headed for a possible clash over oil drilling rights on the sea's continental shelf.     state department spokesman charles redman told reporters, "we have urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid any actions which might exacerbate the situation."     "in the light of the most recent developments, we are consulting with the parties and with other interested allies on means to reduce tensions," he added.     redman declined to elaborate on what washington was doing, but he said an emergency meeting of nato ambassadors in brussels on the subject was only one path it was pursuing.     he also refused to say which side was to blame for the renewed confrontation, saying washington was still trying to ascertain all the facts, as prime minister andreas papanderou said greece was prepared to tackle any aggressor.     "the crucial point here is that these are two friends and allies. we don't want to see tension rise and we are doing what we can to see if we can help here," redman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
