	<h3>the senate budget committee, at its first budget drafting meeting of the year, discarded president reagan's economic assumptions upon which he claims his budget would show a 108 billion dlr deficit.     in its place, the committee agreed to accept the non partisan congressional budget office (cbo) economic assumptions in its deliberations for drafting a 1988 budget.     the cbo says reagan's budget--even if it were adopted without change --would show a 134.4 billion dlr deficit in fiscal 1988 and thereby miss the gramm-rudman budget law target of 108 billion dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
