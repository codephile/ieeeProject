	<h3>(john labatt ltd)'s labatt breweries ltd unit has the right to stage this year's formula one grand prix race in montreal, quebec's superior court ruled.     the court ruled that labatt's contract with the city of montreal granting it control over the race track is binding and granted the company an injunction preventing the city from finding another sponser.     the city has been negotiating with an american promoter backed by (molson companies ltd), which wants to stage the race.     labatt has been losing money on the race on the race since it started sponsering the event eight years ago.               reuter &#3;</h3>
