	<h3>a huge five billion dlr credit facility being syndicated for two subsidiaries of british petroleum co plc <bp.l> should be well received in the market, given the relatively generous terms it carries, banking sources said.     the sources said they believe the committed four year revolving credit - the largest of its kind in the euromarkets - carries a facility fee of 1/8 pct and that drawings will be at 1/8 pct over the london interbank offered rate (libor).     morgan guaranty trust co of new york, which is arranging the financing in conjunction with its london operation, was not available to commment on the terms.     bp announced it was arranging the financing earlier today as part of its planned tender offer for the 45 pct of standard oil co that it does not own already.     in addition to the revolving credit, bp also is arranging a u.s. commercial paper program for an as yet undetermined amount, which will be supported by the revolver.     bankers noted that the terms on the new facility compare extremely favourably to those on other short-term facilities for which pricing has turned extremely fine due to competition for the mandates. it also contrasts with the 1/16 pct fee bp paid on a recent 1.5 billion dlr refinancing of some existing debt.     earlier today a morgan guaranty official, while declining to reveal the pricing on the facility said that banks would be "compensated fairly" since this is a special purpose facility which must be completed quickly, with the signing expected in about 10 days.     the facility is only being syndicated among bp's relationship banks and therefore has large individual commitments from the banks. lead managers are being recruited at the 200 mln dlr level, co-lead managers at 125 mln and managers at 75 mln.     however, bankers said that despite the size it is likely the financing will get done quickly since banks will want to be seen as supporting the relationship.     the financing is being arranged in the name of bp international and bp north america.  reuter &#3;</h3>
