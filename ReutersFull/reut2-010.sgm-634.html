	<h3>a chinese leader said the country's foreign debt was rising but the level was not dangerous and china valued its good credit rating in the world.     vice-premier tian jiyun told a news conference for foreign journalists the debt, including foreign investment, was 20.6 billion dlrs at end-1986, of which 7.6 billion were in long-term, low-interest loans.     "considering the national economic strength of china and the scale of its imports and exports, this level of foreign debt can be sustained by china now and has not developed to a dangerous point," he said.     finance minister wang bingqian said in the budget speech on thursday that foreign borrowings in 1987 would be almost double the 1986 level and nearly six times the 1985 amount.     under chairman mao tse-tung's rule from 1949-1976, china borrowed very little abroad, insisting that nearly all development be financed from the country's own resources.     tian took the opposite view. "it is not enough for us to rely totally on our own funds and capital (to achieve its modernisation). we have to have the courageous spirit to borrow a certain amount of foreign loans," he said.     he said china must not borrow too much and no more than it can repay. "china has good credit in terms of foreign borrowing and we value this good credit," he said.     vice premier yao yilin, a former commerce minister, told the same news conference some people said china's foreign debt was already too much and others said china could increase the amount.     "they proceed from their own perspectives to make such remarks. we must always be clear-headed when we analyse the situation," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
