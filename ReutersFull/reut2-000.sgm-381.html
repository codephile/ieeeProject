	<h3>the u.s. asset-backed debt securities market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.     "it is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed deals of the year were done by commercial banks," said anthony dub, who heads first boston corp's asset-backed group.     bankamerica corp's <bac> bank of america unit last week issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card receivables via sole manager first boston. dub said the offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.     the bank of america offering followed a january 16 issue of 200 mln dlrs of similar debt by republicbank corp's <rpt> republicbank delaware unit. goldman, sachs and co ran the books on that deal, with first boston acting as co-manager.     however, dub said the bank of america securities were more closely related to the so-called "cars deals" that raced to market last year than were the republicbank securities.     "the republicbank issue was secured by credit card receivables. in contrast, the bank of america deal was the first public offering of credit card receivables because we used a grantor trust vehicle," he said.     in a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest in the trust, analysts explained.     the bank of america certificates were issued by california credit card trust a, which the bank established for that single purpose, investment bankers pointed out.     the debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in 1992. first boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over comparable treasury securities. non-callable for life, the deal was rated aaa by both moody's and standard and poor's.     underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the bank of america deal was priced too aggressively. "aaa-rated auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over treasuries when first boston priced the deal," one said.     however, dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.     the first boston executive attributed this to the deal's top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's cars deals, which were rated by s and p alone.     "investors receive interest only payments for the first 18 months and then interest and principal payments for the remaining five to seven months," dub detailed.     investment bankers pointed out that because the bank of america deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals that were brought to market late last year.     the collateral for the trust includes a pool of visa credit card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. bank of america has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making it one of the biggest in the u.s., analysts said.     last week's deal was bank of america's second foray into the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.     in mid-december 1986 bank of america sold, via california cars grantor trust 1986-a, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed by automobile receivables through salomon brothers inc.     upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes backed by the car leases of volvo 1986 lease finance corp, a unit of volvo finance north america inc, via first boston, and 450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of mack trucks receivables corp, a unit of mack trucks inc <mack>, via shearson lehmand brothers inc.     the asset backed market, which began in march 1985, totals an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
