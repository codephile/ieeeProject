	<h3>an international protocol to severely limit the use of industrial chemicals which are believed to damage the earth's protective ozone layer could be signed this year, officials and scientists here said.     "by the end of this year, we should have an international protocol in place we can all be proud of," u.s. environmental protection agency officer bill long told reporters.     the chemicals are chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs) which are used in refrigeration and making foam plastics, solvents and aerosols. the earth's upper ozone layer absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.     the officials and scientists were meeting in tokyo, ahead of an international conference on the problem later this month in either vienna, or geneva, long said.     robert watson, a program manager for atmospheric problems at the u.s. national aeronautics and space administration said a protocol should demand an initial freeze on the use of cfcs by industry. this should be followed by a gradual reduction in cfc volume until no cfc gases are released into the air, he said. the u.s. has already banned use of use cfcs in aerosols and japan has asked for voluntary restraint, but both still use cfcs in industrial processes.  reuter &#3;</h3>
