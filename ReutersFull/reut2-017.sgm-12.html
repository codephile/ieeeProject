	<h3>the new york times co said that if prevailing business conditions continue, the company sees "another outstanding year, although the remaining quarters of 1987 will probably not show uniform gains."     the company's first quarter earnings rose 21 pct to 41.1 mln dlrs or 50 cts a share compared to 33.9 mln dlrs or 42 cts a share in the year-ago quarter restated for a two-for-one stock split.         the company also said its newspaper division, which includes the new york times and 32 regional newspapers, had a first quarter operating profit of 69.8 mln dlrs compared with 60.7 mln dlrs in the year-ago first quarter mainly due to advertising volume and rate increases.     the company's magazine division, which includes "family circle," had a first quarter profit of 9.7 mln dlrs compared to 7.4 mln dlrs in the year ago quarter.     the company's broadcasting and cable tv group reported an operating profit of 2.9 mln dlrs compared to 2.6 mln dlrs in the year-ago first quarter.  reuter &#3;</h3>
