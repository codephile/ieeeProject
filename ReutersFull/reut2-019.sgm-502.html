	<h3>lebanese bank employees went on a one-day strike to draw attention to the fate of three central bank colleagues missing, believed kidnapped, since 1985.     the strike, which shut the foreign exchange market and banks across the country, was called by the central bank employees' union and the bankers' association, which groups more than 80 lebanese banks.     the three missing christian employees are believed to have been kidnapped while crossing from christian east beirut to moslem west beirut nearly two years ago.  reuter &#3;</h3>
