	<h3>belgian total money stock rose to 1,140.4 billion francs at the end of 1986 from 1,115.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of last year and 1,055.0 billion at the end of 1985, belgian national bank figures showed.     paper money rose to 404.1 billion francs from 394.1 billion and 383.5 billion respectively, other forms of privately held money to 679.5 billion from 652.7 billion and 616.0 billion.     money held by the public authorities fell to 56.8 billion francs from 68.6 billion at the end of the previous quarter but was above the 55.5 billion at the end of 1985, the bank said.     the government does not set money supply targets, arguing they are inappropriate to a small economy with major trading and monetary links with much larger trading countries.  reuter &#3;</h3>
