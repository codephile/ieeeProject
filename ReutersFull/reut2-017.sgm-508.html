	<h3>the zambian government today announced minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the northern copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.     however, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal, were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more sweeping reductions.     observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.     residents in the copperbelt contacted by telephone said government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.     in lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.     president kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on may 1.     the revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic strategy which kaunda adopted to replace zambia's imf austerity program.     labour leaders in the copperbelt said last week gangs of unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile region to take action against shops that did not reduce their prices after today's deadline. fifteen people were killed in the copperbelt during food riots last december after the government tried to lift maize subsidies.  reuter &#3;</h3>
