	<h3>american telephone and telegraph co said the georgia public service commission (psc) approved its 4.1 mln dlr rate restructuring proposal to reduce intrastate long distance rates by about 4.4 pct.     att said it will file new prices at the psc in august to meet a sept. 1 effective date set by the commission.     the telephone company said it asked the psc on nov. 7 for permission to increase its prices for intrastate private line services, used mainly by large business customers, which att said were priced below its access costs.     "private line service has been grossly underpriced since 1984, and, therefore, it has been subsidized by all long distance users," terry hobbs, assistant vice president said.     "as a result of today's psc decision to allow our private line service prices to cover their access costs, these subsidies will end and we'll be able to reduce basic long distance rates for everyone," he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
