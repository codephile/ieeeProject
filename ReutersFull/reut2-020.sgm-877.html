	<h3>venezuela will back ecuador's bid to raise its opec quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd) because it is a justifiable demand, venezuelan energy minister arturo hernandez grisanti said on monday.     he told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an earthquake last march.     "for this five-month period, ecuador did not exercise its right to produce 221,000 bpd," he said. "we should recognize ecuador's right to increase its quota ... there is a basis of justice in that country's petition."     he added however, the quota increase should be gradual to avoid harming the market, he added.     hernandez grisanti said he understood ecuador would formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next ministerial conference of the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) opening december 9 in vienna.  reuter &#3;</h3>
