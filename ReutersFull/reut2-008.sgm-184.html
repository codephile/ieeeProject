	<h3>the business climate in west german manufacturing industry worsened slightly last month after deteriorating markedly in january, the ifo economic research institute said.     it said its february survey showed firms were also increasingly pessimistic about the outlook for the coming months, causing them to cut back production plans.     ifo blamed the worsening of the business climate and outlook largely on expectations of further declines in foreign demand.     more than a quarter of the firms polled said they thought orders in hand were insufficient.     overall, the business climate in february could be described as just short of satisfactory, ifo said.     in a breakdown of responses by industrial sector, the institute said manufacturers of basic products judged the business climate to be slightly less favourable in february than in january. for the coming months they expect export prospects to dim and production to fall, it added.     chemical firms reported a slight improvement in demand but they increasingly said orders on hand were insufficient.     the business climate in the capital goods industry was unchanged in february compared with january, but ifo said this was due entirely to positive reports from makers of commercial vehicles.     demand in the capital goods sector was generally described as weak, with the outlook in february cloudier than it had been in january, the institute said.     the business climate in the consumer durables sector remained above the industry average in february. carmakers were again positive about current business but forecast a slight worsening of business conditions in the near future.     in the consumer goods industry business conditions were described as favourable in february.     a small cutback in production meant orders on hand in this sector rose compared with january, the institute said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
