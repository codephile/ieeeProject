	<h3>the house of representatives appropriations committee yesterday approved 300 mln dlrs in economic aid for four central american states, 50 mln dlrs to black-led states neighbouring south africa and 50 mln dlrs in military assistance for the philippines.     the programmes, part of 1.3 billion dlr supplemental budget request by the reagan administration to restore funds cut earlier by congress, must be approved by congress.     the committee rejected the administration's request for 21.6 mln dlrs as the u.s. contribution to u.n. peace-keeping troops in lebanon.     the 300 mln dlrs will go to el salvador, honduras, guatemala and costa rica while another 12 mln dlrs was allocated to replace the earthquake-damaged u.s. embassy in san salvador.     the 50 mln dlrs approved for a "southern africa" initiative is part of a larger programme promised by the reagan administration last year when it tried unsuccessfully to block sanctions approved by congress against south africa's white-minority government.  reuter &#3;</h3>
