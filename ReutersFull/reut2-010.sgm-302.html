	<h3>fisons plc <fisn.l> said it planned to raise about 110 mln stg through an international placing of up to 18 mln new shares, mainly in europe and the far east.     the operation would be conducted by a syndicate of international banks led by <county securities ltd>.     the issue would not be underwritten and shares would only be allocated to syndicate banks to meet true demand from end-investors. the share price would be determined according to market conditions, but its expected that it would be at the middle market price.     a fisons statement said that although the pharmaceutical group achieved more than 80 pct of its sales outside the u.k., with rapidly increasing interest from international investors, less than two pct of its shares were held overseas.     the issue would help meet this interest, enhance the group's standing in the capital markets and increase demand for its shares. the issue would also be a cost effective way of raising new equity, it said.     the new funds would be used for the developing of existing operations and also for acquisitions if suitable opportunities arose.     the issue, which represents 5.5 pct of the company's authorised capital, requires shareholder approval. a meeting has been arranged for april 21.     fisons shares eased one penny on the announcement by 0830 gmt to 657p.  reuter &#3;</h3>
