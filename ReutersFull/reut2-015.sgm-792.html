	<h3>belgium's current account surplus, measured on a cash basis, widened sharply to 134.9 billion francs last year from 17.5 billion in 1985, the finance ministry said.     the increase was due almost entirely to a sharp rise in the goods trade surplus to 126.1 billion francs from 20.4 billion.     the services trade surpluses increased to 52.4 billion francs from 38.9 billion while the deficit on transfers rose slightly to 43.6 billion from 41.8 billion.     private sector capital operations showed a steeply higher deficit of 160.7 billion francs after 56.9 billion in 1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
