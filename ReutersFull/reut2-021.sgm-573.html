	<h3>the japan/india-pakistan-gulf/japan shipping conference said it would cut the extra risk insurance surcharges on shipments to iranian and iraqi ports to a minimum three pct from 4.5 pct on october 25.     it said surcharges on shipments of all break-bulk cargoes to non-iraqi arab ports would be reduced to 3.0 pct from 4.5.     a conference spokesman declined to say why the move was taken at a time of heightened tension in the gulf.  reuter &#3;</h3>
