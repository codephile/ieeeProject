	<h3>american telephone and telegraph co does not plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts a share on its common stock, said james e. olson, chairman.     "it has been the intent to set the dividend at a level so that it could be sustained through the ups and downs of the business cycle," olson told a meeting of securities analysts.     "we see no reason to change that policy," he said.     although att will maintain its current dividend, olson said the company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paid in dividends by increasing earnings.     industry analysts had speculated that att might cut its common dividend, especially after the company posted a fourth quarter net loss of 1.17 billion dlrs and earned only five cts a share for the full year.     the loss included a one-time restructuring charge of 1.7 billion dlrs.     olson said he expects att's cash flow to remain strong despite the poor earnings.  reuter &#3;</h3>
