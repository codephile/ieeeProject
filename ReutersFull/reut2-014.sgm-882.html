	<h3>the ministries of finance and justice said they have presented parliament with a new law to make insider trading in shares a criminal offence.     a year ago, the amsterdam bourse announced its own rules, effective from january 1, 1987, aimed at preventing unfair use of inside information in the trading shares listed on the exchange, but said back-up legislation was essential.     the proposed law calls for up to two years imprisonment, fines of up to 100,000 guilders for an individual and one million guilders for a company, and repayment to the state of profits made from insider dealing.     the proposed fines are higher than any currently in force in dutch law, a joint statement from the two ministries said.     the draft law sets no limit to the illegal profits to be repaid. the amount would be determined by a court.     a finance ministry spokesman said the time-frame for the introduction of the new legislation depended entirely on its reception in parliament.     in the meantime the bourse's share trading association monitors business closely, frequently suspending or even rescinding dealings in a stock when price movements suggest that foreknowledge of a pending announcement is being exploited.  reuter &#3;</h3>
