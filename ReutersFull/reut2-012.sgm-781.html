	<h3>keppel corp ltd <kplm.si> said it has decided to increase its convertible bond issue to 75 mln u.s. dlrs from 60 mln following overwhelming response since its launch on march 24.     "this clearly reflects the confidence investors have in the keppel group. the bond will improve the group's debt structure significantly," keppel chairman sim kee boon said.     when the bonds are converted, keppel's debt and interest expense will be further reduced and place the group in a much better financial position to expand and diversify its activities, sim said.     the 10-year bonds, issued at par, will carry a four pct annual interest and will be convertible at 3.12 singapore dlrs per one-dlr share in keppel.     the issue is lead-managed by <morgan grenfell and co ltd> with <daiwa singapore co ltd> and <morgan grenfell (asia) ltd>, and is syndicated among leading domestic and international banks and securities houses.     last month, keppel reported a group net profit of 5.1 mln singapore dlrs for the year ended december 31, 1986 against a loss of 129.6 mln dlrs in 1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
