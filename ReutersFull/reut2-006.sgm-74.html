	<h3>societe generale de belgique <belb.br> said the near doubling of net profits in 1986 was due in large part to the sale of shares in genstar corp.     the company, which announced a net non-consolidated profit of 5.31 billion francs compared with 2.82 billion in 1985, said its current profits rose by 19 pct last year, without giving further figures.     however, it added in a statement that the company made major capital gains on sales during the year, in particular from the sale of genstar shares.     societe generale governor rene lamy told last november's annual meeting that 1986 asset disposals would total around 4.5 billion francs, including the sale of genstar shares to imasco limited <ims.to>.     he predicted a profit on extraordinary items of two billion francs after a rough balance in 1985.     in today's statement, societe generale gave no figures for extraordinary gains.  reuter &#3;</h3>
