	<h3>belgian banks will need greater flexibility to choose their sphere of operations by 1992, when the european community is due to introduce free competition in banking throughout the bloc, generale de banque sa <genb.br> president eric de villegas de clercamp told a news conference.     he said at present belgian and italian banks were the most restricted in the ec.     while german banks were free to hold stakes in commercial companies in which they invested capital, belgian banks could do so only in severely limited circumstances for short periods.     "the authorities concerned should introduce within a reasonable period major modifications toward greater freedom and flexibility if we want to retain competitiveness with the neighbouring countries," de villegas said.     he said the ec authorities envisaged that after 1992 financial institutions would be able to start operations throughout the ec.     since the control of each institution would remain in the hands of the authorities in its country of origin, rules applied in member states could distort competition unless they were harmonised.  reuter &#3;</h3>
