	<h3>south africa's electricity supply commission (escom), which last year launched a massive restructuring programme after the ending of foreign loans to the country in 1985, said it met its budget targets in 1986 without foreign finance.     the electricity company, which supplies about 90 pct of south africa's power, said in its annual report that it failed to attract any foreign loans in 1986, but it was confident of meeting its funding requirements this year, despite available finance from abroad remaining restricted.     the utility, which once was south africa's largest borrower of foreign funds, said prearranged import financing facilities are expected to provide foreign funds of only about 300 mln rand this year. a further 550 mln rand will be borrowed from a blocked account administered by the south african government for the eventual repayment of about 13 billion rand in short-term loans.     these are currently frozen by an effective moratorium on repayments. the blocked account is part of a debt accord recently reached with south africa's foreign creditor banks.     south africa declared a moratorium on repayments of about 14 billion dlrs of its original 24 billion dlr total foreign debt in september 1985 after foreign bankers abruptly cut off credit lines to the country because of concern over its deteriorating political and economic climate.     pretoria last week announced that it had reached a three-year rescheduling agreement with the major international creditors that will effectively extend a moratorium on most repayments of the short-term portion of the debt until mid-1990.     escom said it plans to meet the bulk of its funding requirements this year by raising 2.2 billion rand in the south african financial markets against a total of 1.75 billion rand raised last year.     "the borrowing programme for 1987 is well within the capacity of the (domestic) financial markets, without pressure being placed on interest rates," the corporation said.     "last year we embarked on the most dramatic restructuring programme ever attempted by a major south african business, and we have largely achieved what we set out to do," escom chairman, john maree, told a news conference.  more &#3;</h3>
