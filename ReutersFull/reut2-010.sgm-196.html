	<h3>burr-brown corp said its first quarter 1987 results will show profits significantly below the 1,058,000 dlrs, or 11 cts per share, earned in the first quarter last year.     the company said the profit decline will be the result of an increase in reserves for inventory valuation. the increase will be to cover potential write-downs of certain inventories or products used in compact-disc stereo systems.     burr-brown said the possible write-down is being precipitated by a shift in market demand toward higher performance products.  reuter &#3;</h3>
