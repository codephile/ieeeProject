	<h3>texaco inc said that it had no comment in response to a statement by pennzoil co <pzl> chairman j. hugh liedtke that any settlement with texaco must be above the two billion dlrs range.     "we have no commment at this time. we have said in the past that we were willing to discuss a reasonable and economic settlement but have no comment now," a texaco spokeswoman said in response to a reuter inquiry.     liedtke told a group of security analysts in new york, "if anyone thinks this (litigation) could be setled in the two billion dlrs range, they're not being realistic."     liedtke also told analysts pennzoil would consider any reasonable settlement in its ongoing 11.0-billion-dlr suit with texaco.     neither pennzoil nor texaco has said that any talks were presently underway to resolve the dispute that arose when pennzoil charged texaco had improperly wrested control of getty corp from pennzoil.  reuter &#3;</h3>
