	<h3>frank b. hall and co, an insurance and brokerage firm, said it has joined with <risk science international> to offer banks a new service that assesses their environmental risk level.     hall said that under recently enacted legislation banks and other financial institutions can be held liable for environmental risks in projects that they finance.     therefore, hall said, rsi will evaluate a property, assign it an environmental risk level and advise the bank about its options to reduce environmental risks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
