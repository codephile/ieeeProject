	<h3>south africa will repay 13 pct of its frozen 13 billion dollar debt to foreign creditors over the next three years under an agreement reached today in london, finance minister barend du plessis said.     he said south africa already had repaid five pct of the debt under the standstill agreement expiring on june 30, 1987.     "these arrangements confirm south africa's continued willingness to maintain good relations with its foreign creditors and to meet its foreign commitments in a orderly way," du plessis told a news conference.     du plessis said the new interim debt agreement was "substantially a continuation" of the arrangement ending in june and calls for south africa to continue paying all interest on its total foreign debt of over 23 billion dlrs.     du plessis said 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with south african negotiators in london. about 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approve the agreement, he said.     reserve bank governor gerhard de kock said the agreement was a "good deal" both for south africa and the banks.     speaking at the same news conference, de kock said the three-year length of the agreement was of "enormous significance" to south africa.     he said south africa had negotiated from a "position of basic economic financial strength."     "we were never overborrowed to begin with and we are now underborrowed by all international criteria that i've ever heard of," de kock said.     du plessis said available foreign reserves of the reserve bank, which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past two months, and a continued current account surplus "will be sufficient" to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement.     du plessis said the banks were showing much more confidence in the south african economy and country as a whole.     he attributed this to "restoration of law and order which has greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also the intensity of unrest."     south africa has been under a state of emergency since june 1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over 2,400 lives in the past three years.     du plessis said no political demands were made by the banks and south africa was now rapidly returning to very good relations with its foreign creditors.     he said there were encouraging signs that some foreign investors were again "taking a more realistic view" of south africa. recent examples were the rise in the financial rand and the sharp increase in foreign exchange reserves, he said.     of the 13 billion dlrs frozen debt 3.5 billion was owed by public sector and 9.5 billion by private industry, du plessis said. the remaining 10 billion consists of seven billion owed by government agencies and three billion by the private sector.  reuter &#3;</h3>
