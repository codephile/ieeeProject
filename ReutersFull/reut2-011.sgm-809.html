	<h3><toshiba information systems (u.k.) ltd>, a unit of japan's toshiba corp <tsba.t> said it planned to enter the u.k. business facsimile and key telephone market, and forecast a turnover of 100 mln stg by 1990 for its full range of office automation equipment.     the announcement comes in the middle of a dispute between the u.k. and japan over the entry of cable and wireless plc <cawl.l> into the japanese market.     toshiba said the introduction of the products indicated its commitment to the u.k. although the market was competitive, the facsimile segement was showing excellent growth.     in japan, cable is battling against proposals to merge a consortium in which it has a 20 pct stake with another group seeking telecommunications contracts.     initial proposals would have given cable a three pct stake. a later suggestion increased this to five pct, but cable said yesterday the idea was still unacceptable.  the dispute is being treated by the u.k. government as a test case of the openness of the japanese telecommunications market.     analysts said the coincidence of the timing of the announcement by toshiba with cable's dispute could increase pressure from the u.k. on japan.     however, they noted that it was not a major move. toshiba already has a sizeable presence in the u.k. while other japanese companies, such as nec corp <nipn.t> has a presence in the key telephone -- telephone systems for businesses -- market.     cable shares were quoted seven pence lower in morning trading at 367p.  reuter &#3;</h3>
