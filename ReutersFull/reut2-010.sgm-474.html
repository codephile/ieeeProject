	<h3>u.s. dealers said the new york federal reserve bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market today buying dollars against yen.     fed officials do not comment on such intervention, but dealers said it appeared that the fed had intervened when the dollar reached 147.50 yen in new york.     the dollar subsequently hovered at 147.55/65 yen.     dealers said they were uncertain about the size of the intervention, but some said it was only for a small amount. they were also uncertain whether the fed intervened on its own account, or if it executed orders for the bank of japan.  reuter &#3;</h3>
