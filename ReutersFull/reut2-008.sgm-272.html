	<h3>sen. david pryor, d-ark., said he was considering amending the senate finance committee's trade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for soybeans, corn and wheat.     pryor told the futures industry association that there was great reluctance among members of the senate agriculture committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the finance panel.     the arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in u.s. cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports.     pryor serves on both the senate finance and agriculture committees.  reuter &#3;</h3>
