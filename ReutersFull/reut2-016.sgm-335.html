	<h3>ncr corp, earlier reporting higher first quarter profit, said it continues to expect that it will report record earnings and revenue for all of 1987.     "our optimism is based on our incoming order rates and the strength of our product lines," the company said.     ncr corp plans additional new product announcements this year, it said without elaborating.     ncr earlier said first quarter profit increased to 61.5 mln dlrs or 65 cts share from 50.2 mln dlrs or 51 cts share in the prior year. ncr's 1986 full-year earnings rose to 336.5 mln dlrs from 315.2 mln dlrs in the prior year.     ncr said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in europe and pacific marketing groups.     growth in u.s. revenues also improved, the company said. first quarter revenues increased to 1.12 billion dlrs from 960.8 mln dlrs in the prior year.     ncr's u.s. dollar value of 1987 first quarter worldwide incoming orders posted a very substantial gain over the prior year first quarter, ncr also said without giving specific figures. order growth was broad based across ncr's product lines, with the greatest growth coming from u.s., it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
