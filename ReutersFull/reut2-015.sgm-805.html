	<h3>the u.s. drilling rig count rose by four last week to a total of 752, against 987 working rigs one year ago, hughes tool co said.     in canada, the rig count continued falling last week because of the government's annual springtime ban prohibiting heavy equipment from being transported over rain-softened highways. a total of 85 rigs were working in canada, down 46 from the previous week, hughes said. at this time last year, a total of 109 rigs were working in canada.     among individual states, louisiana and new mexico each reported drilling declines of 10 rigs and kansas was down by seven. gains were reported in oklahoma, wyoming and texas which increased by 20, seven and one, respectively.     hughes said the total of 752 working rigs in the united states included 17 in inland waters, 74 in offshore waters and 661 on land.  reuter &#3;</h3>
