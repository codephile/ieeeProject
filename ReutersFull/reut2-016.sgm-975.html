	<h3>the swiss national bank sold yen against dollars, joining in concerted intervention by central banks, a spokesman for the national bank said.     he declined to say which central banks had been active in the market, but earlier today tokyo dealers said the bank of japan had intervened at 142.10 yen to the dollar, and market sources here said they believed the bundesbank was in the market as well.     the national bank spokesman declined to specify the volume of its dollar purchases or the rate paid.  reuter &#3;</h3>
