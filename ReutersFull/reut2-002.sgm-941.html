	<h3>the u.s. treasury proposed allowing  temporary imports of south african uranium ore and uranium oxide until july 1 under certain conditions pending clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by congress last fall.     the treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary imports because it felt congress had not intended when it passed the comprehensive south african sanctions bill last fall -- overriding president reagan's veto -- to hurt u.s. industry.     the treasury said an outright u.s. ban of uranium ore and oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their south african origin ore and oxide to other countries including the soviet union for processing.     the treasury also proposed allowing u.s.-origin goods to be imported temporarily from south african state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing in the u.s.     the south african sanctions law, enacted by the u.s. to protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced by south africa's white minority government, prohibited imports of uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel, coal and textiles at the end of 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
