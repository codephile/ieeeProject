	<h3>fuerzas electricas de catalunya (fecsa) suspended repayments of principal on its debts in order to start renegotiating its obligations with banks next month, a company spokesman said.     he said the decision did not affect payment of interest on loans and debentures.     fecsa faces repayments of 60 billion pesetas in interest and 30 billion pesetas in principal this year.     the madrid stock exchange suspended trading in fecsa shares on february 6, saying the company was unable to meet payments on its 594 billion peseta debt.     foreign banks hold almost half the debt.     the spokesman said fecsa was sending telexes to its creditors to set dates for the renegotiation. it would seek longer repayment deadlines and lower interest rates.     he said banks had insisted on a formal declaration that fecsa was suspending principal repayments before discussing a renegotiation of its debts.  reuter &#3;</h3>
