(cindasa) said.     he told reuters the sale price was around 28.95 pesetas per kilo but that the final quantity and delivery date has not yet been set. the corn will be shipped in the coming days from valencia.     he said cindasa will also ship 6,000 to 7,000 tonnes of spanish corn to italy in the second half of this month.     the cindasa spokesman said other corn shipments this month will include between 15,000 and 30,000 tonnes bound initially for rotterdam and ghent and destined for unspecified northern european countries. he said shipments of 35,000 to 50,000 tonnes of low specific gravity barley were also expected this month and added that greece, the netherlands, ireland and belgium were considering imports of spanish flour for milling.     market sources said the corn exports, the absence of imports from the rest of the ec and the delay in shipments of corn from the u.s. had pushed domestic corn prices up by around 0.25 pesetas a kilo today compared with yesterday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
