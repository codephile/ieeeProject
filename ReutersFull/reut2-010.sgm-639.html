	<h3>a senior nicaraguan official said a recent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically disastrous for latin american coffee-producing countries.     nicaraguan foreign trade minister alejandro martinez cuenca was in london to brief international coffee organisation (ico) executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend in managua attended by eight latin american coffee producers to discuss the fall in coffee prices.     london coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in march, to 1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-february.     martinez told reporters the price fall since the ico failed to agree export quotas on march 1 has had disastrous results on latin america, both economically and politically.     he urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by september.     coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under an international coffee agreement, were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought in brazil.     central american economic ministers have estimated the region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in 1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement, martinez said.     he said ico quota talks broke down last month because consumer members lack the political will to fully support commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to producers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
