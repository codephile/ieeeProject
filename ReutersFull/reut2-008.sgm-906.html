	<h3>fairchild industries inc said it will ask stockholders at its april 22 annual meeting to approve its reincorporation in delaware to allow more flexibility to revise its capital structure, among other things. fairchild is now a maryland corporation.     fairchild also cited delaware's recently enacted statutory provisions relating to directors' liability, allowing companies to place limits on liability and expand their ablility to protect corporate officers.     william e. fulwider, company spokesman, said fairchild has no specific plans to alter its capital structure.     fairchild said that if stockholders approve the reincorporation, it would merge into a delaware corporation and its common and preferred would be automatically converted to  the new corporation's shares, without any exchange of stock, along with other assets and liabilities.     fairchild also said the new corporation would retain its fair price charter provision.     earlier this month, fairchild announced that it reached an agreement with the air force to stop production on the t-46a trainer jet.     as a result, fairchild said, it will close its farmingdale, n.y., plant this year and layoff most of the plant's 2,800 employees, about a quarter of its entire workforce.     fairchild reported a 73.6 mln dlr fourth quarter loss mainly due to charges for the plant closing and ending of the trainer jet program. for the year, it reported a 10 mln dlr loss, compared with a loss of 167.1 mln dlrs in 1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
