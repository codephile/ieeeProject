	<h3>honeywell bull inc, owned by honeywell inc <hon>, <cie des machines bull> and <nec corp>, said it expects its 1987 revenues to increase 15 to 20 pct over its current level of about 1.9 billion dlrs.     honeywell bull president jerome meyer also told the press conference the company was profitable, adding the company aimed to improve profits over time.     honeywell inc earlier today received 527 mln dlrs in cash for the sale of 57.5 pct of its computer business to bull and nec. honeywell will retain a 42.5 pct interest in honeywell bull and bull will own an equal amount.     nec owns 15 pct of the company.     meyer, who had been executive vice president of honeywell information systems, said honeywell bull would work closely with nec and bull in both developing new products and marketing computers to multi-national companies.     "we haven't been growing as fast as we'd like, but we are going to turn that around," meyer said. he said business was  soft in the u.s.     he said the company was reorganizing its distribution programs and its staff, reassigning and laying off selected employees. he also said the company was hiring new workers.     honeywell bull chairman jacques stern, who is also chairman of bull, said he believed the computer industry could be a fast growing market for companies that provide the type of computers customers want. "i don't believe in the slump of the market," he said.     the computer company would offer open systems so that customers would not be tied to a specific vendor or architecture, and it will also focus on tying computers together through communications networks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
