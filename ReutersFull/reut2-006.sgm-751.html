	<h3>laidlaw transportation ltd said earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase by "substantially more" than the 30 pct average annual growth experienced in the last four years.     revenues for the year ended august 31 will be about 1.2 billion dlrs, including gsx corp, the u.s. waste services unit acquired from imasco ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, laidlaw president michael de groote told analysts.     last year, laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs, or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.     de groote also said the company expects "excellent results" in the second quarter ended february 28, but would not be more specific.     he said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not include possible further acquisitions and said that the addition of gsx will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988 through fiscal 1990.     de groote said the increased earnings in the previous four quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. the rest came from acquisitions, he said.     laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation, a subsidiary of gsx, within the next few weeks, but this will not make any material contribution to earnings, de groote said.     he also said he is "not very optimistic" about the ongoing negotiations to buy 50 pct of tricil ltd, a toronto-based chemical and solid waste services company with canadian and u.s. operations, from <trimac ltd> of calgary.     de groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the proposed tricil acquisition, laidlaw will decide within the next 30 days whether to stay in the north american chemical waste business through gsx corp.     "we feel it is a profitable business with good growth potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right management," de groote said.     laidlaw financed the acquisition of gsx by its u.s. subsidiary, laidlaw transportation inc, with the proceeds of a 200 mln canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.     de groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in cash by august 31 from the exercise of warrants.     de groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.     the trucking subsidiary in western canada is performing well and there are no plans to sell it, he said.     he would not estimate the contribution of each segment to earnings per share for the year. he also said that further acquisitions of school bus operations in the u.s. are likely within the next few months.  reuter &#3;</h3>
