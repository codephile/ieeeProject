	<h3>two leading senate republicans have urged the white house to name commodity futures trading commission (cftc) commissioner kalo hineman to replace outgoing chairman susan phillips, congressional sources said.     senate republican leader robert dole (r-kan.) and sen. richard lugar (r-ind.), ranking minority member on the senate agriculture committee, both have endorsed hineman for the top cftc post, the sources said.     in addition, lugar has urged white house chief of staff howard baker to recommend mark sullivan, white house associate personnel director, as cftc commissioner, they said.     phillips's departure july 24 will create a vacancy on the five-person commission and require the white house to appoint a new chairman.     earlier this month, sullivan emerged as a leading candidate to replace phillips, according to industry and congressional sources.     but sullivan's lack of experience in commodity markets has been cited as a liability by industry representatives.     hineman, a kansas farmer, has drawn support from dole and other members of the congressional agriculture committees who are eager to have farming interests well represented on cftc.  reuter &#3;</h3>
