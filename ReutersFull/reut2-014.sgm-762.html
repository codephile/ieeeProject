	<h3>the house armed services committee slashed president reagan's funding request for the strategic defense initiative (sdi), approving 1.7 billion dlrs less than he had proposed for the anti-missile program.     the committee, during its consideration of the 1988 defense authorization bill, also cut by more than half reagan's request for a rail system for strategic missiles.     the proposals must be adopted by the full house and senate before becoming law.     the committee approved 3.5 billion dlrs for sdi, a land- and space-based anti-missile defense program commonly known as "star wars." the amount was 1.7 billion dlrs less than the administration request of 5.2 billion dlrs.     the reagan administration has requested a total of 312 billion dlrs for defense in 1988, but congressional leaders have said that will be cut as part of a budget-trimming effort to reduce the huge federal deficit.     in other action today, the committee approved 250 mln dlrs for a rail system for inter-continental ballistic missiles, but did not specify which missile system. supporters have said missiles on such a rail network would be less vulernable to attack than those in fixed underground silos.     the administration requested 590 mln dlrs specifically for a rail-mobile system for the 10-warhead mx missile. but many congressmen, including house armed services chairman les aspin, a wisconsin democrat, favor a smaller mobile missile dubbed the "midgetman."  reuter &#3;</h3>
