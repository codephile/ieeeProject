	<h3>chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson's budget contained virtually everything the government bond (gilts) market had hoped for and is likely to help prices race ahead in coming months, analysts and traders said.     indeed, in the first half hour after lawson completed his speech, gilt prices soared about 1-1/2 points, an extremely sharp gain in such a short period of time. overall, they rose about two points on the day.     "this budget was incredibly bullish for the gilts market," morgan grenfell and co ltd economist stephen bell said.     analysts said that in the light of the reaction to the budget in the gilts and u.k. money markets, u.k. commercial bank base rates are likely to be cut by as much as a full point tomorrow.     analysts said the market's euphoria was simply a reflection of supply and demand. the crucial piece of news in the budget was that the public sector borrowing requirement would be held to 4.0 billion stg.     by comparison, a year ago, the psbr was set at 7.0 billion stg.     the lower psbr means the bank of england will have to offer far less new stock to the market to meet its funding needs and the scarcity factor is sure to drive prices up further, analysts said.     "the psbr at four billion is lower than anyone realistically expected," bell said. most market expectations called for the chancellor to announce a psbr of about 5.5 billion stg.     s.g. warburg securities co ltd economist john shepherd said that overall, the bank will have to sell about two billion less in new securities next fiscal year -- a cut of about 15 pct in total new issue volume.     chase manhattan securities ltd international economist andy wrobleski noted the bank has already raised about 1.8 billion stg of next year's funding needs this year via a series of tap issues.     the issues have been in a partly-paid form where the full price does not have to be paid until the start of the new fiscal year and therefore they are not counted in the current year's fund raising.     but the bank of england will also be constrained from issuing gilts in the conventional form by its promise to try out a u.s.-style auction system in which firms bid for new stock.     the bank will also have to offer at least one index-linked issue where the rate paid to investors is tied to the retail price index, leaving about one to two billion stg, in total, to be raised in the form of traditional stock.     analysts noted that the budget contains provision for a two pence in the pound cut in the basic rate of income tax, in line with most market expectations, although some operators had expected a cut of up to four pence in the pound.     the gilts market approved of the more modest tax cut, shepherd said, because "if it was more than two pct, they would have become concerned about the economy heating up again."     also, a cut of two pence in the pound suggests that if the ruling conservative party is re-elected, another two pence cut can be offered at budget time next year.     analysts said the gilts market may also be building steam on the political implications of the budget which suggests an early election.     "all the goodies in this budget will be in place by the middle of may," morgan grenfell's bell said. "this makes a june election very likely."     bell said some politically popular provisions omitted from the budget, such as lifting the ceiling on the amount of mortgage eligible for tax benefit and some provisions on pensions, could not have been implemented until autumn anyway.     at that rate, they would have been of little use for a political party expecting to call an election in june.     also, analysts noted, the budget does not go overboard with measures that are seen as generous to the wealthy.     "this will be a difficult budget for the (opposition) labour party to attack," shepherd said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
