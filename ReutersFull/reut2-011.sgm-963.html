	<h3>french farmers are planning to cut their maize sowings by between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares this year from the 1.87 mln ha harvested in 1986, the french maize producers' association, agpm, said.     it said its first estimate of planting intentions indicated cuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region of picardy and the paris basin, which harvested 192,000 ha last year.     in the centre-west region of poitou-charentes, plantings were estimated four to seven pct up on last year's harvested 244,000 ha.     planting intentions in the south-east ranged between nine pct less and two pct more than last year's 125,000 ha. in the south-west the agpm said producers intended to plant a similar area to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided water supplies are adequate in the midi-pyrenees region after the last two years of drought.     meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, amsol, said sunflower plantings in france this year are indicated at between 900,000 and 950,000 ha against 829,000 harvested last year, while soya plantings are indicated at 80,000 ha against last year's harvested 48,000.  reuter &#3;</h3>
