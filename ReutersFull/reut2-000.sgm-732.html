	<h3>rospatch corp said it rejected a proposal by diagnostic retrieval systems inc to acquire its stock at 22 dlrs a share.     rospatch's board believes that the long term interests of its shareholders will be best served by continuing as an independent public company at this time, the company said in response to an unsolicited offer from diagnostic retrieval.     rospatch said diagnostic's offer of february 27 is a variation of a previous offer in january, the nature of which was not disclosed.     rospatch said it advised diagnostic retrieval that "it would be contrary to the best interests of the corporation to engage in any discussions concerning a business combination with diagnostic retrieval."  reuter &#3;</h3>
