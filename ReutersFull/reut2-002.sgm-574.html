	<h3><rapid-american corp> said its faberge inc subsidiary was granted approval by federal court to pursue its 11 mln dlr fraud suit against <porterfield buying unit> and its partners.     faberge said the u.s. district court, southern district of new york, reinstituted the suit against porterfield and its partners samuel wyman and grace porterfield, vacating an earlier court decision dismissing the suit.     the suit, filed in 1982, charges porterfield with overcharging commissions and for billing commericals that were promised but never aired, according to the company. faberge alleges that porterfield used fraudulent invoices and schemes which netted it more than 3,500,000 dlrs in illegal profits.     the suit, brought under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act (rico), was dismissed earlier because the court ruled it did not meet certain criteria of the rico act. but an appeals court sent the suit back to district court based on two related decisions involving the rico act, faberge said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
