	<h3>all claims to be settled under a u.k./soviet pact agreed last year in connection with pre-revolutionary russian bonds and seized assets will be treated equally, price waterhouse and co (pw) said.     it said that the treatment for the bonds had not actually been determined, although it had been estimated that holders would receive about 10 pct of the nominal value of the bonds, which was the percentage to be assigned to property claims. now, "the face value of the bond will be added to the value of the property. a dividend will then be calculated and all claims will be treated equally," pw said.     pw administers the russian compensation fund, which was set up by the foreign office in 1917 to oversee some 45 mln stg in pre-revolutionary reserves for claimants of assets seized during the revolution.     pw, which is currently accepting applications for the claims, said that to date, 2,000 bond application forms and 600 property application forms have been returned.     because the number of applications and bonds returned is increasing rapidly, a special office where the claims are being processed will remain open beyond the close of business until midnight on march 31, the deadline for claims to be submitted.  reuter &#3;</h3>
