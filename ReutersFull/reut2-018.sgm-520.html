	<h3><aramco corp> has accepted japanese nominations to lift a higher proportion of arab heavy crude oil under term contracts in july, oil industry sources said.     japanese companies requested a ratio of 80 pct arab heavy to 20 pct arab light under a term contract agreement with aramco for 100,000 barrels per day, the sources said. the contractual ratio is 30 pct heavy crude to 70 pct light.     japanese demand for heavy crude oil has increased substantially since the all japan seaman's union ceased sailing into the northern mideast gulf last month, causing problems with liftings of heavy kuwait and khafji crudes.  reuter &#3;</h3>
