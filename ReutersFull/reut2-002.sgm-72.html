	<h3>seven managers and employees at general mining union corp ltd's kinross mines ltd will face charges of culpable homicide following last year's disaster when 177 gold miners died, the attorney general's office said.     the mineworkers were killed last september at kinross when a fire set off toxic fumes which suffocated miners underground.     three of the accused face alternative charges of breaking safety regulations set out in the mines and works act.     the spokesman said the case would probably be heard in witbank regional court, near kinross, in mid-may.  reuter &#3;</h3>
