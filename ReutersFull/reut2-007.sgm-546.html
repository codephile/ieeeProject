	<h3>federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said the suspension by brazil of its foreign debt payments would not undermine u.s. banks.     but he told reuters after a speech to educators that it was in the interest of u.s. banks to complete debt financing plans soon with brazil and other debtor nations.     "i don't think it's going to undermine public confidence in the banking system from brazil alone," he said. "but i would like to see further progress made on this whole situation."     brazil announced last month it was temporarily suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt owed to private banks, opening a new round in the five-year-old debt crisis.     last week, ecuador suspended interest payments to private foreign banks, which hold about two-thirds of its total 8.3 billion dlr foreign debt, citing severe damage to its oil industry caused by an earthquake.     citicorp <cci> the largest u.s. bank, said last week that it might have to reclassify most of its 4.6 billion dlrs in brazilian loans as non-performing, thus removing them as part of the bank's expected income-producing assets.     analysts said such a move would sharply reduce citicorp's profits and might result in similar measures by brazil's other bank creditors.     volcker said he believed brazil and ecuador want to maintain continuity in their debt service.     "it's fundamentally in their best interest. if they can get the financing and refinancing that's necessary, they may be able to make their economies grow again."     asked whether he expected other nations to follow the path taken by brazil and ecuador, he said the two countries were special cases. he did not elaborate.  reuter &#3;</h3>
