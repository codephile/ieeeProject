	<h3>former white house spokesman larry speakes said he and president reagan misled the public unintentionally on the iran arms scandal because they themselves were misled by others.     in a televised interview, speakes was contrasting the defensive, much-criticized efforts reagan made in early attempts to cool the scandal with the dynamic speech he expected when the president addressed the nation tonight.     "when we went into those press conferences and that nationwide address in november right after the (iran) story broke, the president did not have the proper information," speakes said.     "and that's why we were misled. and consequently, the president and i misled the public, to a certain extent."     "we were badly served by the people that were involved in the iranian crisis and running the show."     asked whom he meant, speakes said former national security adviser robert mcfarlane; mcfarlane successor john poindexter; and then-national security council aide oliver north.     speakes said those three had prepared a false chronology of events "that misled us into thinking that we had all the facts ..."     mcfarlane has said that he, north and poindexter had doctored a white house chronology to obscure and minimize reagan's role in the arms sales. he said they did that as part of an effort to prepare the president for a november 19 news conference.  reuter &#3;</h3>
