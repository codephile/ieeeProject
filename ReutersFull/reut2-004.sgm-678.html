	<h3>china's 1987 cotton output must rise above the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fall short of increasing demand, the china daily said.     demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985.     output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. the china daily attributed the decline to several factors, including less favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict cotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks.     according to customs figures, cotton exports rose to 558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985.     to increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pct the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota levels, the newspaper said. its official purchasing agencies will buy cotton produced in excess of that originally contracted for, it added.     the china daily said all cotton growing areas in south china should be maintained, and growing in the north should be concentrated in hebei, shandong, henan and xinjiang.     it called for comprehensive planning to coordinate production of cotton with that of grain, edible oil and other crops, but gave no more details.  reuter &#3;</h3>
