	<h3>opportunities for medium-sized banks to compete in the face of the increasing centralization of the financial services industry may be dwindling, according to john rau, president of the exchange national bank of chicago.     "we're going to see a continued shaking-out of the banking industry," rau told reuters after a speech to securities analysts and investment advisors.     rau said exchange national bank has concentrated its resources on financial services for medium-sized chicago and midwest businesses, asset-based lending to middle-market companies, and sales and trading of financial services.         "most commercial banks depend on relatively low cost consumer deposits for their income. we decided to move our franchise into a less susceptible niche," rau said.     "nichemanship is a very difficult thing, especially in urban areas where inevitably banking franchises are mass-market oriented," rau said. "the odds are against other banks doing what we have done."     exchange national bank is the principal subsidiary of the exchange international corp. with total assets of 1.9 billion dlrs, it is chicago's fifth largest bank. net income totalled 10.2 mln dlrs or 1.10 dlrs a share in 1986, up from 7.7 mln dlrs or one dlr a share in 1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
