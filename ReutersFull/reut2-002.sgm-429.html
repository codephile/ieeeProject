	<h3>eurotunnel, the anglo-french channel tunnel consortium, will offer potential backers a wide choice of ways to invest in a planned 750 mln stg capital issue later this year, co-chairman alastair morton said.     speaking to reporters after a shareholders meeting, he said eurotunnel would offer "a menu of securities" designed to overcome investor reluctance.     details are still to be worked out but investors could be offered a choice of paying immediately for shares or buying them on a part-paid basis, or buying convertible bonds, or bonds with warrants giving a right to buy shares at a later date, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
