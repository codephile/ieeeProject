	<h3>peru's state minerals marketing arm, minero peru comercial sa (minpeco), lifted a force majeure on zinc ingot shipments from the country's biggest zinc refinery at cajamarquilla, a spokesman said.     the spokesman said the problems affecting sulphuric acid and roaster plants that had halted production since may 4 had been resolved.     however, he said production of zinc ingots this year was expected to fall to around 86,000 tonnes this year at cajamarquilla, from 94,000 tonnes in 1986 because of the stoppage.     the refinery has an optimum annual production capacity of 100,000 tonnes but its highest production was 96,000 tonnes of refined zinc ingots in 1985, the spokesman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
