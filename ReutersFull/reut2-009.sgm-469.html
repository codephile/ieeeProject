	<h3>a leading u.s. farm-state congressman, jerry huckaby, d-la., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.     "we're moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct (the u.s. sugar program)," rep. huckaby, chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues, told reuters in an interview.     huckaby, who told u.s. sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the same message to louisiana sugarcane growers friday. he also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.     huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.     "i think if we're talking about dropping (the quota) another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point where the program might not work," he said.     "ideally, i'd like to freeze things right where we are," said huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in congress.     a freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the u.s. market staying at just over 50 pct, and u.s sugar imports holding at about 1.2 mln tons, huckaby said.     a decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.     "i feel like if we didn't expand production, we could probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program)," huckaby said.     however, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the u.s. sweetener market from just over 50 pct, huckaby said.     he noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the u.s.     but he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share, then u.s. sugar imports might be eliminated and u.s. sugar output severely reduced.     huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as a.e. staley and archer daniels midland soon.     "this program is advantageous to the corn users. they have some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved," huckaby said.     huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled, either through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.     huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the justice department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production.     "i don't know if we will go this route, but if we do there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do that legally?" he said.     asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners, huckaby said "you build a fragile house if you do it that way."     huckaby said he understands why u.s. cane and beet farmers have expanded production, because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain.     but he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would not be good policy.     huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year.     huckaby said congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program.     "the administration proposal is so drastic, that i don't think it will get up a head of steam," huckaby said.     he said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved.     instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program, huckaby said the reagan administration should file a complaint with the general agreement on tariffs and trade against the european community's sugar policy. he said ec policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market.  reuter &#3;</h3>
