	<h3>sandoz ag <sanz.z> would have reported a percentage rise in net profits "close to double figures" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for november's warehouse fire, a senior company official said.     the official, who declined to be identified, told reuters sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the rhine.     sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share.     this year began well, with the performance in january and february at least equal to the same period last year, the official said.     the company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on april 22.     sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident.     the official said the addition to reserves was to cover the "one pct" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire.     sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from switzerland and other countries bordering the rhine since the accident.     however, the official said the final figure would be "much less than that cited in earlier comments." he gave no further details.     in line with fellow chemical giant ciba-geigy <cigz.z>, which reported last month, sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar, the official said.     sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with market share increases in the united states and japan. but this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8.36 billion francs,the sandoz official said.     net profit at ciba-geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs.     the third major swiss chemical company, f. hoffmann-la roche and co <hofz.z> has not yet reported its results.  reuter &#3;</h3>
