	<h3>u.s. attorney rudolph giuliani, clarifying earlier remarks about being offered a top job at the securities and exchange commission, said he had no intention about commenting on whether the offer was made.     a spokeswoman for giuliani said the problems arose because he thought he was responding to questions about newspaper speculation and not about an actual offer.     in a brief morning press conference, giuliani said he had received feelers about becoming head of the fbi and had turned that down. he then mentioned the sec and said he had not made up his mind but could not leave new york for several months.     in a later clarification of his remarks, giuliani told reporters, "i can't comment. i am not able to confirm that. this is not a good time to leave new york. i have important work to do here."     he did not deny that an offer had been made.     earlier reuters reported that giuliani confirmed that he had been offered a top post at the sec but would not say what that position was.   reuter &#3;</h3>
