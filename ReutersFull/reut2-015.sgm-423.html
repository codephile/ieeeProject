	<h3>officials from indonesia, malaysia, singapore and, perhaps, thailand will meet here tomorrow to discuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing and ways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said.     the officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the four countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.     this is the first time indonesia is attending such a meeting, they said, but representatives from thailand may not be able to attend because of their tight schedule. malaysia, indonesia and thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber exports and singapore is a major regional rubber trading centre.     the malaysian rubber futures market, freighting and contracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be discussed.     last month, rubber importing and exporting countries adopted a new international natural rubber agreement in geneva. the new pact is more responsive to market trends than its predecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing the buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.  reuter &#3;</h3>
