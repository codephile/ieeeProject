	<h3>hanson industries, the u.s. arm of hanson trust plc <han>, said it has proposed to sell, in separate transactions, kaiser cement's northwest terminals and montana city plant, to lone star industries inc <lce> and <ash grove cement west inc>, respectively for a total of 50.2 mln dlrs.     hanson said the deals are subject to normal conditions of closing.     hanson industries completed the purchase of kaiser cement on march 3, for about 250 mln dlrs.     hanson said kaiser cement is now an indirect wholly owned unit of hanson trust and forms part of its building products group.     "these sales are a continuation of an asset redeployment program at kaiser cement and will allow kaiser to concentrate its efforts in the california marketplace, where it is the largest cement producer and holds a premiere market position," hanson industries chairman gordon white said.      reuter &#3;</h3>
