	<h3>the commodity futures trading commission (cftc) said the kansas city board of trade's (kcbt) one-minute audit trail system was adequate and accurate.     but in its second rule enforcement review of an exchange's audit trail system, cftc said kcbt needed to provide a more accurate indication of the percent of trades that meet the one-minute timing standard.     cftc also recommended the exchange develop a computerized program to compare time and sales prints to the record of trades in its trade register.  reuter &#3;</h3>
