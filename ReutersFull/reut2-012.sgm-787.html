	<h3>spain has revised some of its main economic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of the economy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its monthly bulletin.     internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a previous target of 3.5 pct.     mariano rubio, governor of the bank of spain, the central bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation target this year. inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.     the forecast for private consumption growth remains unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.     growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.     export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from 5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against the dollar and slack external demand.     slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending has lowered estimated gdp growth to three pct in 1987 from an earlier forecast 3.5 pct. gdp grew by three pct last year.     the economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to five pct, in spite of minister carlos solchaga's doubts last week on whether this target could be maintained if wage settlements continue to rise above the government's recommended five pct ceiling.     unions and employers dispute the average wage increases agreed so far this year. trade unions calculate wage settlements have produced average rises of 7.3 pct against 5.5 pct estimated by the employers' federation ceoe.  reuter &#3;</h3>
