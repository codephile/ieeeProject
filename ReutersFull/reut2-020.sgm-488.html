	<h3>goodman fielder ltd <goow.s> of australia said in a statement that it had acquired 31 mln ordinary shares in ranks hovis mcdougall plc <rhml.l> (rhm), bringing its stake in the company to 29.9 pct or 101 mln ordinary shares.     goodman said it has no intention of making a full bid for the company and would not contemplate doing so over the next six months in the absence of a material change in the circumstances of ranks.     rhm said it regards the stake build-up as a hostile move which is unwelcome and not in the long term interest of shareholders.  reuter &#3;</h3>
