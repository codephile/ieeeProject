	<h3>controversy surrounding u.s.-backed reforms in the inter-american development bank (iadb) underscores the mounting challenge to washington's current debt strategy, according to latin american officials and delegates to the iadb meeting that begins here today.     the bank's policy-making board on saturday postponed a decision on the reforms until june in view of strong latin american opposition to u.s. proposals to strengthen its control over lending to the region.     washington wants to involve the iadb in its debt strategy through increased lending, but as the bank's largest single shareholder it also wants to require countries to adopt far-reaching economic reforms to qualify for loans.     the u.s. push for iadb reforms, which began at last year's meeting in costa rica, is particularly sensitive in an institution latin americans have traditionally thought of as their own.     "it's almost an issue of sovereignty for the latin americans," one iadb official said.     with a 54.2 per cent voting bloc, latin american nations have had relatively easy access to 35 billion dlrs in project loans since the bank's founding in 1959.     the bank has also been run for the past 12 years by a mexican, antonio ortiz mena, who has been increasingly critical of u.s. debt strategy in the last two years.     ortiz mena says commercial banks must renew lending to the region if debtors are to grow and repay creditors. at a news conference last week he warned that latin defaults were a distinct possibility in the long run.     brazil insists its debt service obligations should in no way interfere with growth priorities, a position putting the issue of debt relief squarely into focus for the first time, officials and delegates said.     they said creditors are not ready to discuss debt forgiveness and prefer to look at schemes such as debt-equity swaps in combination with a continuing emphasis on economic reforms.     washington wants the iadb to impose greater conditions on lending, and has threatened to block increased appropriations for the bank if it does not get its way.     latin america, while retaining reservations, now accepts the principle of setting greater conditions on loans, but is unwilling to countenance u.s. demands for greater veto powers on lending, officials and delegates said.     washington has pushed for veto power to be lowered to 35 pct from a simple majority as at present. latin americans are unwilling to go below 40 pct, which would oblige the u.s. to line up two other voters or voting blocs on its side.     this attempt to weaken latin america's voting power, and particularly a threat by washington to reduce funds to the iadb unless its reforms are accepted, has created considerable resentment among latin americans.     "debtors have already shown considerable willingness to sacrifice over the last five years so economic adjustment is not at issue," one latin american official said.     the region has been hoping for a seventh replenishment of iadb resources of at least 20 billion dlrs for 1987-90, as against 15.7 billion for the previous four-year period.  reuter &#3;</h3>
