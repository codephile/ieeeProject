	<h3>foreign exchange market rumours that the the bank of england has been selling sterling to halt its rise prompted a wary response from dealers who said they saw no obvious confirmation, market sources said.     bank of england officials were not immediately available for comment. earlier this week, the bank sanctioned a cut in bank interest rates in a surprise move, which aimed at limiting sterling's rise ahead of the march 17 budget.     but today the pound has strengthened to 72.7 on its trade-weighted index from 72.1 last night, though the u.k. currency is below its day's high against the dollar.  reuter &#3;</h3>
