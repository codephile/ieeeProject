	<h3>nynex corp will urge the u.s. district court to approve justice department recommendations easing restrictions on offering new services by regional telephone firms, chairman delbert staley said.     "while nynex would have prefered the unqualified lifting of all of the modified final judgement restrictions, we intend to urge judge (harold) greene to act as quickly as possible to approve the recommendations," staley told a news conference.     nynex will file its comments with the u.s. district court on friday, he said.     staley referred to justice department recommendations to greene last month that restrictions on manufacturing, information services and out-of-region, long-distance service be eliminated.     referring to information services, staley said, "that certainly is one area we would quickly move into."     electronic mail, voice mail and videotext are some of the services nynex could offer, he added.     nynex disagreed with the department's recommendation to retain restrictions on long-distance service within a local service region, staley said.     the company would like to have the option of providing long-distance service within and outside its region, he said.     "our entry in long-distance would further stimulate competition," staley said.     "we believe it would put downward pressure on consumer costs."      reuter &#3;</h3>
