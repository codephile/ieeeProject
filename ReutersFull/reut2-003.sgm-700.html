	<h3>the west german intervention board said about 100,000 tonnes of sugar have been offered into intervention so far.     a spokesman, speaking from frankfurt, told reuters offers have increased recently but contracts have not yet been concluded. a european commission spokesman in brussels earlier confirmed that one mln tonnes of sugar had been offered to intervention boards in various member states. the intervention board spokesman in frankfurt said, "one million tonnes is an awful lot and the community's coffers are almost empty. this could turn into a serious political problem."     west german trade sources said they believed the one mln tonne offer by the ec sugar industry into intervention would have a neutral market impact overall.  reuter &#3;</h3>
