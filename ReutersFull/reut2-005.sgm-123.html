	<h3>united telecommunications inc said it called for rejection of the recommendation that the regional bell telephone companies be allowed to enter the long-distance business at this time.     in comments to u.s. district court judge harold greene, the company said modification of other restrictions currently imposed on the regionals would be acceptable.     united telecommunications operates u.s. sprint, a long distance telephone service, in a joint venture with gte corp <gte>.     separately, us sprint in its comments told judge green that allowing the bell operating companies into the long-distance business could undo all the strides toward full competition since the breakup of american telephone and telegraph co <t> in 1984.     the u.s. justice department has proposed lifting restrictions on the regional phone companies so they can enter the long-distance business in areas where they do not provide local service.  reuter &#3;</h3>
