	<h3>purchases of west german bonds in january reached a record 13 billion marks' worth as a result of investment from other european countries amid expectations of a european monetary system realignment, the bundesbank said.     this produced a surplus in the securities item of the long-term capital account of 11.17 billion marks and was the primary contributor to a 10.15 billion surplus in the total capital account, turning round december's 6.48 billion deficit.     in january last year, the capital account, combining long and short-term flows, showed a surplus of 2.27 billion marks, the bundesbank said.     the bundesbank said foreign purchase of german shares in january was, by contrast to the massive bond investments, only about 200 mln marks worth, while overseas purchases of "schuldschein" promissory notes fell by 500 mln from december.     the long-term account in total showed a surplus of 11.17 billion marks, reversing the 2.60 billion deficit in december and up from a surplus of 9.37 billion in january, 1986.     among other items, direct domestic investment abroad posted an outflow of 2.86 billion marks after a deficit of 4.98 billion in december and a surplus of 1.13 billion in january last year.     the bundesbank confirmed earlier figures from the federal statistics office that the current account surplus in january fell to 4.86 billion marks from 8.47 billion last year.     the trade surplus in the month was down to 7.20 billion from 11.57 billion in december.     in the invisibles account, the surplus on services was 100 mln marks, turning round a deficit of 500 mln marks in december. the balance on payments transfers narrowed to a deficit of 2.40 billion marks from 2.70 billion.  reuter &#3;</h3>
