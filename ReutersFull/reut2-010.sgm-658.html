	<h3>bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall further.     he told a lower house budget committee in parliament that the bank of japan would continue to cooperate closely with other major nations to stabilize exchange rates.     the central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch on exchange rate movements since last week, he said.     he said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen.     sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between japan and the u.s. over semiconductors.     the yen's tendency to rise will prevent japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
