	<h3>major copper producing and consuming countries are considering a u.s. proposal to set up a study group to review the world copper market, delegates said.     the u.s. initiative was introduced last december at a meeting held here under the auspices of the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad).     the u.s., the world's largest copper consumer and second biggest producer after chile, has proposed setting up a body to improve statistics and market transparency of the copper economy, and provide a forum for discussion.     the new body would not aim at negotiating measures to stabilise depressed world prices.     this week's meeting, which began yesterday, is due to end friday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
