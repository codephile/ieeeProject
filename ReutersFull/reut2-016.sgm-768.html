	<h3>the finance ministry is likely to allow japanese financial institutions here to use overseas financial futures market from next month, bond market sources said.     a senior ministry official declined to give an exact timing, but said he expects removal of the ban on trading in overseas financial futures as soon as possible.     the domestic call for participation in overseas markets to hedge foreign securities holding risks was reinforced by the launch of a night trading session by the chicago board of trade from april 30. the session covers morning trading hours in tokyo.     resident financial institutions are currently not allowed to participate in foreign financial futures markets, although their overseas branches may.     the newly eligible institutions are expected to be securities houses, banks, life insurance companies and investment trusts, the market sources said. but the ministry is likely to prohibit broking business by those institutions and by individuals, the sources said.     in addition corporate investors are expected to be barred initially because of their relative lack of experience.  reuter &#3;</h3>
