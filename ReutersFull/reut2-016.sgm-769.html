	<h3>japan's ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) will call for adequate and flexible management of the nation's monetary polices in its plan to expand domestic demand, a senior ldp official told reuters.     junichiro koizumi, the head of the ldp committee working out the plan, said the phrase should not be taken as implying an immediate cut in japan's 2.5 pct discount rate.     "the ldp generally believes that there is no need for a further discount rate cut at the moment," he said. but koizumi said the ldp does not rule out a rate cut if necessary in the future.     bank of japan governor satoshi sumita told a press conference on wednesday that the central bank does not have any intention of easing credit conditions.  reuter &#3;</h3>
