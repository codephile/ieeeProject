	<h3>after a highly favorable reception of a trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of u.s. wheat flour last february, the senegalese appear ready to take delivery of a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed u.s. wheat, the u.s. agriculture department said.     in its report on u.s. export markets for u.s. grain, the department noted senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat under the export enhancement program last november, but local opposition from millers, accustomed to french wheat, has been delaying deliveries.     as a result there were a series of baking seminars as well as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers and convince key officials of the qualities of u.s. wheat.     the department said if deliveries of u.s. wheat to senegal remain on track, the u.s. could dominate a wheat market that had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly french wheat during the 1987/88 (july-june) season.   reuter &#3;</h3>
