	<h3>the house budget committee approved a package of 23 billion dlrs in taxes and budget cuts to reduce the 1988 budget deficit.     the 20-14 party-line vote by the democratic-controlled committee sends the measure to the full house where house speaker jim wright predicted passage next week.     the package--including 12 billion dlrs in taxes president reagan has vowed to veto--was put together by other committees under a new budget law requiring a 23 billion dlr cut in the deficit to scale down the 1988 budget deficit.  reuter &#3;</h3>
