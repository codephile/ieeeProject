	<h3>the special prosecutor in the iran arms scandal is expected to bring indictments that could include felony charges against senior reagan administration officials, the new york times reported.     it quoted law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation as saying special prosecutor lawrence walsh, who is investigating the scandal, was focusing on three areas.     the paper identified these as conspiracy to defraud the government, obstructing justice and making false statements to the government. it said the prosecutor had not ruled out any suspects, including current and former government officials.     but the paper said walsh, in his investigation of the sale of arms to iran and the diversion of funds to the u.s.-backed contra rebels in nicaragua, was running short of time. this was because congress has begun granting immunity to key figures in the affair to speed up congressional investigations.     the paper quoted one official as saying that, while obstruction of justice was usually hard to prove, evidence of a cover-up "may have been comically obvious here."  reuter &#3;</h3>
