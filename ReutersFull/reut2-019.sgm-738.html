	<h3>intel corp said it has signed a letter of intent with privately-held silicon compiler systems corp under which intel will become a value-added silicon vendor for integrated circuits designed with silicon compiler's genesil silicon compilation system.     under the proposed pact, intel would provide initial silicon foundry services for genesil-based designs.     genesil users would be able to compile their application-specific designs using intel's 1.5-micron complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process.      reuter &#3;</h3>
