	<h3>south korea's purchase of about 2.4 mln tonnes of u.s. corn in the past six months -- close to double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the united states, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic jump, the u.s. agriculture department said.     in its world production and trade report, the department said total south korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season (oct-sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln tonnes from the united states.     during the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln tonnes of u.s. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.     ite appears the koreans are shifting back to u.s. corn in light of competitive u.s. prices and uncertain supplies from china, argentina and south africa, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
