	<h3>french finance minister edouard balladur said that the financial community is closer to arriving at a system of target zones for currencies despite the fact that little is being said about them.     speaking with reporters at the semiannual meetings of the international monetary fund, balladur said, "we are not very far from the notion of target zones, even if we don't say so."     he told reporters that "our ideas are progressing," adding that the finance ministers have been talking about more cooperation on economic policies and on levels around which currencies should stabilize.  reuter &#3;</h3>
