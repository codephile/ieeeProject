	<h3>the u.s. delegation at the international coffee organization (ico) talks on export quotas is planning to leave tomorrow morning, but will ask a representative from the u.s. embassy in london to attend the negotiations if they continue, a u.s. spokesman said.     one delegate said: "if the u.s. delegation is going home and the brazilians are not budging, then there's no negotiation."     a full ico council meeting is set for 1900 hours local for a progress report. opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching an agreement vary widely and several delegates have said the chances of success were almost impossible to gauge.  reuter &#3;</h3>
