	<h3>the european community's annual inflation rate fell marginally to 3.2 pct in may from 3.3 pct in april, the ec's statistics office eurostat said.     prices in the 12-nation bloc rose 0.2 pct in may after 0.6 pct in april. but the annual rate stayed below that of the u.s. for the second month in succession, following the release of figures showing u.s. inflation of 3.8 pct in both april and may.     however, eurostat said the ec was still beaten by japan, where prices were provisionally 0.1 pct lower in may than a year earlier.  reuter &#3;</h3>
