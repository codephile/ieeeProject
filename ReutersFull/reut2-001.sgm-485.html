	<h3>moody's investors service inc said it upgraded to aaa from aa-1 the insurance rating of general electric mortgage insurance co of ohio, a unit of general electric co.     moody's said this reflected the strengthening of terms in a revised net worth agreement between gemico and its immediate parent, general electric credit corp, whose long-term unsecured debt is also a top-flight aaa.     however, the rating agency said the agreement does not benefit other gemico affiliates in california, florida and north carolina.  reuter &#3;</h3>
