	<h3>the green coffee market saw some demand for high quality coffees in the past week, but business was described as generally unsatisfactory, trade sources said.     especially sought were spot east african and ethiopian and some brazils, they said, adding that some high grade robustas also met some demand.     sporadic business was noted in the second hand which offered kenya coffee for may/june shipment up to 25 dlrs below origin levels.     roasters are said to be well covered and are not expected to enter the market for larger purchases in the near term.  reuter &#3;</h3>
