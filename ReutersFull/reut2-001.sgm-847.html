	<h3>a meeting among government agencies today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the united states to a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the european community, u.s. trade officials said.     representatives of the major government agencies agreed at a trade policy review group meeting, which includes officials of the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressure on ec member states.     "we (all agencies) are together on this," said one u.s. trade official.     one source said the u.s. would continue to make clear to member states and to the ec commission that if brussels proceeds with the vegetable oils tax "there will be a great cost."     u.s. officials said no formal list of european products on which the u.s. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up.     "i don't think we're at that point yet," said one trade official, adding that the ec has only begun deliberations on its farm price package.     suzanne early, assistant trade representative, told reuters the interagency meeting was to discuss u.s. strategy on the vegetable oils issue. asked about retaliation, she said "sometimes its better not to be specific."     u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter monday warned another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the ec proceeds with the vegetable oils tax.  reuter &#3;</h3>
