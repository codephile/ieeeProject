	<h3>harbour workers said they will strike for 24 hours on monday, effectively closing all new zealand's ports.     the strike is over deadlocked wage negotiations.     a harbour employees workers' union spokesman told reporters there will be no ship movements in and out of ports from midnight on sunday (1200 hrs gmt march 15).     there will be no loading or unloading involving harbour board workers and the cook strait ferries, which provide a vital link between new zealand's north and south islands, will not run, he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
