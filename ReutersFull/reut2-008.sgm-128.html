	<h3>world bank president barber conable should prod the government of president suharto towards further economic change, the jakarta post newspaper said.     "conable could do indonesia a great service if he is straightforward enough to point his finger at shortcomings that could be corrected," it said in an editorial.     the english-language paper said the bureacracy was not aggressive or imaginative in responding to indonesia's economic problems, which include fiscal restraints due to drastically declining oil revenues, increasing unemployment, and marketing problems for its major export commodities.     the paper said indonesia must boost the scope for private business initiative as well as stepping up its use of aid money already committed. the world bank has lent indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years.     conable arrived here on saturday and will have talks with suharto tomorrow. today he was returning to jakarta from a visit to world bank-funded projects in eastern java, and was scheduled to meet leading economic ministers in the afternoon.     western diplomats said they expected conable to press indonesia to maintain the pace of its present economic reforms to cope with the slump in its oil revenues.  reuter &#3;</h3>
