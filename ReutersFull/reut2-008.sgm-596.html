	<h3>taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, swollen by strong trade surpluses to a record 53 billion u.s. dlrs, are becoming a problem, government officials said.     official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on march 4 and about 26 billion in late march 1986.     central bank governor chang chi-cheng told reporters the increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by the bank on the local interbank market. it bought nearly two billion u.s. dlrs between march 5 and 23, he said.     wang chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's council for economic planning and development, told reuters the rising reserves were "a big headache for taiwan."     he said the government expects heavier pressure from the u.s., where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as taiwan and japan with large trade surpluses with the u.s.     wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products, especially those from the u.s.     wang said the measures aim at helping reduce taiwan's trade surplus, which rose to 2.73 billion u.s. dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the u.s.     vice economic minister wang chien-shien agreed with wang's remarks and said efforts to avert u.s. protectionism were running out of time. "we must do it quickly or face retaliation from washington," he said.     he said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for u.s. companies.     chang chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying u.s. dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses.     he said the bank is studying revision of the foreign exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls, but declined to give details.     the taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the u.s. dollar since september 1985. it opened at 34.38 to the u.s. dollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in june and to 32 by end-year, some foreign bankers said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
