	<h3>bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said the present foreign exchange market instability will not last long as there is caution in the market regarding the rapid decline of the u.s. unit.     he told reporters the major currency nations are determined to continue their concerted intervention whenever necessary to stave off speculative dollar selling in line with their february 22 currency stability agreement in paris.     sumita also said he did not see the recent dollar drop as anything like a free-fall.  reuter &#3;</h3>
