	<h3>smithkline beckman corp said it is pursuing a three-point stragey that will achieve a 10 pct annual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainder of the decade.     in 1986, smithkline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs per share on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs.     the company said in its annual report that its nonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meeting its earnings growth target, and will in fact grow faster than its pharmaceutical business.     smithkline, whose major product is the antiulcer medication tagamet, said in the report that it intends to improve earnings from existing products, expand its product portfolio and optimize its financial resources.     to bolster its position in the antiulcer market, in which tagamet has met stiff competition, smithkline said its strategy to develop an over-the-counter version of tagamet is bolstered by two joint ventures, one with <wellcome plc>, and one pending venture in japan.     smithkline also said its allergan inc eye and skin care products division can be a one billion dlr organization in the next five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct annually.     "nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility," gavin herbert, president of the eye and skin care product group said in the report. in 1986, allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln dlrs.     it said its smith kline and french laboratories pharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, will file for food and drug administration marketing approval for a number of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogen activator, over the next two years.     it also said sk and f's u.s. sales force will be 20 pct larger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel.     smith kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing unit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests a year, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in testing for the aids antibody.     smith kline said that depending on its share price and the cost of money, it may buy back more shares. in the last three years, it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares.     smithkline begins the year with a new management team, including its new chief operating officer george ebright.  reuter &#3;</h3>
