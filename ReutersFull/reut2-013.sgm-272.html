	<h3>u.s. commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said the dispute between the u.s. and japan over computer chips will not develop into a full-scale trade war.     "i think both sides will try and make sure that this doesn't start a trade war -- as a matter of fact i'm positive that there won't be a trade war with japan," baldrige said in a television interview.     president reagan last week imposed penalties over japan's alleged failure to adhere to a july 1986 agreement to stop selling semiconductors in third countries at below cost and to open its own market to u.s.-made chips.     despite tokyo's displeasure with the penalties, baldrige said japan would refrain from taking retaliatory steps that would lead to a trade war, largely because japan itself would have the most to lose in such a conflict.     "japan, i think will -- because they have the means to do it -- face up to the fact that as the second largest industrial trading power in the world they have to live up to their responsibilities of free trade," he said.     "i think we'll work our way out of this," he added. "it's not going to be easy. but i guarantee you, we're not going to have a trade war."  reuter &#3;</h3>
