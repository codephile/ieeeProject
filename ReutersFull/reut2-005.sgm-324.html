	<h3>britain's ruling conservatives have a nine point lead over the main opposition labour party, their biggest in two years, according to an opinion poll published yesterday in the sunday times.     the mori poll's findings were the latest in a series of setbacks for labour and are bound to encourage talk that prime minister margaret thatcher may call a general election in june.     the poll gives the conservatives a rating of 41 pct against 32 pct for labour and 25 pct for the centrist liberal-social democratic alliance -- enough to give thatcher an overall majority of 46 seats in the 650-seat house of commons. the poll follows a survey by marplan last week giving the conservatives a six-point lead over labour.  reuter &#3;</h3>
