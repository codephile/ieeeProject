	<h3>the u.k. government bond market closed showing severe losses ranging to almost 1-1/2 points as sharp falls for u.s treasury bonds resulting from pronounced dollar weakness exacerbated existing uncertainty, dealers said.     selling was described as relatively modest, although very few buyers appeared to take up the slack. much of the momentum was derived from the futures market, where a high 33,074 lots were traded in the long gilt june contract.     the treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 closed 1-7/16 point lower at 135-20/32 stg pct while the treasury 10 pct due 1991 ended at 105-12/32 for a fall of 1-3/16.     dealers noted that market confidence had already been at a low ebb, with much of the recent impressive rise whittled away last week as investors reacted nervously to opinion polls showing unexpectedly strong gains for the centrist liberal/social democratic alliance.     the market had been sustained in large part during its recent rally by a virtual conviction that the ruling conservative party would first call and then win a general election early this summer.     however, advances credited to the alliance last week have cast doubt on both assumptions.     "turnover in the cash market has actually been quite small," one dealer said, adding that price movements had been very volatile at times.     after losing ground heavily in the far east in tandem with the flagging dollar, u.s. bonds fell further in london trading but showed some signs of recovery late in the u.s. morning as the dollar steadied a little against the yen. the latest period of weakness for the dollar has accentuated fears that currency risk might induce japanese investors in particular to undertake dramatic reductions in their portfolios of u.s. treasury issues.     dealers noted that early strength in the index-linked sector of the market, which had enabled the government broker to supply some of both index-linked stock tranches announced on friday, had soon fallen prey to the general depression affecting gilts.     the treasury 2-1/2 pct index-linked stock due 2020 closed just under one point lower at 100-11/32 stg pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
