	<h3>prices rose on the danish bond market after prime minister poul schlueter said the government was prepared to impose further austerity measures to limit domestic consumption if the economy did not improve over the summer.     a typical 20-year mortgage bond had risen to 81 by noon from 79-1/4 at the close last night. "it is because of possible optimism that the government will intervene if necessary," one dealer told reuters.     schlueter said after a routine cabinet meeting yesterday "if economic tightening up is necessary, we will do it."     the government has already imposed three austerity packages since december 1985, in an attempt to bring down the external current account deficit, which rose to a preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion the previous year.     schlueter made clear that an autumn general election would not make the government postpone any austerity measures. the government has to call an election by january 1988.     he expressed surprise at concern in some financial quarters over the level of private and public wage settlements last month, worth a minimum three to four pct a year. these would lead to higher productivity, schlueter said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
