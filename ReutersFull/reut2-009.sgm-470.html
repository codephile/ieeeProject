	<h3>fiat spa <fiat.mi> said it had no plans to issue eurobonds linked to shares still held by banks after the placement of the 15 pct libyan stake in fiat last autumn, a company spokesman said.    "an eventual issue of bonds convertible into fiat shares is not our responsibility," the spokesman told reuters. "in case the operation should be finalized, the bonds would be issued by banks and not by fiat, the spokesman said.     the spokesman was commenting on west german press reports that fiat is considering a eurobond issue of up to 384 mln dlrs, convertible or with warrants attached for exercise into its shares still held by the banks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
