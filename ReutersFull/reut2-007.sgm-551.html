	<h3>copper shipments are likely to be delayed because of power problems at <philippine associated smelting and refining corp> (pasar), the country's only smelter, a company official said.     asked to confirm reports by new york copper trade sources about pasar's shipment problems, marketing manager deogracias madrid told reuters, "they are partly correct. there could be a probable delay."     madrid declined to give more details, or production and export figures, saying the information could lead to speculation.     pasar's smelter is in the central province of leyte.     the new york trade sources said if pasar's shipments were delayed, customers might have to turn to the london metal exchange for supply.     "we have a commitment to our customers and i would not like to comment on that," madrid said.     a spokeswoman for the chamber of mines said philippine copper production amounted to 222,644 tonnes in 1986, down slightly from 226,157 tonnes in 1985. she said production in the first two months of 1987 totalled 34,550 tonnes, compared with 36,462 tonnes in the same 1986 period.  reuter &#3;</h3>
