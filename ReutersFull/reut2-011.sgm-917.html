	<h3>thyssen ag <thyh.f> expects a fall of between 15 and 20 pct in consolidated turnover in 1986/87, chief executive dieter spethmann said.     he told journalists the exact decline would depend on dollar developments. the thyssen group did over 50 pct of its business outside west germany.     spethmann made no comment on 1986/87 group earnings. world group net profit fell to 370.1 mln marks in the year ended september 1986 from 472.4 mln a year earlier on group sales which fell to 40.00 billion marks from a previous 44.32 billion.     last week spethmann told the annual meeting thyssen expected to post a good profit in 1986/87 despite expected losses in the mass steel-making operations this year.     spethmann said engineering turnover would not be lower this year, but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel turnover and sales volume. this would also affect thyssen's trading operations, he said.     spethmann also categorically denied a magazine article published this week which spoke of a dispute between him and heinz kriwet, management board chairman of thyssen stahl ag, over planned job cuts in steel plants in the ruhr area.  reuter &#3;</h3>
