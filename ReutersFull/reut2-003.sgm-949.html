	<h3>the mexican secretariat of commerce has told the u.s. that recent implementation of a 10 pct ad valorem tariff for fixed vegetable oils, fluid or solid, crude, refined or purified, was not targeted at sunflower oil, the u.s. agriculture department said.     in its world production and trade report, the department said the increase in tariffs on this category which includes sunflower, corn and rapeseed oils, was a reaction to importers using basket categories to avoid paying tariffs on specific high-tariff products.  reuter &#3;</h3>
