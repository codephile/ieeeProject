	<h3>the new york mercantile exchange, nymex, has adequate trade practice surveillance and disciplinary programs, but could take steps to improve them, the commodity futures trading commission, cftc, said.     in a rule enforcement review, cftc said nymex was able to identify possible "violative market activity" and that investigations were generally thorough.     however, the commission faulted the exchange for limiting access to its computer-assisted trade practice surveillance system and recommended nymex enhance its computerized surveillance system.     cftc also found nymex had an adequate disciplinary program, but noted that the disciplinary process sometimes was delayed because of failure to promptly schedule hearings.  reuter &#3;</h3>
