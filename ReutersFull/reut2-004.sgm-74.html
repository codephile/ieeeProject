	<h3>swedish mining and metals group boliden ab <blds st> forecast a return to profitability during 1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened by a massive write-off.     the company, which consolidated the swedish wholesale and investment conglomerate <ahlsell ab> this year, said the result included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns.     "these costs have arisen as a results of a change of direction for the group. they are mainly one-off but they have burdened the annual accounts," the company said in a statement.     boliden said the company's liquid assets were 1.36 billion crowns at year-end which together with an investment portfolio of 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid swedish companies.     as a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed cancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return to profitability during 1987, the statement added.     swedish tyres, process equipment and components firm <trelleborg ab> has taken a majority stake in boliden since the beginning of this year. trelleborg then said it had no plans for consolidating boliden.  reuter &#3;</h3>
