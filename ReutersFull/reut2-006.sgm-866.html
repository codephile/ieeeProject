	<h3>shearson lehman brothers inc said it has sold a new type of certificate of deposit designed to provide top-rated japanese banks with broader access to the u.s. money markets.     the investment banker said its variable money market certificates of deposit are structured as traditional floating rate cds, with the rate based on the aa commercial paper composite rate of the federal reserve bank of new york.     shearson said it offered the novel cds yesterday to mostly institutional investors. the series totaled 500 mln dlrs and was oversubscribed with nearly two billion dlrs in bids.     the first banks to issue the variable money market cds were sanwa bank ltd, sumitomo trust and banking co ltd, dai-ichi kangyo bank ltd, fuji bank ltd and sumitomo bank ltd, each with tranches of 100 mln dlrs, shearson detailed.     the investment banking firm said another series of variable money market cds is planned for april.     "the variable money market cds provide a low cost dependable source of funds for issuing japanese banks," said robert shapiro, executive vice president with shearson lehman commercial paper inc. "the instrument enables banks to diversify their funding base in a significant way."     in yesterday's series, the issuing banks' coupon rates were set at the commercial bank composite rate plus a spread which is expected to equal an all-in-cost of libor minus 10 basis points, shearson said.     the rate will be reset monthly or quarterly and will be subject to a maximum of libor and a minimum of the new york fed's commercial paper composite rate.     shearson stressed, however, that the spread over the commercial paper index to be paid by an issuing bank will be determined by investor demand. it added that other japanese banks may participate in future issues.     "for the first time, they (the banks) will gain access not only to traditional cd investors but also to commercial paper investors at rates which are competitive with traditional floating rate cds," said michael balaban, a vice president with shearson's commercial paper unit.     he added, "for u.s. investors, the cds are attractive because they are domestically issued paper with competitive rates offered by aaa-rated japanese banks."     balaban noted that several fiduciary investors and money market funds which had never previously purchased japanese bank paper submitted bids during yesterday's sale.  reuter &#3;</h3>
