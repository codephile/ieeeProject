	<h3>texas air corp's eastern airlines said it will offer low fare, night-time service from chicago's o'hare international airport to 18 u.s. cities.     it had previously offered similar service out of houston.     the company said one-way fares range from 39 dlrs to st. louis to 89 dlrs to los angeles, san francisco and other cities. they are available at all times with no restrictions.     flights depart between 0100 and 0415 cst and arrive around 0600 local time. normal baggage checking services are not available because the flights carry air freight cargo so passengers are limited to two pieces of carry-on baggage.      reuter &#3;</h3>
