	<h3>the u.n. food and agriculture organisation (fao) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.     fao said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in 1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the soviet union, drought in china and reduced plantings in north america.     world cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the impact of reduced production. but stocks are unevenly distributed, with about 50 pct held by the u.s.     "thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many developing countries, particularly in africa, depend crucially on the outcome of this year's harvests," fao said.     fao said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986 harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.     fao's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of substantial buying by china and the soviet union.  reuter &#3;</h3>
