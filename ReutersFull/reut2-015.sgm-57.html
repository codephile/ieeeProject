	<h3>world output of staple foods maintained growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and most of the increase was in developing countries, the director general of the u.n.'s food and agriculture organisation (fao) said.     speaking to fao's committee on world food security, edouard saouma said sub-saharan africa registered a cereal production increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the far east also continued to increase production.     despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face problems in paying for all the food they need, he said.     saouma said many of the developing world's food problems were the result of "chaotic" world trade.     he said it was vital to promote employment to improve the "food-security situation" of the poor, with policy reforms in developing countries to remove existing disincentives to production so that agriculture could play a greater role in stimulating economic growth.  reuter &#3;</h3>
