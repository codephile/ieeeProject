	<h3><bond corp international ltd>, a subsidiary of the australian-based bond corp holdings ltd <bona.s>, said it would defer its planned rights issue but still wants the issue to be made before july 31.     no date has been set for the issue, announced in january.     in a document to shareholders, bond corp said the delay follows its receipt of a 240 mln h.k. dlr loan from its parent company to meet the first payment on the newly acquired bond centre commercial complex in central hong kong.     it also wants outside partners to take up to 50 pct in the project, the company said.     the january announcement said the rights issue would finance bond corp's 1.4 billion dlr acquisition of a 23.77 pct stake in hk-tvb ltd <tvbh.hk> from film magnate run run shaw.     the company then reached an agreement with a consortium led by sino land co ltd <sino.hk> to buy a commercial complex that is still under construction for 1.9 billion dlrs.     bond international said in the document that except for the 240 mln dlr loan, the deal would be financed from internal resources and by selling an interest in the building.     the payments must be completed by the end of 1987.     bond international has also sold several residential buildings in hong kong's mid-levels district for a total of 68.35 mln dlrs, the statement said.     the flats were among the properties it bought last year from hongkong land co ltd <hkld.hk> for 1.4 billion dlrs.     analysts said bond international is heavily geared as it has relied on bank borrowings to purchase both the hongkong land properties and the hk-tvb shares.     bond international also said in the document that while it plans to sell an interest in the complex it will hold the hk-tvb shares as a long-term investment.  reuter &#3;</h3>
