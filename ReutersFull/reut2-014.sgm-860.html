	<h3>the bank of england said it forecast a shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.     among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will remove around 194 mln. in addition, a rise in note circulation and bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110 mln stg.     partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add some 690 mln stg to the system today.  reuter &#3;</h3>
