	<h3>malaysia said the success of talks opening today on a new international natural rubber agreement (inra) depends on how flexible consumer countries are.     rubber producer and consumer countries meet for 12 days in geneva from tomorrow to try to hammer out a rubber pact after they failed to reach agreement last november to replace the current accord, which expires next october.     primary industries minister lim keng yaik said in a statement that malaysia wants to continue with a second inra and is prepared to accept modifications that would strengthen the present agreement.     he said the second inra would allow for an orderly disposal of the accumulated buffer stock of 375,000 tonnes, since the market is now capable of absorbing such releases.  reuter &#3;</h3>
