	<h3>the solution of the world's debt crisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence of protectionism is the biggest danger, the president of the federal association of german banks, wolfgang roeller, said.     roeller, who is also management board spokesman of dresdner bank ag, said in a radio interview it is unlikely brazil's suspension last month of part of its interest payments would lead to a chain reaction in latin america.     it is important to increase the efficiency of debtor countries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from exports to repay foreign debt, he said.     brazil had taken a unilateral step, roeller said, but brazil had a strong and broad economic base. with the help of appropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring back financial stability to that country.     roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken now. it could not be expected debtor countries would be able to repay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions improved. programmes had to be developed which would strengthen the economic position of these countries, to ensure world economic growth so they are able to sell their products at adequate prices.     roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in coordination with governments, international organisations such as the world bank and the international monetary fund, and creditor banks.     "this is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banks alone," he said. one aim had to be to raise the credit standing of debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise funds on international credit markets again. he said a whole set of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced the international banking system would provide more funds, but the problem is not just economic but also political.  reuter &#3;</h3>
