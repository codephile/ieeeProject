	<h3>brazil wants to resume interest payments on its medium- and long-term foreign debt as soon as possible and is willing to discuss ways of softening the impact of the payments suspension on bank earnings, central bank governor francisco gros said.     gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his first meeting with brazil's bank advisory committee since he was appointed last month, also promised a clear statement of brazil's economic policy would be made in the next few days.     but bankers who attended the meeting with gros said it was inconclusive.     the bankers also expressed disappointment gros could not give assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.     "it was all very tentative. you can't expect to get very far at the first meeting," one banker said.     the meeting took place on the eve of the annual meeting here of the inter-american development bank.     the most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need for a legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbank credit lines extended to brazilian banks which expire at the end of march.     brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enough credit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needs to request a formal extension of the commitments to head off possible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.     the issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee will endorse brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide or simply relay it without comment.     this delicate question was not resolved at yesterday's meeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitable language for a telex by midweek, gros and the bankers said.     gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originally matured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on april 15. bankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money is subject to the moratorium.     once interest on brazil's debts becomes more than 90 days overdue, u.s. and canadian banks must put the loans on non-performing basis and may book payments only as and when they are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.     citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarter would be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put brazil on a cash basis. other u.s. banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.     gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible and said he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see if there was a way round the problem.     he did not elaborate. but, asked whether a bridge loan might be arranged to pay the interest, he said, "it could happen."     bankers said this possibility had not been raised at the committee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent with brazil's determination to find a long-term solution to the problem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.     gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at a time is not very useful. only if brazil has access to new loans can it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.     "if the flow of funds dries up, a country like brazil can't meet all its obligations," he said.     gros defended brazil's recent economic record, noting inflation slowed in february, the trade surplus rose and the public sector budget was in operational surplus.     but he said there was a need to spell out government policy, especially on prices.     "it's necessary to clarify policy for internal and external reasons," he said, but declined to say what economic measures might be introduced.     once policy is in place, gros said financing talks with the banks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoed by the country's creditors.  reuter &#3;</h3>
