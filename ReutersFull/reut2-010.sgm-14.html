	<h3>a majority of european community (ec) member states are either against or have strong reservations over a tax on both imported and domestically-produced oils and fats proposed by the european commission, senior diplomats said.     they said a special committee of agricultural experts from ec member states had voiced strong objections over the measure during a meeting charged with preparing the ground for the annual ec farm price-fixing which begins next monday.     they added that only france and italy had indicated they would support the commission proposal which would lead to a tax initially of 330 ecus per tonne during the 1987/88 price round.  reuter &#3;</h3>
