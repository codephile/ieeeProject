	<h3>french foreign minister jean-bernard raimond predicted in a published interview a successful end to negotiations to admit gulf petrochemical exports into the european community (ec).     negotiations have been under way between the community and the six-nation gulf cooperation council (gcc) for three years.     raimond, due here tomorrow from oman for his first official visit to the united arab emirates (uae), told the semi-official daily al-ittihad he was confident a solution would soon be reached.     "i am confident that problems between the two big partners, the gcc and the ec, will find a solution. i will work to reach that solution," he said in the interview conducted in paris.     an ec decision to impose tariffs on gulf petrochemical exports over a set quota has strained trade relations between the two sides.     gcc members saudi arabia, kuwait, bahrain, qatar, the uae and oman are threatening to impose heavy customs duties on european exports to the gulf if no solution is reached.     raimond said negotiations between the two groups took a long time because there were 20 countries involved. but added: "time is now ripe and all circumstances are appropriate for making crucial progress."     referring to the iran-iraq war, he said efforts should continue to find a solution despite prevailing difficulties.     he said france was continuing negotiations with iran. some problems were solved as a result of the contacts while others remained unresolved. he gave no details but said: "france wishes to have normal relations with iran."  reuter &#3;</h3>
