	<h3>vneshtorgbank, the soviet foreign trade bank, is seeking an increase to 250 mln stg from the original 150 mln for a five year, sterling bankers' acceptance facility arranged last autumn, lloyds merchant bank ltd said as arranger.     the facility has a 10 basis point facility fee and there is a 15 basis point maximum cap on the margin.     banking sources said syndication for the increase was proceeding very well so far, although the syndication would not necessarily be confined to banks participating in the original group.     banking sources said that one reason for the increase was that vneshtorgbank had been very impressed by the relatively low cost of financing by means of eligible bills, rather than through more traditional instruments priced in relation to london interbank offered rates (libor).     the facility is vneshtorgbank's first ever sterling-denominated bankers' acceptance facility.     banking sources noted that vneshtorgbank now has two facilities in the market, since first chicago ltd was awarded a mandate last week to arrange a 200 mln dlr, eight year loan at 1/8 point over libor.  reuter &#3;</h3>
