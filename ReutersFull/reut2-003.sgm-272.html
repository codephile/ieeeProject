	<h3>dutch food retailer ahold nv <ahln.as> expects unchanged profits in 1987 but said it will take advantage of the lower dollar to expand further in the u.s.     turnover will grow but net profits are expected to remain around the 1986 level of 132.4 mln guilders due to higher dutch taxes and a three-year expansion plan, ahold chairman albert heijn told a news conference.     the profit forecast allows for a dollar rate around current levels of just over three guilders.     turnover and net profit in 1986 were hit by the dollar, which fell to an average 2.46 guilders from 3.35 in 1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
