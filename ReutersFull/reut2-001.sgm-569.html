	<h3>poland's winter wheat is likely to survive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be known until late april, the polish meteorology institute said.     some varieties of winter wheat sown in poland can survive ground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees c, spokesman teresa tomaszewska told reuters.     even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly melted in february, air temperatures down to minus 30 c should not be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still be damaged by cold spells in march and april, when young shoots may be exposed to night frosts.  reuter &#3;</h3>
