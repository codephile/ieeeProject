	<h3>rlr financial serivces inc said the national association of securities dealers intends to delist it because the nasd beleieves market sales of rlr's broker/dealer subsidiary, rlr securities group inc, are not being made under an effective registration statement, as required by the securities act of 1933.     rlr said the nasd intends to delist it on march 12 unless rlr demonstrates compliance with the law.     rlr said it believes the action is without merit because there is an effective registration statement for the rlr financial securities involved, and it intends to defend itself in the matter.     rlr said it has asked the nasd to stay any deletion of its securities from nasdaq pending its continuous review of the matter and a possibility of a hearing on the merits.     rlr said it has stopped market making in its own securities pending resolution of the matter.  it said a delisting from nasdaq could have an adverse effect on the market and prices for its securities.  reuter &#3;</h3>
