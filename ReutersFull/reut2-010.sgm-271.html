	<h3>the <british petroleum co of australia ltd> reported a 16.15 mln dlr net loss for 1986 against a 73.38 mln dlr profit in 1985 after sales fell to 2.27 billion dlrs from 2.94 billion.     the british petroleum co plc <bp.l> unit attributed the deficit to stock losses arising from the drop in crude prices in the first half, when it made a 119.93 mln dlr loss.     it said government compensation, in the form of subsidies to refiners to partially cover stock losses, together with improved crude prices in the second half, enabled the group's oil business to make a modest pre-tax profit.     bp australia said it had not recommended a dividend.     commenting on the year's performance, the company said it suspended operations at the 60 pct-owned agnew nickel mine because of losses sustained from declining nickel prices.     the results also included an 11.3 mln dlr extraordinary writedown on the value of the laid-up oil exploration drillship regional endeavour.     bp australia said it had sold its 33-1/3 stake in chemical maker <csbp and farmers ltd> yielding an extraordinary profit of 18.9 mln dlrs and expected to finalise the sale of the 80 pct-owned <kwinana nitrogen co> in the first half of 1987.  reuter &#3;</h3>
