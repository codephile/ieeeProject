	<h3>france's economic and social council (ces), an advisory body comprising industrialists, trade unionists and representatives of other sectors of the french economy, said the country's annual growth may not reach two pct in 1987.     french gross domestic product risks not reaching the two pct growth registered last year, the council said in a report on first quarter 1987 economic activity without giving any specific forecasts. finance minister edouard balladur was quoted today as saying that french 1987 growth will probably be about two pct.     balladur said in an interview with the financial daily les echos that the country's economic growth will probably be about the same as last year due to a less favourable international environment.     ces president philippe neeser said one of the major fears for the french economy this year was a resurge in inflation.     disinflation was an absolute priority, neeser told journalists, adding that a failure to do this would be extremely serious as if would be very difficult to reverse for many years.  reuter &#3;</h3>
