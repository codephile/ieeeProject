	<h3>the customs bureau has begun to levy on bond on certain japanese goods pending a final decision by president reagan on april 17 on imposing the planned 100 pct tariff on the shipments, the bureau said.     a bureau official said bonding began on march 31 and if the penalties are imposed as expected after a period of comment, they will retroactive to that date.     the penalties are to be levied on variety of electronic items in retaliation for japan's failure to comply with a july 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in third nations and to open its home market to u.s. goods.  reuter &#3;</h3>
