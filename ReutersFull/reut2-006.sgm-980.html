	<h3>the bank of england said it forecast a shortage of around 450 mln stg in the money market today.     among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 650 mln stg while a rise in note circulation will take out around 30 mln stg.     partly offsetting these outflows, bankers' balances above target and exchequer transactions will add some 200 mln stg and 35 mln stg to the system respectively.  reuter &#3;</h3>
