	<h3>schweizerische aluminium ag <aluz.z>, alusuisse, plans to reduce share and participation certificate capital by 50 pct to cover losses in 1986 and those carried forward from the previous year, chief executive hans jucker said.     jucker told a news conference that the greatest drain on its financial resources had been stopped, but after extraordinary charges the net loss of 688 mln francs in 1986 was only slightly under the 756 mln loss of the previous year.     the losses in 1986 and those carried over from 1985 made it necessary to reduce capital by 50 pct, he said.     however, jucker said the company improved liquidity through a recovery in cash flow and conversion of 300 mln swiss francs of credit into a subordinated loan.  reuter &#3;</h3>
