	<h3>south africa's state-owned energy firm soekor said it would continue tests after striking oil some 120 kms (75 miles) south-southwest of mossel bay.     during production tests, about 5,000 barrels of oil and five mln cubic feet of gas per day were produced, it said.     "this oil discovery will be followed-up as soon as possible by further seismic surveys and drilling. should further drilling and tests in the area yield positive results oil production from a floating platform could be considered."     director general of mineral and energy affairs louw alberts announced the strike earlier but said it was uneconomic.  reuter &#3;</h3>
