	<h3>the unilever plc and nv <un.a> group saw improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the anglo-dutch group said in its results statement.     very good progress was made last year, while the recent acquisition of chesebrough-pond's inc <cbm.n> was a significant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come.     earlier, unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period, making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year.     unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. the new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at january 1, 1987.     unilever plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in buoyant response to the results and share split proposal, though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
