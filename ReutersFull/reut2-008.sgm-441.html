	<h3>senate republican leader robert dole said he believed the senate would vote to sustain a presidential veto of an 88 billion dlr highway and mass transit bill.     "i think the veto will be sustained," he told reporters after he and his wife, transportation secretary elizabeth dole, had met with president reagan at the white house.     elizabeth dole said, "we're going to be working on that (sustaining a veto) and...i'm optimistic that we will sustain it."     but she conceded, "it will be tough."     reagan has said he will veto the five-year measure because of objections to so-called highway demonstration projects and transportation programs that put the bill about 10 billion dlr over his budget request.     "he needs to demonstrate that he's in charge and that he's effective and he can't let these big things slip through, saying 'i don't want a confrontation'," sen. dole said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
