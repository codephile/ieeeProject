	<h3>apple computer inc and ast research inc said they are offering two products that allow ms-dos software compatibility with apple's new macintosh se and macintosh ii.     "apple understands the importance of information sharing in multiple vendor environments," said apple chairman john sculley, at a seminar where the new products were released.     the products allow the new macintosh computers to run ms-dos applications in a window at the speed of an ibm pc-xt and ibm pc-at.     the products will require an external ms-dos drive, which apple also announced today.     apple also introduced a host of other products, including storage devices, memory upgrade kits, keyboards and two display monitors.     in addition, it announced jointly with dow jones and co <dj> and mci communications corp <mcic> new electronic mail software, called desktop express, that lets users send graphic documents over telephone wires.  reuter &#3;</h3>
