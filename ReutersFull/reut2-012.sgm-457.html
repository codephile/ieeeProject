	<h3>france has sold between 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes of wheat flour to china, the director general of france's cereal intervention board (onic) bernard vieux said.     he gave no further details of the sale, but added french millers were worried about the unfair competition facing french flour due the lack of end-of-season storage premiums for wheat.     onic raised its estimate of 1986/87 flour exports to 1.70 mln tonnes compared 1.65 mln forecast in march and the 1.87 mln exported in 1985/86.  reuter &#3;</h3>
