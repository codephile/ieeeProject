	<h3>singapore welcomed the london metal exchange's (lme) decision to list singapore as a delivery point for the lme's new dollar-denominated aluminium contract.     tay thiam peng, manager for international trading at the trade development board, said the decision would boost singapore's image as a major delivery port.     "we hope this will encourage more metal traders to set up shop here and that singapore can become a delivery port for other metals as well," he said.     the new contract, to start trading on june 1, is lme's first dollar-contract.  reuter &#3;</h3>
