	<h3>president leon febres cordero said ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for ecuador to meet its commitments.     ecuador said on friday that last week's earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt.     "all legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the president said during a visit to the quake zone. "a government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."     private foreign banks and the world bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for quito to be able to meet its commitments, febres cordero said.     he added that ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.     meanwhile, ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.     presidency minister patricio quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced.     he also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. gasoline supplies would also be limited.  reuter &#3;</h3>
