	<h3>the federal reserve will probably intervene in the government securities market to add reserves today, economists said.     they expected the fed will supply temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements.     fed funds hovered at a relatively high 6-1/4 pct this morning after averaging 6.14 pct on tuesday.     early this afternoon the fed also is expected to supply reserves permanently, effective thursday, by offering to buy all maturities of treasury bills.  reuter &#3;</h3>
