	<h3>interest rates on the london money market were slightly firmer on news u.k. chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the dollar and mark, dealers said.     they said this had come as a surprise and expected the targets, 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, to be promptly tested in the foreign exchange markets. sterling opened 0.3 points lower in trade weighted terms at 71.3.     dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency markets and interest rates.     operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in u.k. base lending rates even less likely in the near term, dealers said.     the feeling remains in the market, however, that fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in u.k. interest rates is not very likely. the market is expected to continue at around these levels, reflecting the current 10 pct base rate level, for some time.     the key three months interbank rate was 1/16 point firmer at 10 9-7/8 pct. &#3;</h3>
