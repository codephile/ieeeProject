	<h3>spanish farmers took their tractors to the roads today and blocked a border crossing with france in a protest against the socialist government's ec policies, officials said.     protestors set cars ablaze and cut off traffic in the rioja wine growing district, while they blocked roads with tractor convoys in other northern regions such as saragossa, where 5,000 farmers joined the demonstrations.     farmers blockaded the border crossing with france at la junquera near barcelona, refusing to allow lorries from other european countries to enter spain.     spanish farmers have been protesting for the past two weeks to demand a better deal within the community. the farm protest came in the wake of demonstrations last night in over 30 cities in which workers marched for wage rises and against job losses.     but the turnout, regarded as a dress rehearsal for a general strike next month, disappointed the communist-led workers commissions union organisers. the ruling socialist party's trade union arm, the general workers' union, did not join in.     more than 20 strikes are planned for this month and next in the transport sector, with stoppages at the state-owned iberia and aviaco airlines and renfe railways.  reuter &#3;</h3>
