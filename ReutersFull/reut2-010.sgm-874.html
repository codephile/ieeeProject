"we held virtually nothing back from reynolds and reynolds because of our confidential relationship and the reputation of the company," michael frank, president of advanced voice, said. "they went from no backround and experience in telecommuncation equipment utilizing voice messaging technology, to their own system a year later, just two months after severing ties with us."  reuter &#3;</h3>
