	<h3>the inter-american development bank said it intended this year to match the over three billion dlrs it lent to latin america in 1986, despite growing pressures on its capital.     in its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, the bank made it clear, however, that the latin countries needed vast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen their ailing economies in the period ahead. the report said latin america continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession that began in the early 1980s, with gross domestic product edging up to nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.     the report said the region's improved economic growth last year was based on a rise in internal demand and fuller utilization previously underused production capacity.     "this situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 and beyond because no significant new investments are being made," the report said.     the bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling 3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to 35.44 billion dlrs.     of last year's loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actually disbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.     to assist in loan activities, the bank said it borrowed 1.91 billion dlrs in the capital markets in 1986, bringing its total outstanding borrowings to 12.11 billion dlrs.     in a briefing for reporters, bank president antonio ortiz-mena said that this year lending by the bank "will be at a similar level to last year."     he noted that bank lending in 1986 was directed particularly to projects in energy, agriculture, and environmental and public health, education and urban development. the annual report was released as the bank's annual meeting is being held in miami.     ortiz-mena told reporters that the bank's member countries will discuss a plan by the united states to reduce the loan veto power from the current majority to 35 pct.     such a plan would allow the united states to block any loan it did not like with the assistance of only one other country.     the proposal, which is tied to any u.s. backing for a new financing for the bank, is sure to run into rough going as the latin countries view it as a move by the reagan administration to control the agency's critical loans.     the u.s. position is that it is not seeking veto power although it believes the bank's largest contributors should have greater influence within the institution.      reuter &#3;</h3>
