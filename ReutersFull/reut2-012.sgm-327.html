	<h3>the national broadcasting co delivered its "final offer" for a new contract to representatives of 2,800 writers, editors and technicians early today and waited for a response.     a committee of the national association of broadcast employees and technicians discussed the offer but after three hours they had not come to any decision.     if the union walks out it would mean simultaneous strikes against all three major u.s. television networks. a different union struck cbs inc <cbs> and capital cities/abc inc <ccb> a month ago. nbc is owned by the general electric co <ge>.     "we're instructing all our members to continue working without a contract," said john krieger, a union official. the contract expired at midnight march 31.     krieger said the committee is empowered to call a strike if it sees fit but he added, "we're not gun shy and we're not strike-happy, we don't take it lightly." he said the union needed time to draft a formal response to the nbc proposal, which the network billed as its "best and final offer."     a spokeswoman for nbc said management personnel were prepared to take assume technical duties if its radio and television facilities are struck.     "if there were a strike, we would not expect any interruption in our service," the nbc spokeswoman said. at cbs and abc, where the writers guild of america has been on strike since early march, viewers have noticed little difference in the programs. however technicians are not involved in the walkout at cbs and abc.     krieger said the "major stumbling block" in the talks with nbc was the network's insistence on having the right to hire engineers and writers on a daily basis. "in a broad sense this would decimate the union," he said, with temporary workers jeopardizing the jobs of staff employees.     nbc said its proposal "contains assurances that there is no intention to replace regular employees with daily hires." nbc said regular employees who may be on layoff would be offered employment first.     nbc also said any daily hires would be represented by the union and would be phased in at four pct of regular staff in the first year of a contract and six percent afterward.     top scale wages would increase to 855 dlrs per week in the first year of the two-year contract and 895 dlrs in the second year, under the nbc proposal. krieger said the network's wage proposals were "disappointing" but not the main issue.     nbc said its proposals would give it greater flexibility in sports and news coverage. it said its proposals would permit limited access to news materials from affiliates and subscription services and allow cable news network to join network pool facilities. cable news network is owned by turner broadcasting system <tbs>.     material from subscription servoces would be limited to an average of about one minute in a half-hour program, nbc said. the network said the changes it seeks "would reduce costly duplication and are vital to nbc's long term health."     the major u.s. networks have experienced cost cutting campaigns following a series of ownership changes that affected the parent companies of all three in the past two years.     laurence tisch became the largest shareholder in cbs, nbc's former parent rca was acquired by general electric and abc was merged into capital cities broadcasting.     the broadcast operations have been hit with layoffs and other belt-tightening measures. network executives cited cable television services and video cassette players which compete for viewers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
