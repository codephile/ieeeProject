	<h3>the chairman of the u.s. house subcommittee on dairy, livestock and poultry issues, rep. charles stenholm (d-tex.), said it is likely the u.s. dairy support price will be cut next year.     "it looks like the price cut may take place," stenholm said at a hearing today on dairy issues.     under the 1985 farm bill, the agriculture secretary can lower the u.s. milk price support to 10.60 dlrs per cwt from the current 11.35 dlrs if government purchases of dairy products are forecast to exceed five billion lbs in 1988.     the u.s. agriculture department forecasts government purchases of dairy products will total six to seven billion lbs in fiscal 1987, but says the level of purchases beyond 1987 will depend on the production decisions of dairy farmers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
