	<h3>west virginia has been declared free of tuberculosis and brucellosis from its cattle population, the u.s. agriculture department said.     it said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no case of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the state-federal cooperative eradication program.     to achieve brucellosis-free status, a state's cattle population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.     there are 33 states, plus the u.s. virgin islands, classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands, which have eradicated brucellosis. only 20 states and the u.s. virgin islands have eradicated both diseases, it noted.  reuter &#3;</h3>
