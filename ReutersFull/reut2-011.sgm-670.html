	<h3>the commodity credit corporation (ccc) switched five mln dlrs in credit guarantees to ecuador to provide for more sales of u.s. vegetable oil, the u.s. agriculture department said.     the credit guarantees were previously earmarked for sales of u.s. cotton, feedgrains and wheat.     the action reduces the guarantee lines previously authorized for sales of cotton from 1.5 mln dlrs to 500,000 dlrs, for feedgrains from four mln to two mln and for wheat from 45 mln dlrs to 43 mln dlrs and increases coverage for vegetable oil sales from two mln to seven mln dlrs, the department said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
