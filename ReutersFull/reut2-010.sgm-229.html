	<h3>the soviet economy has grown at an increased rate under mikhail gorbachev's leadership, but his goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from u.s. intelligence agencies.     the report was prepared jointly by the central intelligence agency and the defense intelligence agency for the congressional joint economic committee, which released it.     it said the soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986, gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of growth over the previous 10 years.     gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and modernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some of the gains, the report said.     "although many of the specific policies gorbachev has adopted are not new, the intensity gorbachev has brought to his efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors lacked. nonetheless, gorbachev's program appears too ambitious on a number of counts," the report said.     earlier this week, two u.s. experts on the soviet union said gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years if he continues his reform policies.     "i don't think he can last four years," marshall goldman of harvard university told a congressional hearing. "he's moving so fast, he's stepping on so many toes."     a similar comment came from peter reddaway of the smithsonian institution's kennan institute for advanced russian studies.     the economic report said meeting targets for commodity output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to install more advanced equipment.     none of gorbachev's proposals would change the system of economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and technological change, the report added.     "the first significant resistance to specific policies, although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality standards and output targets simultaneously," the report said.     the cia-dia report predicted two to three pct growth in the soviet economy over the next several years. it said the soviet union trailed the u.s. by seven to 12 years in advanced manufacturing technologies, such as computers and microprocessors.  reuter &#3;</h3>
