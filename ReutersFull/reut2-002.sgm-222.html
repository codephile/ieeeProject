	<h3>world grain trade could be turning the corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season, a cargill, inc. analyst said.     writing in the march issue of the cargill bulletin, david rogers of cargill's commodity marketing division cited a gradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slow rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows.     he said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced in many nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade and could lead to more activity in other grain markets.     rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest level in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand has begun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their expensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres.  reuter &#3;</h3>
