	<h3>brazil's 14-bank advisory committee expressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator antonio padua de seixas over the country's suspension of interest payments, according to a telex from committee chairman citibank to creditor banks worldwide.     bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger and frustration on the committee over brazil's unilateral move last friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines.     seixas, director of the brazilian central bank's foreign debt department, met the full panel on tuesday and wednesday.     seixas, who met again this morning with senior citibank executive william rhodes and representatives from committee vice-chairmen morgan guaranty trust co and lloyds bank plc, told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.     the telex could be sent to creditors as early as today, bankers said.     despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans for brazilian finance minister dilson funaro to meet commercial bankers during his trip to washington on friday and saturday.     funaro will be explaining brazil's actions to u.s. treasury secretary james baker, federal reserve board chairman paul volcker and international monetary fund managing director michel camdessus before travelling to europe at the weekend.     meanwhile, bankers were to hear in new york this afternoon what impact brazil's hard line would have on argentina, with an initial presentation from argentine treasury secretary mario brodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement. argentina has threatened to emulate brazil's payments moratorium if the banks do not grant its request.  reuter &#3;</h3>
