	<h3>west germany's capital market liberalization program has stalled and bankers are worried it may take years for further reforms to be completed.     liberalization got underway in may 1985 when foreign banks received bundesbank permission to lead-manage mark eurobonds.     further moves included introduction of mark-denominated certificates of deposit last year. but other changes, including revisions in the domestic options market and introduction of futures contracts, need lengthy statutory changes and this may take years, bankers and dealers say.     deutsche bank ag co-chairman f. wilhelm christians called last week for an enlargement of current capital market instruments to include instruments already standard abroad.     he said these are needed especially when prices fall, citing declines in west german share prices in the first two months of this year when stock indices fell about 20 pct.     others are more blunt. securities dealers say the lack of viable hedging instruments for shares and bonds makes trading in domestic markets too risky.     "we need a stock index futures contract, and a futures contract for recent government bonds," one dealer said.     west germany now has options contracts on about five pct of shares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about 30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.     options can only be written on the original 14 bonds selected when bond options were introduced last april. the most recent bond on the list was issued in 1985.     there are no futures exchanges in west germany. german banks may participate in futures exchanges through branches abroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringent west german rules requiring that every contract be secured on a one-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.     another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existing markets, owing to lack of private investor participation.     private individuals and corporations do not engage in options trading now due to west germany's civil and exchange laws, which define losses made in futures and options business as gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.     options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity from pension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in these instruments. but they are to be allowed to enter the business soon as the european community begins to harmonize rules governing funds.     manfred laux, general secretary of the west german mutual funds association in frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to be adopted by october 1, 1989 at the latest.     the push to adopt new instruments has not been great in the past, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, which gives them a bad name in west germany. but pressure for their introduction here is growing.     the start-up of a swiss futures exchange has some bankers considering if a similar exchange would be useful in west germany. they say that without innovations, some business could drift to london, which the bundesbank vehemently opposes.     an official at the london international financial futures exchange (liffe) said the exchange currently has no plans to introduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existing mark-dollar contract. but he said the exchange is studying the feasibility of other contracts, including one for three-month mark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.     a bundesbank capital markets expert said the bundesbank has no objections to hedging through futures but any liberalization in that sector is still in the early planning stages after earlier talks ended two years ago.     considerations about the futures business have been drawn out because of the large number of participants involved in talks. they include parliament, the bundesbank, the federal banking supervisory board, eight west german stock exchanges and their governing states, and the four west german banking associations.     beyond options and futures, other changes being suggested include replacing the federal government's current bond consortium with an auction procedure similar to one being considered in the u.k. and already in practice in the u.s.     this would upset the existing market order providing german and foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but it would eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presently arise within the fixed consortium quota system.     in addition, some bankers would like the method of bond trading on the west german stock exchange changed to a system of continuous price-setting from the current system in which every bond price is fixed once a day.     this would make trading more transparent if it reduced the proportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pct of the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say.  reuter &#3;</h3>
