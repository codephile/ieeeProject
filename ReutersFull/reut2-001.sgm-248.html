	<h3>the federal savings and loan insurance corp is facing a deficit because of its potential liability from insolvent savings associations, the general accounting office told a house banking hearing.     "we have preliminarily determined that fslic needs to  establish a contingent liability in the range of eight billion dlrs to handle cases that will require action in the near future," frederick wolf of the gao said.     "when that amount is deducted from fslic's reserves, fslic would have a deficit of over three billion dlrs as of the end of 1986. clearly, fslic needs additional funds to resolve the large backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associations that continue to operate," wolf said.     he urged the committee to support the treasury department's plan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalize fslic.     wolf said as of septmember, 1986, about 85 pct of fslic insured savings associations were solvent, while 15 pct were insolvent.     he said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable, earning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first three quarters of the year, while the other 20 pct of associations lost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period.     the gao is the investigating agency of congress.     roy green, president of the federal home loan bank of dallas, estimated his district would need five billion to eight billion dlrs over the next five years to close 12 texas savings associations and 14 associations in nearby states which he said are considered "hopelessly insolvent".  reuter &#3;</h3>
