	<h3>european community agriculture ministers agreed to extend the 1986/87 milk and beef marketing years to the end of may, belgian minister paul de keersmaeker told a news conference.     he said the reason for the two-month extension of the only ec farm product marketing years which end during the spring months was that it would be impossible for ministers formally to agree 1987/88 farm price arrangements before may 12.     this is when the european parliament is due to deliver its opinion on price proposals from the ec commission.  reuter &#3;</h3>
