	<h3>marine midland banks inc said in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that it may reclassify as "nonperforming" 359 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to brazil.     the company added that it expects first quarter 1987 earnings to be "down moderately" from year-earlier levels.     "continued suspension of interest payments on the medium- and long-term debt could result in such loans being classified as nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual," it said.     however, it added its belief that it was "premature to decide at this time" whether to reclassify the loans.     brazil announced feb. 20 that it was temporarily suspending interest payments on all its medium- and long-term foreign bank debt.     marine midland said its total brazil outstandings as of the end of 1986 were 653 mln dlrs, including 359 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term loans and 294 mln dlrs of short-term outstandings.     as of dec. 31, it had interest receivable of about five mln dlrs on its medium- and long-term brazil outstandings.     if debt restructuring talks between brazil and its creditor banks are not completed by the end of the third quarter, the company estimated brazil's action would reduce its net income for the year by about 22 mln dlrs.     in the first quarter of 1986, marine midland reported  record earnings of 38.2 mln dlrs, bolstered by certain non-recurring securities gains.     it said it expected lower first quarter 1987 earnings because the money market cost of funds had increased, "narrowing net interest spreads somewhat." it said the earnings projection was based on "preliminary" 1987 data.  reuter &#3;</h3>
