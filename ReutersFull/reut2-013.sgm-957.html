	<h3>this week's group of seven (g-7) meeting in washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached at the tokyo summit last may to include italy and canada in group of five (g-5) talks on management of the international monetary system and related issues, the italian treasury said.     it said in a statement the g-7 meeting, which italy plans to attend, will provide a forum for considering the tokyo accord in the light of events in paris in february this year.     on february 22, italy boycotted a meeting in paris of its g-7 partners - the united states, japan, west germany, france, britain and canada - after being excluded from an earlier session of talks involving g-5 members.     today's statement from the italian treasury said-     "nobody denies the existence of g-5 but we should like it to be remembered that the tokyo accords provided for the enlargement of the group to italy and canada whenever "the management or the improvement of the international monetary economic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.'"     italy refused to attend the paris g-7 meeting on the grounds that g-5, grouping the united states, japan, west germany, france and britain, had reduced italy's role to rubber stamping agreements already taken.     the italian treasury said today that italy was "certain that this time incidents would not occur."     but it said it would be opportune to look in depth at the role and the procedures of g-7 in relation to those of g-5.  reuter &#3;</h3>
