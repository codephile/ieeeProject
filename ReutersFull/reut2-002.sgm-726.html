	<h3>u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng said he is "very disappointed" by a canadian government finding that u.s. corn has injured ontario corn growers.     "this action is not helpful in the context of the ongoing u.s.-canada free trade talks or in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations," lyng said in a statement.     the canadian government today said ottawa would continue to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on u.s. corn imports.     lyng said the u.s. made a case that u.s. corn imports are not the cause of any problem of canadian corn producers, adding that u.s. corn exports to canada are declining.     "apparently they (canada) have ignored the fact that canadian corn and other coarse grain production is rising faster than consumption," lyng said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
