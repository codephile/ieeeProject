	<h3>reynolds metals co said it plans to restart the last idle potline at its troutdale, ore., primary aluminum plant.     with the restart of this 22,700 tonne a year production line, reynolds said it will be operating at 100 pct of its consolidated primary aluminum capacity of 695,000 tonnes per year.     reynolds said work on the restart will begin in the near future and it is expected that actual metal production will begin september 1.     the company said the start-up was necessitated by continuing strong demand for aluminum and dwindling worldwide inventories, and that the metal is needed to supply reynolds' various fabricating businesses.  reuter &#3;</h3>
