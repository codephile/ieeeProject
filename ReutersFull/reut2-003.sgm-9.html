	<h3>the treasury department said it would temporarily permit imports of south african uranium ore and oxide pending clarification of anti-apartheid sanctions laws passed by congress last fall.     the decision was announced late friday. it applies, until july 1, to uranium ore and oxide imported into the u.s. for processing and re-export to third countries.     the treasury said it took the action because it felt that when congress passed the comprehensive south african sanctions bill last fall over president reagan's veto it had not intended to hurt u.s. industry.     in addition, the treasury said it would permit u.s.-made goods to be imported temporarily from south african state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing.      reuter &#3;</h3>
