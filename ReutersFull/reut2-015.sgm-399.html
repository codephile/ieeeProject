	<h3>the leaders of two of japan's top business groups said in separate statements the group of seven (g-7) accord reached in washington yesterday is of deep concern to japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the yen's current level as appropriate.     eishiro saito, chairman of the federation of economic organizations (keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well above adequate levels. he did not elaborate.     takashi ishihara, chairman of the japan committee for economic development, said the accord will not prevent the yen from rising further.     "we do not understand why the g-7 approved present rates as the yen has risen excessively since the paris accord," ishihara said.     g-7 members britain, canada, france, italy, japan, the u.s. and west germany said in a statement they consider their currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.     saito called on each g-7 member nation to prepare to intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.  reuter &#3;</h3>
