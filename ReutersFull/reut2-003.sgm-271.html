	<h3>italy has shown interest in british new crop wheat recently but the actual volume booked so far by italian buyers has not been large, traders said.     they put purchases at around 50,000 tonnes for sept/dec shipments but said some of the business was transacted at the start of the year.     italian interior home markets have been active in recent weeks and traders said around 200,000 tonnes have traded between dealers and home consumers. some of this has been covered in the market here and more possibly will be, traders said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
