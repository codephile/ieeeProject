	<h3>the world bank said it approved a 70 mln dlr loan to hungary to help finance a 833.1 mln dlr telecommunications project.     the bank noted that hungary, which until recently had given telecommunications low priority, recognized that inadequate telecommunications are a serious constraint to economic development and reform.     the project extends through 1991 and will help magyar posta, the state enterprise overseeing the telecommunications sector, meet its long-term development goals.  reuter &#3;</h3>
