	<h3>the president of the export-import bank said the bank was changing its lending policies to reflect changing conditions in export financing.     president john bohn told a house appropriations subcommittee hearing commercial banks have largely withdrawn from financing exports and export projects were becoming smaller.     "exporters now need financing in riskier markets and on deals which are smaller, take longer to put together and close," bohn said in his testimony. "lenders, however, want less risk, higher profit, transaction-oriented and less labor-intensive activities.     "it became clear to us the eximbank must assume a broader range of explicitly defined country and transaction risks than it has previously. programs and procedures need to be simplified, streamlined and internally consistent," he said.     bohn said the bank would focus on the needs of the middle market product or service exporter and would have essentially one loan program and one guarantee program for both medium-term and long-term export transactions.     "both programs will provide up to 85 pct financing, the maximum permitted under the oecd consensus. eximbank loans will carry the minimum interest rate allowed by the oecd rate schedule for the market and the term," he said.     bohn said the bank was requesting a limitation of 1 billion dlrs for regular loan obligations, of which up to 200 mln dlrs may be available as tied aid credits, and a limitation of 10 billion dlrs for guarantee and insurance commitments.     he said the bank would have to come back to congress later this year to discuss its capitalization needs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
