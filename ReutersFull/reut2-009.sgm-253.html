	<h3>china should tighten imports of ordinary goods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be made domestically, premier zhao ziyang said.     he told the national people's congress, china's parliament, that the country's foreign exchange is limited and must be used where it is most needed. "we should expand production of import substitutes and increase their proportion," he said. on exports, china should increase its proportion of manufactured goods, especially textiles, light industrial goods, electronics and machinery, he said.     zhao said china should lower the cost of exports and control the export of goods that incur too much loss.     zhao said china should work to provide a more favourable investment environment for foreign businessmen.  reuter &#3;</h3>
