	<h3>alabama has advanced from a class b to a class a rating in the eradication of cattle brucellosis program, thus relieving some restrictions in the interstate movement of cattle from the state, the u.s. agriculture department said.     to qualify for a class a rating, a state must keep its herd infection rate at or below 0.25 pct for 12 months.     the change in alabama's classification reduces the testing and identification requirements for cattle moved interstate for breeding purposes, to immediate slaughter or to quarantined feedlots, usda said.     brucellosis is an infectious bacterial disease that causes abortion, reduced fertility and lower milk yields in cattle, it noted.  reuter &#3;</h3>
