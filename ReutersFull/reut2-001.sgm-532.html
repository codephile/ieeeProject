	<h3>thomas berger, deputy assistant secretary of the treasury, said that a further drop in the exchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up and trigger inflation.     he told a meeting of the president's export council that the japanese and the germans have cut their profit margins to reflect recent drops in the dollar, so prices have remained much the same.     but he added that if the dollar dropped further there could be inflation in the united states.     berger also said that a further devalued dollar may cause economic depressions in some u.s. trading partners, and that would not be in america's interest because it would close those markets to u.s. goods.  reuter &#3;</h3>
