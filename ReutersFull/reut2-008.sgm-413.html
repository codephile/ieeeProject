	<h3>texaco inc said it has filed a motion with the texas court of appeals to supplement the court record with new evidence it has just received of alleged bias by judge anthony j.p. farris against texaco and its chief trial lawyer in its litigation with pennzoil co <pzl>.     the company contended that the alleged bias provides clear grounds for a new trial. it said the motion was filed in connection with its appeal of the pennzoil judgment pending in that court.     texaco said the motion introduces two letters written by farris, who has since died, to two houston lawyers in late 1984, after he had been assigned the case but before the trial began.     the company alleged that farris harbored personal animosity against texaco and its chief trial lawyer, richard b. miller, due to an earlier motion to have farris disqualified from the case. the motion was filed due to farris' acceptance of a 10,000 dlr campaign contribution from pennzoil's chief trial lawyer, joseph p. jamail, shortly after the case was assigned to him, texaco said.     in february the texas appellate court refused to grant texaco a new trial, finding no evidence that farris was biased.     texaco said it is preparing its application for a rehearing on the merits of its case before the texas appelate court, and the application will be filed on march 30.     the company said it will ask the court to reconsider its decision on the issue of due process in light of the farris letters.     in the suit, pennzoil has been awarded about 10.53 billion dlrs in damages from texaco in connection with pennzoil's proposed merger with getty oil co, which was later taken over by texaco. texaco is appealing the ruling.     a texaco spokeswoman said the company had known of the letters for some time but were unable to release them until now due to understandings of confidentiality with the attorneys from which they were secured.  reuter &#3;</h3>
