	<h3>avions marcel dassault-breguet aviation <avmd.pa> has offered the french defence ministry a new design of its rafale fighter which is lighter and less detectible by radar, a company spokesman said today.     the new version would weigh between 8.5 and nine tonnes unarmed against 9.5 tonnes for the existing rafale-a demonstrator which first flew last year, he said.     the rafale-d design calls for special paints and materials to absorb radar signals, as well as smoother contours and electronic counter-measures.  reuter &#3;</h3>
