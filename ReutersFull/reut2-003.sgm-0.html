	<h3>the bank of england said it forecast a shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.     among the factors affecting liquidity, it said bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain around 1.02 billion stg while below target bankers' balances would take out a further 140 mln.     against this, a fall in the note circulation would add 345 mln stg and the net effect of exchequer transactions would be an inflow of some 545 mln stg, the bank added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
