	<h3>abbey national, the second largest building society in the u.k., said it has arranged a one billion dlr euro-certificate of deposit program.     it said this is the largest such program to date for a building society and the first to be denominated in u.s. dollars.     citicorp investment bank ltd is lead manager and arranger for the program and will act as a dealer, along with shearson lehman brothers international, swiss bank corp international ltd and s.g. warburg and co ltd.     abbey national has been very active in the international capital markets ever since building societies were permitted by law to tap the wholesale markets.     the building society's general manager, finance, james tyrrell, said in a statement the program is part of abbey's strategy of spreading its funding option from what has recently been medium/long term into shorter term instruments.     he said this also widens abbey's investor base.  reuter &#3;</h3>
