	<h3>swissair <swsz.z> said that the order for mcdonnell douglas corp <md> md-11 long haul jets confirmed this morning was worth a total 1.2 billion swiss francs.     president robert staubli told a news conference it had not yet been decided whether the planes would have general electric co <ge.n>, pratt and whitney <utx> or rolls royce engines.     the airline said it chose the u.s. plane rather than the rival a-340 of the european airbus consortium because it met better the swissair requirements and would be able to enter service in 1990 giving a smooth transition from the dc-10s it replaces.     staubli said swissair planned to have replaced its whole fleet of 11 dc10s by 1992 at the latest, entailing the order of five more long-haul planes in addition to the six announced today. he said it would decide on the basis of the development of traffic whether these five would be md-11s or boeing 747s.     however, staubli ruled out the possibility that swissair might eventually choose a-340s. "we cannot afford to operate three different types of aircraft," he said.     swissair also had no short term plans to exercise its option to buy airbus a-310s, of which it already operates nine, officials said. but it would still hold the options open.     staubli declined to say how much it paid for each of the md-11s. the total 1.2 billion franc figure was not only for the planes but also for spare parts and other related expenditure.     company officials said that swissair intended to cover around 75 pct of the costs of its entire dc-10 replacement programme with internally generated funds. it hopes to raise the remaining 25 pct on the swiss and other capital markets through issuing straight or equity related bonds and/or through a capital increase.     the first such bond issue would likely come this year, they predicted.  reuter &#3;</h3>
