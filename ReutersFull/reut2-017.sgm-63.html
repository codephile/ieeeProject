	<h3>the bundesbank intervened in the open market to buy dollars for yen ahead of the frankfurt fixing, dealers said.     they said the bundesbank bought dollars for around 139.80 yen in small amounts in the half-hour running up to the 1100 gmt fix.     the bundesbank did not intervene when the dollar was fixed in frankfurt at 1.7969 marks.     earlier the bank of japan bought dollars steadily in the far east, but could not stop heavy selling which pushed the dollar to a post-war low of 139.05 yen at one point.  reuter &#3;</h3>
