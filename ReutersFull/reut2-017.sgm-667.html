	<h3>west germany said it would accept a superpower plan to ban medium and shorter-range nuclear missiles in europe provided bonn was allowed to retain its own shorter-range missiles.     after six weeks of public wrangling over the so-called "double-zero" offer, chancellor helmut kohl's coalition finally said it would agree to an east-west ban on shorter-range nuclear missiles.     but in a statement issued after top-level talks, the government said bonn wanted the 72 west german pershing-1a missiles excluded from an east-west accord -- a demand diplomats said could produce a snag in the geneva arms talks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
