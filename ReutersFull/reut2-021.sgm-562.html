	<h3>iranian president ali khamenei said he doubted the u.s. was in position to take violent action against iran in the gulf, tehran radio reported.     the u.s. government "is in a very difficult situation now and it is not clear if it has the necessary elements for a violent action," the radio quoted him as saying in an interview with the english language daily tehran times.     in washington, president ronald reagan said he had decided on a response to iran, which the americans blame for two missile attacks on u.s.-related tankers in kuwaiti waters last week, but declined to say what the response was.     khamenei said the u.s. government had to take some action to demonstrate its authority, "but on the other hand any violent act in the persian gulf will greatly harm long-term u.s. interests," the radio, monitored in nicosia, reported.     on efforts for a ceasefire in the iran-iraq war, khamenei said: "declaration of the aggressor and a ceasefire should be concurrent. formation of a panel to determine the aggressor necessarily preceeds the ceasefire."     he also rejected a peace-keeping committee or a buffer force as instruments to implement a july 20 u.n. security council order for a ceasefire in the seven-year-old gulf war.  reuter &#3;</h3>
