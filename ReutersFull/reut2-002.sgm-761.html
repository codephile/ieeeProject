	<h3>the pioneer group inc said its 70 pct-owned teberebie goldfields ltd venture has been granted an additional concession of land in ghana to look for and mine gold.     the state gold mining corp of ghana granted the venture an additional 14.5 square kilometers in teberebie, ghana, contiguous to 11.5 square kilometers granted earlier, the company said.     the original concession appears to have a substantial amount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams, or 6/100 ounces, of gold per metric ton.     but the venture has no firm estimates on the costs of extracting the gold and no assurances can be given that the reserves can be mined profitably, the company said.     it said teberebie goldfields has not conducted tests on the newly granted land but added the land seems to be similar in geological characteristics to the original land.  reuter &#3;</h3>
