	<h3>three japanese credit rating agencies are entering into fierce competition with <moody's japan k.k.> and <standard and poor's asia inc>, the local branches of the two u.s. giants, as the japanese credit market opens up to foreigners, japanese rating agency managers said.     standard and poor's recent triple-a rating of <chiyoda fire and marine insurance co ltd's> claims-paying ability caused the japanese agencies, which had rated chiyoda's convertible bond only a-plus, to come under some criticism for being too conservative, they said.     chiyoda is japan's eighth largest non-life insurer.     standard and poor's corp has been in the business for more than a century while <moody's investors service inc> was founded more than 80 years ago. each has rated some 20,000 to 30,000 u.s. and about 100 japanese issues.     with japanese insurers eager to issue more bonds through overseas financing companies, chiyoda's rating will stimulate their interest in using the u.s. agencies, the analysts said.     standard and poor's said chiyoda's rating was based on its strong capitalisation, stable performance and high levels of unrealised appreciation, particularly in its stock portfolio.     the u.s. agency also emphasised the favourable regulatory environment in which japan's non-life insurers operate.     japanese agencies were shocked by the earlier aaa ratings on the claims-paying ability of <sumitomo life insurance co> and <dai-ichi mutual life insurance co> by standard and poor's, the first ratings given to japanese life insurers.     strong japanese insurers can accumulate cash to ward off shocks from any foreign investment, standard and poor's said.     a month ago <nippon investors service inc> (nis) assigned an aaa rating to <financial securities assurance inc>, a u.s. firm that gives financial guarantees on corporate securities.      "nis has assigned rates on a u.s. firm for the first time in japan, which was the first step into the u.s. rating market," kazuya kumura, general manager of nis, said.     kyosuke yoshida, managing director of japan bond research institute (jbri), said, "agencies should be more actively used to respond better to growing overseas investor interest."     takeshi watanabe, president of japan credit rating agency ltd (jcra), said, "(our) advantages are that we have a deeper understanding of business practices in japan, other asian nations and japanese investor behaviour and are also more alert and quick to react to domestic news."      jbri, with 12 years' experience, is japan's largest agency. the other two have been in business for two years.     finance ministry approval of yen commercial paper issues by japanese residents, which is expected soon, will stimulate local agencies to grow quickly, securities analysts said.     the finance ministry is encouraging more use of agencies by gradually abolishing limits on corporate debt creation.     in december it allowed non-residents holding at least an a-rating from one of the agencies to issue samurai, shogun and euroyen bonds without first meeting the normal stringent financial criteria.      but local companies, regardless of the rating obtained for a planned bond, must meet the tough financial criteria set by commissioned banks and underwriters, which includes minimum net asset requirements and capitalisation, local agency managers said.     commissioned banks are responsible for protecting bondholders and conducting principal and coupon payments.     investors' risk in corporate default has been checked by the very system that is slowing the smooth growth of japanese credit rating agencies, the managers said.      "the idea of rating in japan has been woven into prerequisites for an issuer company to satisfy financial criteria," jcra's watanabe said.     the finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in january to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight bonds.     "an internationally comprehensive market system is needed to lure more overseas investors into the japanese market," jbri's yoshida said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
