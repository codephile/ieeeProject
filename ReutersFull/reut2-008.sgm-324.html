	<h3>argentina expects to reach agreement with its commercial bank creditors in the near future on a new financing package including 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans, treasury secretary mario brodersohn said.     addressing argentine businessman during the inter-american development bank (iadb) meeting here, he said the two sides will meet again next thursday in new york.     "we have made significant progress over the last 30 days and we should have an agreement in a shorter lapse of time than managed by mexico, venezuela or chile," he said.     brodersohn reiterated that argentina's goal is to reach an agreement which permits four pct growth this year, following last year's 5.5 pct and negative growth in 1985.     he said discussions were still continuing on debt-capitalization plans and schemes for on-lending, in the light of certain argentine concerns.     the government is anxious that debt that is capitalized should represent new investment in the country on a dollar invested per dollar capitalized basis, rather than a simple transfer of ownership of the debt, he said.     at the same time, it wants to avoid an expansionary monetary impact from on-lending schemes, whereby debt repayments are recycled by banks into new loans.     brodersohn said also agreement was close on the proposal for so-called exit bonds, whereby creditors can sell out their debt.     argentina's 1987 financing needs come to 3.53 billion dlrs, including the 2.15 billion from banks and a 1.38 billion dlr imf loan already agreed. it is projecting a current account deficit of 2.2 billion dlrs after one of 2.4 billion last year.     it estimates export earnings will have dropped by 7.1 billion dlrs between 1985-87 as a result of falling commodity prices.     argentina, owing 50 billion dlrs, is latin america's fourth biggest debtor.  reuter &#3;</h3>
