	<h3>the financial institutions subcommittee of the house banking committee postponed indefinitely a session to draft legislation on the federal savings and loan insurance corp, fslic.     the mark-up session was postponed after democrats on the subcommittee failed in a caucus to agree on several issues, including the size of a financial rescue package for fslic, a committee staff member said.     on tuesday, the senate banking committee passed a bill to recapitalize fslic at 7.5 billion dlrs over two years.  reuter &#3;</h3>
