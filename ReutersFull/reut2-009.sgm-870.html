	<h3>the bank of france intervened on the market to buy dollars and sell yen to support the u.s. currency, dealers said.     a major french bank said it acted for the central bank in buying between five and 15 mln dlrs against yen.     a dealer at another bank said his bank had been asked to publicise the intervention, to send a clear signal to the markets that central banks were acting in concert to maintain the exchange rates agreed to be appropriate at last month's meeting of the group of five and canada in paris.     the dollar was being quoted at 6.0950/70 francs in early afternoon dealings after a fix of 6.09425 francs.     the major french bank said it sold yen at a rate of 149.28 against the dollar.     the u.s. currency was subsequently being quoted at 149.25/35.     the bank of japan was reported in the market overnight to bolster the credibility of the paris accord following several days of pressure against the dollar.     pressure developed after u.s. treasury secretary james baker repeated earlier statements that the reagan administration had no targets for the dollar, apparently undermining the assumption that the agreement in paris had fixed broad fluctuation ranges for major currencies.     baker later said his remark had been misinterpreted.  reuter &#3;</h3>
