	<h3>vulcan corp's first quarter operating results will show a loss, chairman lloyd i. miller told told the annual meeting.     the company reported a profit of 365,883 dlrs, 23 cts a share, for the first quarter last year with one cent a share coming from non-operating factors, a spokesman said.     miller attributed the expected loss to completion of the purchase transfer and consolidation of operating assets of the o'sullivan rubber division, saying this was proving more costly and taking more time than originally anticipated.     vulcan is working to resolve the problems, miller told shareholders, adding it appears it will take most of 1987 to find solutions.      reuter &#3;</h3>
