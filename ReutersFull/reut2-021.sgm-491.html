	<h3>u.s. television networks said on monday that u.s. forces launched a retaliatory strike against iran late sunday, apparently attacking two iranian offshore oil drilling platforms.     nbc news said it understood six iranians had been pulled from the sea.     it said cautiously that u.s. forces attacked late sunday and that two iranian oil platforms east of bahrain were ablaze as a result, but cbs news and other networks said flatly that u.s. forces attacked the iranian oil platforms.     u.s. officials had been meeting on a response since friday when an attack on a kuwaiti port severely damaged a u.s.-flagged ship.     president reagan said on sunday he had already made a decision on the u.s. response to friday's iran attack but would not say what the decision was.     defense secretary caspar weinberger said on saturday the attack on a u.s.-flagged ship in kuwaiti waters on friday was almost certainly by an iran silkworm missile.  reuter &#3;</h3>
