	<h3>vestron inc said it is seeking an order in california superior court for los angeles county to restrain hemdale film corp and its hemdale video corp affiliate from distributing or relasing the films "platoon" and "hoosiers" in all ancillary markets.     the company said its suit seeks to order hemdale to live up to commitments under its exclusive home video distributrion agreements with vestron for the films and seeks damages for lost profits as well.     vestron said the suit alleges that hemdale was to deliver each film to vestron within 30 days after theatrical release.     the company alleged hemdale has refused to deliver the films in an attempt to renegotiate the agreements with vestron.     it said the dispute appears to make a significant delay of the videocassette release of platoon inevitable.  reuter &#3;</h3>
