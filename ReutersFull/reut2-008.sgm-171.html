	<h3>french 1987 growth will probably be about two pct, the same as last year, due to an international environment that is less favourable than expected, finance minister edouard balladur was quoted as saying.     treasury director daniel lebegue said last month that gross domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct this year, against an original target of 2.8 pct.     although in line with the latest organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) estimate of 2.1 pct growth, the forecast will be balanced by growth in investments and exports, balladur said in an interview with the daily les echos.     last month balladur said french gdp had grown by just two pct last year, compared with an initial 1986 target of 2.5 pct and 1.1 pct growth in 1985.     he told les echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficit to 115 billion francs from this year's figure of 129 billion and compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985.     he has already announced his intention of cutting the deficit to 100 billion francs in 1989.  reuter &#3;</h3>
