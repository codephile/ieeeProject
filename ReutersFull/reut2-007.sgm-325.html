	<h3>a statement yesterday by secretary of state george shultz after he met with wheat growers that u.s. agricultural products must be competitively priced was significant in that he recognized the importance of the soviet market and the need for u.s. prices to be at world market levels, u.s. grain trade industry officials said.     they said that shultz's comments, while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the ussr, were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action.     in response to a query on what the state department's position is on selling subsidized wheat to moscow, shultz told the leaders of the national association of wheat growers that prices must be competitive if the u.s. is going to trade.     the soviet union, the world's largest grain importer, has bought no u.s. wheat for more than a year, complaining the price was far above world market levels. a u.s. offer last fall to sell the soviets lower-priced wheat through the export enhancement program, eep, was also rebuffed due to the price.     shultz was said to be adamantly against the u.s. wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the soviet union, grain industry sources said.     intense speculation the u.s. might make a fresh eep wheat offer to the soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions. kansas city hard wheat futures rose another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel, while cbt march wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.     "i'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the soviet union," said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.     "we have to be competitive. it's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else," shultz told the farm leaders. "that is our approach in negotiations with the soviets," he said.     if those comments do signal that the state department is no longer opposed to the u.s. selling wheat to the ussr under eep, it certainly improves the chances for an eep wheat offer to moscow, an industry lobbyst said.     national wheat grower's officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary's comments.     "his comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our judgment promise any immediate action on eep," an official with the wheat group said.     the wheat growers official noted, however, that "there is significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of eep wheat to the soviets."     in a meeting with exporters this week, secretary of agriculture richard lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to moscow, the officials said.     an aide to usda undersecretary daniel amstutz, who is reported to be strongly opposed to eep wheat to the soviets, said that the shultz comments "are consistent with what he (shultz) has taught for years as an economist," but said they don't necessarily relate to the soviet union.     amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to lyng said lyng would not comment on shultz's statements.     but trade sources were hopeful that the shultz comments may indicate some movement towards eep wheat to moscow.     "if he didn't say no, then there's a chance. this is potentially a positive development," a commodity source said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
