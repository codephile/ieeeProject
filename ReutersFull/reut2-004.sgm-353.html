	<h3>eurobond prices in the floating rate note sector slumped across the board by as much as a full point on some issues.     "today has been irrational, irresponsible -- possibly the worst day in what has been a dire six months for the floater market," commented a senior frn trader at a u.k. bank.     republic of ireland frns were marked sharply down in initial trading and market nerves soon infected other supra-national and sovereign paper with dealers attributing the falls to aggressive professional shorting by a few leading u.s. investment houses.     the frn market has been suffering from acute contraction of liquidity and consequent drain of investor confidence since the effective collapse in the market for perpetual floating rate issues late last year.     since then, frn specialists noted that retail interest has been sparse or completely absent and the stagnant market for floating rate paper has become increasingly vulnerable to manipulation, with nerves affecting all variety of borrowers.     floating rate debt of u.s. and canadian banks came under pressure last month when fears resurfaced about their exposure to latin american debt. canadian banks were hard hit today.     fears about the irish economy, exacerbated by recent post-electoral political wrangling in dublin, prompted a sell-off of ireland paper this morning with both dollar and mark-denominated irish issues tumbling by a full point or more.     however, frn dealers polled by reuters felt the irish issues had been singled out -- as the u.s. and canadian banks were most recently -- as the market's most vulnerable sector.     "a handful of professional houses are targetting the weak paper, shorting it aggressively and this is just starting the domino effect with basically sound paper also starting to roll with it," a senior frn market source explained.     although floating paper from better-regarded borrowers such as the u.k. managed to finish the day only around 10 basis points down, other sovereigns like sweden and supranationals like eurofima suffered heavier losses, frn dealers said.     debt exposure fears continued to undermine u.s. and canadian bank paper with one u.k. house citing a fall of 1-5/8 point on the day on a royal bank of canada issue.     frn traders noted japanese investors, initially enthusiastic floating rate debt buyers, had lost confidence in the market and speculated that a crisis meeting, such as the one called upon the collapse of the perpetuals, could be imminent.     "retail clients just don't want to know about the floaters any more so it has degenerated to a wily pass-the-parcel among the professionals, all scheming to sweep the paper under the carpet," another senior frn trader said.     "i don't know what is going to happen to the market. it can't go on like this," he added.     in the fixed-rate sector, trading was dull with the market still attempting to digest a heavy volume of new issues from earlier this week although primary market activity slowed somewhat today, trading and syndicate sources reported.     dollar straight bonds ended the day barely changed from opening levels as investors failed to react on the unexpectedly large 4.1 pct rise in u.s. february retail sales, prefering to wait for tomorrow's producer price and business inventory data.     a 100 mln dlr deal for norsk hydro was launched later in the day and the issue was trading around its total two pct fees at close of grey market trade although dealers said the borrower's frequent appearance in the euromarkets could deter investors.     the canadian dollar sector however saw good two-way trade and a continuation of recent healthy volume as the canadian dollar rides high on the foreign exchanges and futures markets.     dealers said the strength of the canadian dollar, which has firmed especially over the last two days, has renewed end investors confidence in the currency.     a new canadian dollar issue for hydro quebec was seeing excellent demand, sector specialists said, and the issue was quickly increased to a total of 150 mln dlrs from 125 mln.     "this kind of paper can be hard to sell and it is gratifying to see such a high level of interest, both european and domestic canadian demand," commented one trader at a canadian house.     eurosterling, which has been in the limelight lately, also on foreign exchange and currency bullishness, slipped slightly.     senior eurosterling sources noted that bond prices fell back today, more or less in line with losses seen on the u.k. government bond market -- around 5/8 point lower at the longer end of the eurosterling market.     dealers said overseas investors had not been buying today and predicted consolidation before next week's u.k. budget. a 55 mln stg convertible issue for confectioners rowntree mackintosh was well bid at 104-5/8 105-1/8 pct and expected to go well.     euroyen bonds showed a firmer tone led by some professional short covering from tokyo. today's 23 billion deal for toyota motor credit with a 4-1/2 pct coupon was deemed tight however.  reuter &#3;</h3>
