	<h3>moody's investors service inc said it downgraded 3.4 billion dlrs of debt of beneficial corp.     cut to baa-2 from baa-1 were the senior debt of the company and the guaranteed debt of its unit, beneficial overseas finance nv.     also downgraded were beneficial's shelf registrations of senior debt to provisional baa-2 from provisional baa-1 and of subordinated debt to provisional ba-1 from provisional baa-3.     moody's said the magnitude of beneficial's 1986 operating losses from write-downs of discontinued businesses has weakened its financial position.     "the costs of meeting the potential liability for insurance losses to facilitate the sale of the company's insurance unit and of revaluing other discontinued business segments have substantially exceeded original indications," moody's said in a release.     the agency said beneficial's consumer finance business remains strong and has the capacity to withstand foreseeable adverse developments.     but the withdrawal from nontraditional businesses is weakening consolidated leverage, narrowing funding operations and depressing the quality of earnings, moody's stressed.  reuter &#3;</h3>
