	<h3><desjardins group>, the quebec credit union organization with 30 billion dlrs in assets, needs a new structure to raise capital and compete outside of quebec and is considering a share issue, president claude beland said.     beland said the group is considering forming a holding company which would raise capital by issuing preferred, non-voting shares.     "if we want to expand we have to look into other markets," beland said in an interview. "right now we have many opportunities but we don't have the tools to react properly," he said.     the co-operative organization, which was founded in 1900, said it accounts for 38 pct of quebec consumer loans, 50 pct of mortgage loans, and 18 pct of commercial loans in the province. it said it also controls quebec's largest life insurance company.              reuter &#3;</h3>
