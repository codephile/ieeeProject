	<h3>former u.s. secretary of state alexander haig has announced his intention to run for president.     haig, a former general and nato chief who served seven presidents but never held elected office, said he will formally announce his bid to run for the republican presidential nomination at a news conference later today.     haig's aides say he starts far back in the field of republican hopefuls, which is currently dominated by vice-president george bush and senate minority leader robert dole, neither of whom have yet declared their intentions.  reuter &#3;</h3>
