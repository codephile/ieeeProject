	<h3>japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 3.0 pct in january, the worst since the government started compiling unemployment statistics under its current system in 1953, up from the previous record 2.9 pct in december, the government's management and coordination agency said.     unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.     unadjusted january unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people, up from 1.61 mln in december and 1.65 mln a year earlier.     male unemployment in january remained at 2.9 pct, equal to the second-worst level set last december. record male unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in july 1986.     female unemployment in january remained at 3.0 pct, equal to the record level marked in april, august, september and december last year.     january's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in export-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation against the dollar, officials said.     employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders, down 170,000.  reuter &#3;</h3>
