	<h3>bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.     with money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in may and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark, schlesinger told reuters that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed.     the economy is picking up, after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth, he added. "we may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter," he said in an interview.     concerned by the first quarter downturn, the u.s. has been pressing west germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.     schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in 1986. year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.     he estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct.    "it is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly," he said, noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.     schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the bundesbank's three to six pct target.     he said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. heavy inflows, particularly in january around the time of the ems revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.     "there is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed," schlesinger said.     a major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction that the mark was headed higher. "as we can see from the market, expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished," schlesinger said.     the recent widening of interest rate differentials, the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.     asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise, as the u.s. did in march when the dollar rose above 1.87 marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.     at midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.     "central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but i cannot give any answer how they would react," schelsinger said.     "one has to look at how it (the market) is moving," he said, adding, "it is not only our own case, it is also the american case."     he said that the west german export industry has been hit hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now. "but it wouldn't be good to have short-term fluctuations," he said. "let us wait and see."     "it is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level (of rates) as such," schlesinger said.     the sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on west german inflation down year.     although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices. the underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.     schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term, in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.     the above-target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the mid-year meeting of the bundesbank's council, schlesigner said.     but he added: "i don't see any great pressure to go away from it."  reuter &#3;</h3>
