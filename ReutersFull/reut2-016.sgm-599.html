	<h3>honeywell inc said a gain of 20.1 pct in its 1987 first quarter operating earnings was the result of cost cutting efforts which began last year.     honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or 79 cts in the same period a year ago.     better operating results in each of the company's three  sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due to financing the december acquisition of sperry aerospace and the sharing of the federal systems subsidiary pre-tax profit with honeywell bull inc, honeywell said.     "our first quarter results show clear benefits of our restructuring," chairman edson spencer said. "all of our businesses are producing better results than last year, even though we do not see significant improvement in the external market environment," he said.     total orders in the first quarter were up substantially, with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in addition to those of the new sperry aerospace group, it said.     domestic industrial automation and control orders were modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.     orders in honeywell's home and building automation and control business were flat in the u.s. and up in international markets, it said.     international orders increased, with the greatest strength in europe, honeywell said.     the company said that by year-end 1987, it intends to complete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a five mln share buyback program which began in 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
