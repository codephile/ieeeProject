	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it downgraded six u.s. money center bank holding companies, affecting about 13.3 billion dlrs of debt securities.     they are chase manhattan corp <cmb>, chemical new york corp <chl>, irving bank corp <v>, manufacturers hanover corp <mhc>, mellon financial corp <mel> and security pacific corp <spc>.     s and p said the action on chase, chemical, irving and manufacturers primarily reflected continued vulnerability to lesser developed countries and median financial performance.     standard and poor's said its downgrade of chemical also reflected that holding company's acquisition of texas commerce bancshares <tcb>, which was just now approved by the federal reserve.     for mellon and security pacific, s and p cited higher non-performing assets and weaker operating earnings.     the rating agency said it completed a review, based on 1986 results, of the largest u.s. bank holding companies. it paid special attention to reassessing the effect of exposures to lesser developed countries on the holding companies' earnings and capital.     "brazil's unilateral moratorium on debt service payments underscored the potential for polarization between bankers and debtor countries," s and p said.     s and p noted that while argentina, brazil, mexico and venezuela each face unique economic problems, the lack of progress toward moderating their debt service burdens has been disappointing.     however, the agency pointed out that a substantive improvement in the large banks' financial positions has acted as a counter-balance to the latin american debt situation.     citing increasing financial strength, s and p said it affirmed the debt ratings of citicorp <cci>, bankers trust new york corp <bt>, bank of boston corp <bkb> and j.p. morgan and co inc <jpm>.     s and p noted that most u.s. bank holding companies have what it termed easily realizable capital resources available to them, such as undervalued real estate, appreciated portfolio securities and overfunded pension plans.     "most bank managements appear committed to improving the quality of their balance sheets," s and p said, noting many now emphasize long-term strategies over short-term earnings.     standard and poor's reduced chase manhattan's senior debt to aa-minus from aa, subordinated debt to a-plus from aa-minus and preferred stock to a from a-plus. the commercial paper of the parent and its unit chase manhattan bank of canada were affirmed at a-1-plus.     chase has 3.2 billion dlrs of debt outstanding. it has 6.4 billion dlrs of loans to argentina, brazil, mexico and venezuela - one of the highest exposures to lesser developed countries among u.s. money centers.     chase's underlying profitability remains at median levels because of its high expense structure, s and p said.     s and p cut chemical's and the unit chemical new york n.v.'s senior debt to aa-minus from aa and subordinated debt to a-plus from aa-minus.     about 1.2 billion dlrs of long-term debt was affected.     the agency cited chemical's relatively large exposure to latin american borrowers, particulary brazil and mexico, continued high levels of nonperforming assets and the pending acquisition of texas commerce.     aggregate exposure to argentina, brazil, mexico and venezuela was almost four billion dlrs at year-end 1986, or 105 pct of equity and reserves, s and p pointed out.     irving's senior debt was reduced to a-plus from aa-minus, with subordinated debt and preferred stock lowered to a from a-plus. its commercial paper was affirmed at a-111-1plus.     irving has about 500 mln dlrs of debt outstanding. its approximately 1.4 billion dlrs of loans to the four major latin debtor countries account for 110 pct of year-end equity and reserves.     s and p downgraded manufacturers hanover's senior debt to a from a-plus, subordinated debt to a-minus from a and preferred stock to bbb-plus from a-minus but affirmed its a-1 commercial paper. the bank has 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.     s and p noted that manufacturers has about 6.7 billion dlrs of loans to the major latin debtor nations and has experienced weak earnings.     however, the unit cit group holdings inc's aa-minus senior debt and a-1-plus commercial paper were affirmed.     the rating agency cut mellon's senior debt to a-plus from aa and preferred stock to a from aa-minus. it has 1.1 billion dlrs of debt securities.     the commercial paper programs of mellon bank canada and mellon australia ltd, guaranteed by the parent company, were lowered to a-1 from a-1-plus.     s and p cited continued lower operating earnings and rising nonperforming assets and charge-offs for mellon.     security pacific's 1.7 billion dlrs of debt was downgraded. cut were its senior debt to aa from aa-plus, and subordinated debt and preferred stock to aa-minus from aa.     security pacific overseas finance n.v.'s debt issues were reduced to aa from aa-plus. affirmed were the parent's a-1-plus commercial paper and the bbb-rated debt of the unit security pacific financial systems.     these actions reflected security pacific's continued high levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, s and p said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
