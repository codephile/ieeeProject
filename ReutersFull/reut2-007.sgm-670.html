	<h3>sonex research inc said its modified 1986 british ford escort passed the european emissions test, but reported the engine consumed 35 pct more fuel than the stock engine.     sonex said its engine is not equipped with a catalytic converter and does not use exhaust gas recirculation or an emission air pump. it said the company expected to realize a reduced fuel economy, but is working on improving fuel consumption.     the company said after it installs the new fuel system, it will retest the automobile.     in a separate announcement, the company said it received confirmation from the european patent office that sonex successfully defended its beta european patent from a competitor.  reuter &#3;</h3>
