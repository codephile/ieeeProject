	<h3>several traders and analysts here told reuters latin american coffee producers will meet this weekend in managua, nicaragua. the purpose, they said, is to review the breakdown of international coffee organization quota talks last month and try to formulate a unified position ahead of possible future negotiations.     two traders, who asked not to be named, said separately brazil is expected to attend the meeting along with most or all of the central american producers. the central american attendees would include costa rica and honduras, who were part of a minority producer group at the february talks that opposed brazil's position, they said.     another source, also requesting anonymity, said colombia probably will not attend.  reuter &#3;</h3>
