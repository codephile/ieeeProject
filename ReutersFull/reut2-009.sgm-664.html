	<h3>moody's investors services inc said it downgraded 200 mln dlrs of long-term debt of zenith electronics corp.     cut were zenith's senior debt to ba-2 from baa-3, convertible subordinated debt to b-1 from ba-2 and commercial paper to not-prime from prime-3.     moody's cited the company's overall losses.     the agency also said it believes that future profits in the consumer electronics business will be limited because of intense competition from international market participants.     moody's pointed out that zenith's total debt increased sharply over the past year and is being serviced by weak cash flow.     a spokesman for zenith criticized the action.     "the company believes the downgrade is unwarranted. operating results for 1986 improved over 1985 and zenith was profitable in the second half of 1986," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
