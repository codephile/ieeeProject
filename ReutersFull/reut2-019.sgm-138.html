	<h3>an organization of tennessee valley authority industrial customers said it has joined the tva in asking a court to prevent the u.s. department of energy from witholding contracted payments to tva.     the tennessee valley industrial committee said it is seeking permission to intervene in tva's federal district court lawsuit requesting doe be enjoined from witholding payments due under "minimum demand" provisions of the tva's contract to supply electricity to uranium enrichment facilities at oak ridge, tenn., and paducah, ky.         such provisions obligate tva to make available a certain amount of power and the customer -- in this case the doe -- agrees to pay the fixed costs associated with that amount of power whether is is used or not.     the committee represents 27 large, energy-intensive industries with operations in the tva service area. these industries, like doe, are served directly by tva as opposed to going through a local distributors.     the tva has said doe's intention, announced last week, to withhold increasing percentages of its electric bill will result in a revenue shortfall of about 250 mln dlrs and force an about six pct rate increase to all other customers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
