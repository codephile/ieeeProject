	<h3>the dollar straight sector of the eurobond market ended easier after a subdued day's trading as u.s. banks began to match yesterday's surprise 1/4 point prime rate hikes by citibank and chase manhattan bank, dealers said.     the prime rates were raised to 7-3/4 from 7-1/2 pct and the timing of the moves puzzled many dealers. however, reaction here was limited, with shorter dated paper ending steady to 1/4 point easier, while longer dates dipped by 1/4 to 1/2 point.     in the primary market, activity again centred on currencies other than the u.s. dollar, dealers noted.     one dollar straight dealer at a u.s. securities house commented "there was, in fact, the odd retail buyer today, but only in small sizes." he added that, ironically, the prime rate rises may help the market to stabilise since the dollar rose on the back of the news.     the only u.s. dollar deal launched during the day was, as has been the case recently, equity linked. the 15-year convertible bond was for the bank of tokyo ltd and has an indicated coupon of two pct. one source at a house involved in the deal said, "it's got to be a blow-out. with a name like this you're talking about japan inc."     the lead manager was the bank of tokyo international (boti) and the deal ended far above the par issue price at 108 109 pct. a boti official said "we've had worldwide interest in the deal."     she noted the tokyo stock market had experienced a mild correction at the beginning of the week but that bank stocks were hardly affected.     the yen sector edged slightly firmer and one new straight deal was launched, a 20 billion yen bond for france's caisse nationale des telecommunications. the state guaranteed five year bond pays 4-3/8 pct and was priced at 101-1/2 pct.     the issue was lead managed by ibj international ltd and was quoted on the grey market at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct compared with the total fees of 1-7/8 pct. one syndicate official at a firm not involved in the deal said "it's tight, but overall i would say its fairly priced."     also launched was a five-year zero coupon bond with a total redemption amount of 19 billion yen for rural banking and finance corp of new zealand. it was priced at 81.22 pct and lead managed by nomura international.     in the australian dollar sector, gmac (australia) finance ltd issued a 50 mln australian dlr bond.     hambros bank ltd was lead manager for the four-year deal which pays 14-1/4 pct and was priced at 101 pct. it was guranteed by general motors acceptance corp and was quoted on the 1-3/4 pct fees at less 1-3/4 pct bid.     mcdonalds corp issued a 75 mln canadian dlr bond paying 8-1/2 pct over five years and priced at 101-5/8 pct. it was quoted around the 1-7/8 pct fees at less two less 1-3/4 and was led by morgan guaranty ltd.     the european investment bank launched a 300 mln danish crown, seven-year, bond withan 11 pct coupon and pricing of 101 pct. it was lead managed by den danske bank.     the floating rate note sector basically ended easier following the increase in period eurodollar deposit rates prompted by the prime rate increases, dealers said. but they noted that mis-match deals - issues whereby the coupon is re-fixed on a monthly basis - were firmer.  reuter &#3;</h3>
