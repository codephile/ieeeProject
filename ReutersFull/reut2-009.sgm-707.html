	<h3>pacific dunlop ltd <paca.me> said studies by its <ansell international> latex-product unit have shown a commonly-used spermicidal cream kills the aids virus.     ansell regional director chris humphrey told a news conference the cream, already used in a condom brand as additional contraceptive protection, killed on contact the virus causing aids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).     the discovery meant sexually active people could have a second level of protection against aids if a condom ruptured during sex, humphrey said. "this is the best available protection against aids next to abstinence," he said.     but david pennington, the head of australia's government sponsored aids taskforce, said the use of the cream provided a slight safeguard but was no great breakthrough.     pennington said that in the event of a condom rupturing semen was likely to travel beyond the cream's range.     humphrey said the studies, commissioned by ansell from nelson gantz of the university of massachusetts and fred judson of the university of colorado, showed nonoxynol-nine destroyed the aids virus present in 100 pct of rupture tests.     but he said it was not known whether nonoxynol-nine was as effective in sexual situations.     he stressed it was neither a cure nor a vaccine for aids.     humphrey said nonoxynol-nine had been used for about 20 years as a spermicidal cream without side-effects.     analysts have attributed much of the rise in pacific dunlop's share price from 3.87 dlrs at the beginning of the year to a high of 5.36 dlrs to expected growth in its condom business. it closed today eight cents down at 4.67 dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
