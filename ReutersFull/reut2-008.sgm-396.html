	<h3>amalgamated bank of new york said three locals of the iron workers union will invest a portion of their pension funds in below-market, no-points amalgamated-written home mortgages for members.     the bank is owned by the amalgamated clothing and textile workers union.     it said about 18 mln dlrs has been set aside for the program and loans of up to 150,000 dlrs will be offered in fixed-rate and adjustable form.  the bank said if the program is successful, there will probably be a substantial increase in its funding, and it would expect other unions to look into the possibility of initiating programs for their own members.  reuter &#3;</h3>
