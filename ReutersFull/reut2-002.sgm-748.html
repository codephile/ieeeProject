	<h3>u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter said canada's finding announced today that u.s. corn imports injure canadian farmers is "totally unjustified."     "u.s. corn exports to canada are so small that it is inconceivable that they injure canadian corn farmers by any reasonable measure," yeutter said in a statement.     he said if other countries follow canada's lead it could result in "a rash of protectionist actions throughout the world." french corn growers have recently indicated they will challenge u.s. corn gluten feed shipments to europe.     yeutter said the u.s. will examine the canadian decision closely and if the u.s. believes the decision was not based on facts, "will carefully evaluate appropriate responses." yeutter did not say what steps the u.s. may take in response.  reuter &#3;</h3>
