	<h3>tanzania seeks to export a surplus of 200,000 tonnes of maize from last year's bumper harvest, agriculture minister paul bomani said yesterday.     the 1986 maize crop was officially estimated at 2.1 mln tonnes, but only a fraction of this was marketed, with most grain consumed by the farmers who grew it.     the state-owned national milling corp (nmc) meanwhile said it is trying to sell 190,742 tonnes of maize stored in different parts of the country.     nmc acting general manager john rubibira said tanzania has only 56,000 tonnes of silo storage capacity, concentrated in dar es salaam, arusha in the north and iringa in central tanzania.     in addition, the country has 450,000 tonnes of flat storage capacity, he added.     rubibira said the government is planning to build new silos in the main maize producing areas of iringa, mbeya, ruvuma and rukwa.  reuter &#3;</h3>
