	<h3>senate and house investigators into the iran arms scandal agreed to grant limited immunity to obtain the testimony of key witnesses and to combine their planned hearings.     chairmen of the separate senate and house select iran committees told a news conference they would accede to a request from special prosecutor lawrence walsh and hold off for 90 days before hearing testimony from oliver north and john poindexter, two former white house aides who played leading roles in the secret arms deal.     lee hamilton, chairman of the house committee, and daniel inoyue, chairman of the senate panel, also said they would "meld" their separate investigations, a move that will speed up congressional hearings into the affair.     one member predicted congress now would be able to finish its work by labor day in early september.  reuter &#3;</h3>
