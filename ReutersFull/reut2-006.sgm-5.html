	<h3>u.s. rep. dan glickman, d-kan., chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, said he would today introduce a bill to apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrains producers.     glickman told reuters the measure would allow 1987 winter wheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibility of receiving no less than 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much acreage they planted.     he also said his bill would protect program participants from reduced income payments in the event market prices rose above the loan rate.  reuter &#3;</h3>
