	<h3>president reagan said the united states would offer a draft treaty on medium-range missile reductions at talks with the soviet union in geneva tomorrow.     reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in the white house briefing room that he was summoning ambassador max kampelman and the other top u.s. arms negotiators home for consultations later this week. he said they will then return to geneva for detailed negotiations on the arms pact.     welcoming soviet leader mikhail gorbachev's offer saturday to proceed with a treaty on intermediate range nuclear forces (inf) separate from strategic and space weapons, reagan said: "this removes a serious obstacle to progress towards inf reductions."     "to seize this new opportunity i have instructed our negotiators to begin presentation of our draft inf treaty text at geneva tomoorrow," reagan said.     he said he wanted to stress that of the issues remaining to be resolved in the negotiations on medium-range u.s. and soviet missiles, "none is more important than verification ... any agreement must be effectively verifiable."     the united states has been working closely with allies and friends in europe and asia to develop a proposed treaty on reducing these weapons with an eye to their eventual elimination, the president said.      he said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreed upon with gorbachev at their summit meeting last october in reykjavik, iceland, which was shelved when the soviet leader insisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement on long-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense.     "i remain firmly committed to these objectives," he said.     he said gorbachev's new offer saturday ending the linkage of the three areas of negotiations removed a major barrier to agreement and was consistent with the soviet position at the earlier reagan-gorbachev summit in geneva in november 1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
