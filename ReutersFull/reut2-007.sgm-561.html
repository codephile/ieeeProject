	<h3>the bank of england said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a shortage of around 950 mln stg in the money market today.     among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain around 572 mln stg while a rise in note circulation wil take out some 280 mlns stg.     in addition, exchequer transactions and bankers' balances below target will remove some 85 mln stg and 15 mln stg for the system respectively.  reuter &#3;</h3>
