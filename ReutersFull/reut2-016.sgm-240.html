	<h3>hungary has announced sharp price increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.     the official mti news agency said the government decided consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state spending. from today the price of meat will rise by an average 18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, mti said.     the measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated economy, and could help dampen hungarians' appetite for imported western goods which consume increasingly expensive hard currency, the diplomats said.     the diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in other east bloc states, notably poland.     mti said consumer goods will also become more expensive, with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. it also announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including higher pensions and family allowances.  reuter &#3;</h3>
