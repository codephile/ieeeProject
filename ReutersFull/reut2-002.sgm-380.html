	<h3>the chairman of trw, inc said his company had overcharged the government on defense contracts but promised to prevent the improper conduct from recurring.     "there were a number of instances of mischarging and other irregularities in trw's defense contracting business," trw chairman ruben mettler said in testimony to the house oversight subcommittee.     "as the person ultimately responsible for the management of trw, i am determined to do everything in my power to prevent any recurrence," mettler said.     trw holds over 3 billion dlrs in defense contracts.     subcommittee chairman john dingell, a michigan democrat, said trw was being sued by the justice department and was being investigated by federal grand juries in colorado and cleveland.     mettler said the overcharges had been uncovered by trw's internal procedures and all were reported to the government.     "in every case we advised the government of our findings and committed to make restitution. we immediately put a stop to the practices in question and disciplined those who were culpable," he said.     mettler said trw had hired a new chief financial officer, a vice president of internal audit and a corporate controller. he said the internal audit department was being strengthened and a corporate review board had been established to monitor compliance activities.     he said a business ethics and conduct council had also been created and over 15,000 managers and employees would be given training programs on contract compliance.  reuter &#3;</h3>
