	<h3>france and yugoslavia agreed to set up a joint economic commission as part of efforts to promote commercial links and industrial cooperation between the two countries.     the french finance ministry said the commission, to be composed of businessmen, was agreed during talks between foreign trade minister michel noir and yugoslavian minister without portfolio egon padovan.     a ministry statement said both sides had agreed on the need to boost trade links in keeping with an accord signed last year calling for a 50 pct rise in commercial exchanges between the two countries over the next six years.     french trade with yugoslavia has grown little over the past two years.  reuter &#3;</h3>
