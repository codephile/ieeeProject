	<h3>representatives of south africa's standstill coordinating committee (scc) and its commercial bank creditors have agreed new terms covering repayments of 14 billion dlrs of debt, banking sources said.     the debt is covered by a standstill agreement that expires june 30.     under the new accord, the standstill will be extended for three years to june 30, 1990.     there will be an immediate repayment of three pct to all the banks, to be followed by various payments at six-month intervals over the life of the agreement totalling some 1.5 billion dlrs.     the three pct payment will be due july 15, 1987. subsequent repayments will be determined under a complex structure which will be based on the maturity structure of individual banks' loans, the bankers said.     the bankers, who declined to be identified, said the agreement also will give banks the option to convert their existing debt into term loans for 10-years, with five years grace.     an agreement reached last year allowed for the conversion of the short-term debt covered by the standstill into three-year loans.     bankers said today's talks concluded months of intense negotiations.     they said the south african finance ministry is expected to make a statement on the agreement later today.     a review of south africa's economy by the economic subcommittee of commercial banks is nearing completion and should be announced shortly, the bankers said.     no further details were immediately available.  reuter &#3;</h3>
