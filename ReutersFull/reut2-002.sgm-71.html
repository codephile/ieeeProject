	<h3>mci communications corp. called for immediate federal deregulation of american telephone and telegraph co., its principal competitor.     mci said it will ask the federal communications commission tomarrow to deregulate att in order to let marketplace forces govern the long distance telephone market.     "it's time to let the market manage att," mci president bert roberts told a news briefing here.     mci has seen its profits shaved recently by att long distance rate reductions ordered by the fcc following the breakup of the bell system.     the mci move signals its belief that att may raise profits rather than cut rates if deregulated.     to allay consumers' fears that deregulation might lead to price increases, roberts said one alternative open to the fcc would be adoption of a transitional "price cap" concept.     roberts noted that such a plan is backed by fcc commissioner dennis patrick, whose is widely expected to be named fcc chairman.     roberts conceded that att's deregulation posed risks to mci.     "the greater risk, however, is continuing the artificial market environment created by piecemeal fcc deregulation of att."  reuter &#3;</h3>
