	<h3>salomon brothers international's cmo eurotrust subsidiary is issuing a 228 mln dlr collateralised mortgage obligation priced at par and yielding 40 basis points over the three-month london interbank offered rate (libor), salomon said as lead manager.     however, interest, which is paid quarterly, cannot rise above 11.50 pct.     the stated maturity date of the issue is may 1, 2017, but the deal has an expected life of 3.6 years which will vary with the rate at which homebuyers prepay their mortgages     the pool itself consists of federal national mortgage association (fannie mae) securities paying 10.50 pct.     the issue settles on april 27 with no accrued interest.     salomon noted that the issue carries the lowest spread over libor of any cmo issued in the euromarkets to date.     in explaining the pricing, a salomon official noted that there has been very heavy demand for high-coupon u.s.agency mortgage issues such as fannie maes and that the rising price of the collateral must be passed along to investors.  reuter &#3;</h3>
