	<h3>treasury secretary james baker said he opposes a new tax on securities transactions.     "no," he said when asked by a reporter whether he favored such a tax, which has been advocated by house speaker james wright (d-tex).     he added, "not unless you want to tax a whole bunch of little security holders, which is not a good idea."  reuter &#3;</h3>
