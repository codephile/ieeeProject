	<h3>rolls royce, the u.k.'s state-owned car and aircraft engine maker, is seeking a 250 mln stg multiple option facility to provide it with additional sources of financing, banking sources said.     they said the facility, which will be syndicated among a small group of the borrower's relationship banks, is being put in place ahead of the privatisation of rolls royce in april or may. at the borrower's request, terms will not be disclosed until later this week, when bankers expect the syndication to close. but while the terms are in line with the market, they are somewhat tight, bankers said.     the bankers noted that although rolls royce's debt will be negligible after privatisation it wants to have a range of financing arrangements available to allow it to take advantage of market opportunities when they become available.     the financing will involve a 150 mln stg five-year committed tranche and will be backed by an uncommitted tender panel through which rolls royce will be able to issue bills or multi-currency advances.     s.g. warburg and co ltd is arranger for the financing, the bankers said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
