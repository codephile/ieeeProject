	<h3>the bank of england said it had invited those discount houses wishing to use borrowing facilities to do so at 1430 gmt today at a rate of 10 pct for 14 days.     this compares with the bank's present band one dealing rate of 10-3/8 pct.     the bank of england's announcement was quickly followed by barclays bank and national westminster bank which announced a half-point cut in their base rates to 10 pct from 10-1/2 pct.     dealers said the lowering in base rates had been widely expected following yesterday's u.k. budget in which chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced a three billion stg cut in the government's public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 to four billion stg.     many in the market had expected a full one point cut in base rates today but some were not surprised by the authorities' caution, dealers added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
