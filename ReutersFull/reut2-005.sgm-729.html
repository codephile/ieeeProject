	<h3>bankamerica corp chairman a.w. clausen said the bank holding company plans to go foward with its one-billion-dlr debt offering, but declined to specify when.     speaking to the san francisco chamber of commerce, clausen said that during the coming months, "at the appropriate time, we will be placing or underwriting for equities."     "we do need to improve our capital. we are in registration. for the moment, we filed a one-billion-dlr shelf registration for approval by the sec, which we believe will be approved very shortly," he said.     on january 26, bankamerica filed a shelf offering for up to one billion dlrs of preferred stock and subordinated capital notes.     the offering was seen by the banking industry as one of the major deterrents to first interstate bancorp's <i> take over bid, which it withdrew on february 9.     since then, banking analysts have speculated bankamerica may do well to defer action on the offering, while it continues to attempt to improve its financial situation.     clausen said despite improvement in the past quarter, bankamerica must do more to improve its capital ratios.  reuter &#3;</h3>
