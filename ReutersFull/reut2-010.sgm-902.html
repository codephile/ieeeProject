	<h3>enough european community (ec) states appear to be opposed to the proposals by the ec commission for a 330 european currency unit (ecu) a tonne tax on vegetable oils, fats and marine oils to block adoption by ec ministers, british farm minister michael jopling said.     he told a news conference held during a meeting here of ec agriculture ministers that britain, west germany, the netherlands, denmark, and portugal were all against the tax.     between them, these five countries had more than enough votes in the weighted voting system used in ec ministers' meetings to block a decision, jopling said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
