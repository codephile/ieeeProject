	<h3>president reagan made public a detailed set of orders to his national security staff designed to prevent scandals similar to the iran arms affair.     in a message to congress accompanying national security decision directive (nsdd) 266, reagan said: "(the reforms) are evidence of my determination to return to proper procedures, including consultation with the congress."     nsdds are normally classified. officials said this was the first time the duties of the national security staff had been spelled out in such a document since the national security council (nsc) was set up by congress 40 years ago.     the orders implement the recommendations of the tower commission, named by the president to investigate the secret u.s. arms sales to iran and led by former senator john tower.     in a scathing report on february 26, the panel blasted the conduct of the nsc staff and criticised the president for being unaware of many of the activities of his subordinates.     reagan accepted the report's conclusions in a speech on march 4 and said he had barred nsc staff from conducting covert operations. the prohibition is laid out in nsdd 266 which calls for a "small, highly competent (nsc staff) broadly experienced in the making of national security policy."     nsdd 266 said the organization should impose "clear vertical lines of control and accountability."     the eight page document said the nsc's use of private individuals and organisations as intermediaries to conduct covert activities would be "appropriately limited and subject to close observation."     it said the nsc staff should include a legal adviser who would have access to all information. the national security adviser should initiate periodic reassessments of policies and operations and ensure that consultations and presidential decisions are adequately recorded, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
