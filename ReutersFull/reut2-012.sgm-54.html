	<h3>total corn sales by argentina to the soviet union are only 1.5 to 1.8 mln tonnes, with delivery spread out from march to june, the u.s. agriculture department's counselor in buenos aires said in a field report.     the report, dated march 27, said many sources have stated that the soviet union was initially interested in purchasing 2.3 mln tonnes lof corn from argentina.     however, soviet purchases from the united states have tended to displace additional argentine purchases, the report said.     the usda has to date reported ussr purchases of 2.6 mln tonnes of u.s. corn for delivery in the current u.s.-ussr grain agreement year, which ends this september 30, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
