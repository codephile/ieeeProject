	<h3>the chairmen of the house and senate budget committees are in general accord on the need to cut the federal budget deficit by about 36 billion dlrs, half through new revenues, congressional sources said.     the sources told reuters senate budget committee chairman lawton chiles, a florida democrat, believes that it would be necessary to raise "at least" 18 billion dlrs in higher revenues--the same being proposed by house budget committee chairman william gray, a pennsylvania democrat.     the senate committee will hold its first drafting session on a budget tomorrow, the house group later in the week.     both sides want to meet a congressional target of april 15 for congressional approval of a new budget. however, the congressional budget office said that a deficit cut of 36 billion dlrs will fail to reach the gramm-rudman budget law goal of a 108 billion dlr deficit and would fall 27 billion dlrs short.      president reagan's budget, not accepted by either committee, proposed about 36 billion dlrs in deficit reductions--including some 22 billion dlrs in new revenues through asset sales and excise fees--off of an estimated deficit base of 144 billion dlrs.     reagan said his budget hits the gramm-rudman goal for 1988 but the congressional budget office said it is way off the mark with over optimistic economic assumptions.     currently, there are discussions underway by house and senate committees to redefine the fixed gramm-rudman targets for more realistic levels that can be reached, which would push off by a year or two the 1991 goal for a balanced budget, sources said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
