	<h3>commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said he would not object to the sale of computers to iran because the technology was that of u.s.-designed personal computers developed ten years ago.     "we have no reason not to ship it," baldrige told reporters after a senate banking committee hearing on export controls.     baldrige said the defense department's objection that the computers would be used in newspaper production was not a reason to bar the granting of an export license. "this is not a reason for denying it on foreign policy grounds," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
