	<h3>discussions on the possible extension of the sixth international tin agreement (ita) began at the quarterly session of the international tin council (itc) but the council is still waiting for decisions from various member states.     a number of producer governments in particular have not decided their final position on whether the ita should be extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on june 30, according to delegate sources.     earlier today european community (ec) members decided to back an extension, with the exception of britain, which undertook to communicate its decision to its ec partners later.     delegates said it could be friday before all the member countries declare their positions on the possible extension. today's full council session started shortly before 1500 gmt after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an ec coordination meeting.     the council reconvenes at 0930 gmt tomorrow, although delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor technical matters and the main issue will probably not be discussed before the afternoon session.  reuter &#3;</h3>
