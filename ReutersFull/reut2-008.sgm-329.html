	<h3>jefferies group inc said it resolved an accounting dispute with the staff of the securities and exchange commission resulting from a brokerage transaction in which the company acted as agent for buyer and seller.     the transaction resulted in a threat of litigation and a settlement involving a 1.2 mln dlr loss to jefferies group and a personal 3.8 mln dlr loss to former chairman boyd jefferies, the company said.     it also said the dispute was not related to the announced settlement with the sec and the resignation of boyd jefferies.     last month the company announced that the sec had questioned its fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings because of the method used by the company to account for the transaction.     in the sec's view, the 3.8 mln dlr loss incurred by boyd jefferies should have been recorded by the company  as a loss with a corresponding contribution to capital by jefferies, the company said.     jefferies group reported fourth quarter earnings of 4.3 mln dlrs, or 48 cts per share and income of 13.7 mln dlrs, or 1.55 dlrs per share for all of 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
