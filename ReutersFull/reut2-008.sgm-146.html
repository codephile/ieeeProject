	<h3>the bank of england said it forecast a shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today.     among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain around 1.18 billion stg while bankers balances below target will take out some 20 mln stg.     partly offseting these outflows, a fall in note circulation and exchequer transactions will add some 355 and 55 mln stg to the system respectively.  reuter &#3;</h3>
