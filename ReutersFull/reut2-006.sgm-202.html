	<h3>alcan aluminium ltd said it may issue up to two mln first preferred shares in addition to an unlimited number of additional common shares and an unlimited number of additional preference shares at any time after its proposed reorganization.     in a proxy statement, the company said shareholders are to vote on the reorganization, which would result in alcan's wholly-owned aluminum co of canada ltd unit replacing alcan aluminium as the group's parent company, at the april 23 annual meeting. the new company will keep the alcan aluminium ltd name.     alcan said it has no plans to immediately issue any of the additional shares.     the company has said it is undertaking the reorganization mainly to streamline management and give alcan a stronger and more stable financing base by making the new alcan a major operating company as well as a holding and management company.     "in an increasingly global capital market, this new structure should also provide for greater flexibility in financing the alcan group," the company said.     alcan's current only outstanding securities are common shares while the new company would have outstanding securities of common, preferred and preference shares, and its debt.     each shareholder would automatically become a shareholder in the new company without exchanging share certificates.     alcan later said it has a provision identical to the one detailed in the proxy statement allowing for the issue of preferred, common and preference shares, in its existing corporate structure.  reuter &#3;</h3>
