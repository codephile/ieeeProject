	<h3>the independent federation of flight attendants said u.s. district judge howard f. sachs entered a temporary restraining order prohibiting trans world airlines inc from refusing to recognize and deal with the union.     the union said the order also prohibits twa from denying union representatives access to the company's property.     the union said the kansas city judge acted on its complaints made seeking to enforce a recent u.s. court of appreals decision reinstating contractural provisions which existed at the time of the 70-day strike which ended in may 1986.     the flight attendants union said it petitioned the district court because of twa's ongoing refusal to allow union representatives on the airline's property.     the union said the court order also requires twa to post notices of a temporary restraining order throughout its system and to districute copies of the order to all its flight-attendant employees.     the union said the order requires the airline to appear in u.s. district court in kansas city march 20 to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted.  reuter &#3;</h3>
