	<h3>parliament passed laws increasing the amounts and frequency of treasury bill issues and allowing the government to raise up to 35 billion dlrs through issues of registered stock, bearer bonds and book-entry securities.     both steps are aimed at establishing a wider domestic capital market as part of singapore's plans to expand its financial sector, finance minister richard hu said.     banking sources said the new government securities market, scheduled to have been launched on march 2, had been delayed pending legislative approval of these bills.     the 35 billion dlrs maximum which may be raised under the development loan bill (1987), against a ceiling of 15 billion under current laws, is expected to satisfy demand for government securities over the next four years, hu said.     he said 6.1 billion dlrs of the 15 billion has so far been raised as development loans. the rest will be used up when bonds are issued to absorb advance deposits of 13.9 billion dlrs from the central provident fund (cpf), a mandatory pension savings scheme. workers and employers contribute a respective 25 pct and 10 pct of a worker's salary to the cpf, which had funds totalling 29.3 billion at end-1986.     regular government securities issues are needed to meet the demand of banks, insurance companies, other financial institutions and corporate and individual investors, hu said.     the monetary authority of singapore (mas) had said it planned to launch trading by issuing taxable instruments grossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38 billion dlrs of paper over the next five years.     funds raised in excess of the government's budgetary needs will not be channelled into increased spending, but will be recycled back to the financial system, largely through the mas, hu said.     hu said the current government securities market is rudimentary, with the cpf holding three-quarters of the outstanding debt and banks, discount houses and insurance companies holding the rest. "the concentration of securities in the hands of such long-term holders has left little scope for trading activity," he said.     "moreover, the maturity of the bonds, mostly 20 years, was not attractive to other investors who might have been expected to deal more actively in the market. the infrequency of bond issues exacerbated the lack of liquidity necessary for the development of a market," hu said.     hu said these obstacles have been resolved and regular issues of government securities will be made, initially carrying terms of up to five years and market-related yields.     the minimum denomination is 1,000 dlrs for notes and bonds -- aimed at individual investors -- and 10,000 dlrs for the treasury bills, which are directed at corporate investors.     eight primary and registered dealers have undertaken to make markets in order to ensure liquidity, he said.     hu said while the new government securities market will be essentially domestic, non-residents are free to invest, but interest earned will be subject to withholding tax.     hu said under the new treasury bills (amendment) bill, all book entries of borrowings through treasury bill issues must be made in records maintained by mas.     hu said that instead of physical certificates having to travel back and forth at each transaction, with side trips to the mas for registration, the mas will maintain a computerised system for updating records in a central register.     commercial banks and primary and registered government securities dealers will each have two securities accounts with the mas, one for their own holdings and the other for holdings on behalf of all their customers, hu said.     all trades will be reflected daily in changes in these accounts, hu said.     "these institutions will in turn act as custodians of government securities for their customers, rendering each an individual accounting of his holdings."     hu said the new system will cut storage and handling costs and paper work, reduce the danger of loss, theft, destruction and counterfeiting, and permit greater speed and efficiency in handling large volumes of transactions.  reuter &#3;</h3>
