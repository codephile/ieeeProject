	<h3><bank of new zealand> (bnz) shares will be listed on the new zealand stock exchange next week, probably on tuesday, the bnz said.     "we look forward to the challenge of public accountability through the open market," it said.     bnz, previously wholly owned by the state, issued 103 mln shares to the public in february, or nearly 13 pct of its capital, to raise 180.25 mln n.z. dlrs.     the publicly held shares will not have voting rights.     the government will retain 87 pct of the bnz's capital, a total of 800 mln ordinary shares.  reuter &#3;</h3>
