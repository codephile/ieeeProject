	<h3>rep. pat roberts, r-kan., predicted the reagan administration within the next ten days to two weeks will offer subsidized wheat to the soviet union under the export enhancement program, eep.     roberts made the comment at a press conference held by republican members of the house agriculture committee.     he did not say on what he based the comment, but an aide said roberts had been in touch with top republican officials recently.     the possibility of an expansion of eep to include wheat to moscow has been rumored for some time, and some industry sources believe a decision on the issue will be made by the reagan administration before secretary of state george shultz goes to moscow in april.  reuter &#3;</h3>
