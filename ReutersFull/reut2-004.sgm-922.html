	<h3>a proposal by the chicago mercantile exchange's (cme) board of directors to restrict dual trading by stock-index futures floor brokers would not provide a solution to alleged abuses in the market, house small business committee chief economist john helmuth said.     helmuth worked on legislation offered earlier this week by rep. neil smith (d-iowa) to ban dual trading in the standard and poor's 500 stock index futures trading pit.     last night the cme board recommended curbing, but not banning, dual trading in s and p 500 futures and options.     the cme board rejected a petition presented in february by some members seeking an outright ban on dual trading, whereby  floor brokers trade for their own accounts as well as for customers.     helmuth said the board's proposal would not prevent traders from falsifying the record that shows the times of their trades.     helmuth predicted smith's bill would be closely examined by the house energy and commerce committee, chaired by rep. john dingell (r-michigan). dingell and his staff were unavailable for comment.  reuter &#3;</h3>
