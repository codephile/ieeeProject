	<h3>a spokesman for jardine matheson holdings ltd <jard.hk> said he could neither confirm nor deny a newspaper report which said jardine was thinking of moving its listed property subsidiary <hongkong land ltd> to bermuda.     "i don't know how the report was originated ... i cannot comment," the spokesman at jardine's london office said when asked to react to a report in the daily telegraph newspaper.     the report said jardine, which moved its place of domicile from hong kong to bermuda in the wake of the agreement to transfer the british colony back to china in 1997, was contemplating a similar move for hongkong land.     the daily telegraph quoted jardine chairman simon keswick as saying hongkong land was at a crossroads now that all its non-property assets as well as its major residential properties in hong kong are being sold off.     this left the company to focus its attention on prime site commercial property in hong kong's city centre only, it said.     "if we can't find any opportunities here we may have to look abroad ... if we look abroad the structure of the company becomes very important," keswick was quoted as saying.  reuter &#3;</h3>
