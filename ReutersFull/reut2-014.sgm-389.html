	<h3>u.s. credit markets were mixed in dull trading at midsession, with moderate losses in coupon issues and treasury bill rates near unchanged.     bills improved slightly on remarks from federal reserve chairman paul volcker that a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to investment and that last week's increases in u.s. banks' prime lending rates to 7.75 pct from 7.50 pct was not connected with fed policy, dealers said.      coupon issues were 1/32 to 5/16 lower, pressured by a weak dollar. treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basis points lower to one basis point higher.     the key 7-1/2 pct treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95-26/32 to yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close.     dealers said remarks from federal reserve chairman paul volcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough to narrow the u.s. trade deficit and warning that a further, sizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had little exchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of his views.     in any case, they said the dollar is expected to be under pressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nations meet this week in washington, which may hurt bonds.     dealers said three-month bill rates had eased early in the session on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, but that otherwise there was little activity in this sector.     "when volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because it makes people think the fed is not going to tighten," a bill trader said. "but it's a nervous trade, with no real buyers."     three-month bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis points below their price at yesterday's auction, while six-month bills rose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.     year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.     most economists expected the federal reserve to supply temporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirect injection via customer repurchase agreements rather than a direct injection via two-day system repurchases which the fed conducted at its usual intervention time.     the fed intervened when federal funds were trading at 6-1/8 pct. funds opened at this level and remained there at midday, down from yesterday's 6.20 pct avearge.     the 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/32 to 99-21/32 at midday and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 9/32 to 97-27/32.  reuter &#3;</h3>
