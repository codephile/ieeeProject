	<h3>the french treasury has decided to repay 680 mln francs of debt issued before 1950, the finance ministry said.     seven issues, accounting for 0.13 pct of total state domestic debt, would be redeemed by the caisse d amortisement de la dette publique, the national debt amortisation fund, a ministry statement said.     the ministry said the debt rationalisation exercise, similar to one carried out in 1958 and 1959, would take out of circulation old issues which were expensive to manage and difficult to trade because of their highly complex structure.     technical details of the operation would be announced in the next few days.     the securities to be redeemed would be the three pct perpetual rente, five pct perpetual rente, four pct 1941-1960 redeemable rentes, 3.5 pct 1942-1952 redeemable rentes, three pct 1942-1955 redeemable rentes, three pct 1945-1954 redeemable rentes, and 4.5 pct 1933-1960 redeemable treasury bonds.     the ministry said the operation would mainly benefit long-term holders of the issues, mainly small investors and small communes.     the issues were difficult to trade because they comprised securities of variable nominal value, it noted.  reuter &#3;</h3>
