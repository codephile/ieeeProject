	<h3>burma's paddy production fell to 729.4 mln baskets in fiscal year 1986-1987 (to end march) from 737.3 mln in 1985-1986, a cabinet report to parliament said.     a basket is a local measure equal to 46 lbs.     paddy output in 1984-1985 was 699.1 mln baskets, it said.     burma's "green revolution" sparked by the introduction of high-yield variety paddy strains in the mid-1970s appears to have hit a plateau with production levelling off over the past two years, economists said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
