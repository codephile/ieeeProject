	<h3>bankers trust new york corp said it has placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.     brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on february 22.     u.s. banking regulations do not require banks to stop accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue, but bankers trust said it acted now because of "the high potential of a continued suspension that would result in reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987."     assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are received for the rest of 1987, bankers trust estimated that full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.     bankers trust said it assumes that debt negotiations between brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the resumption of interest payments.     the negotiations resume in new york on friday when central bank governor francisco gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on april 15.  reuter &#3;</h3>
