	<h3>federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said a bill passed this week by the senate banking committee is too restrictive regarding the federal reserve.     "i don't think our hands should be tied so much as in that bill," he said.     the bill would set a one-year moratorium on approval of certain powers that banks have already applied to the federal reserve for -- selling insurance, securities and real estate.     volcker added, however, that comprehensive new legislation dealing with such issues is needed.  reuter &#3;</h3>
