	<h3>former national security adviser john poindexter told president reagan on two occasions in 1986 that profits from arms sales to iran were being diverted to nicaraguan rebels, according to a time magazine report.     poindexter resigned as head of the national security council (nsc) last november when the reagan administration disclosed he was aware part of the profits from the arms sales were diverted to contra rebels in nicaragua.     the report in time quoted unnamed friends of poindexter's as saying he felt he was following reagan's orders and that he kept the president adequately informed.     "indeed, he is likely to testify that on at least two occasions in 1986, he told reagan in general terms that the contras were being helped as an ancillary or side benefit of the arms deal with iran," time said.     reagan has repeatedly denied he knew anything about the diversion of arms sales profits to the contras.     in his nationally televised march 19 news conference reagan told reporters poindexter and fired nsc aide oliver north "just didn't tell me what was going on."     poindexter has been granted limited immunity so he can testify in congressional hearings on the affair.  reuter &#3;</h3>
