	<h3>the world bank, citing pakistan"s progress in its economic performance and fiscal policy reforms, said it had agreed a 2.4 billion dlr aid programme for 1988.     the bank said in a statement "substantial increases" had been approved to help fund support for refugees from neighbouring afghanistan.     but the bank said it had expressed serious concern at pakistan"s budget. "this year"s overall budget deficit is expected to be larger than either either last year"s outcome or the amount originally budgeted (for 1987)," it added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
