	<h3><dairy farm international holdings ltd> obtained a 1.2 billion h.k. dlr loan from the hongkong and shanghai banking corp to finance its tender offer for a 22 pct stake in kwik save discount group plc <kwik>, dairy farm chairman simon keswick told reporters.     he did not disclose the terms of the loan but said they were "fairly fair."     dairy farm said earlier in a statement it would offer to buy up to 32.58 mln kwik save shares at 4.50 stg each, raising its stake in the retail firm to 25 pct from 3.5 pct now.     keswick said dairy farm wanted to obtain at least 15 pct of kwik save, which would make it kwik save's biggest shareholder, otherwise it would dispose of its entire stake.     kwik save opened at 4.45 stg, up from yesterday's 3.90 stg close.  reuter &#3;</h3>
