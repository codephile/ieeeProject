	<h3>klm royal dutch airlines <klm.as> is discussing marketing cooperation with u.s. regional carrier air atlanta inc but it is not seeking to take a stake in the airline, a klm spokesman said.     "we're not considering taking either a majority or minority stake in air atlanta, but we are thinking of providing them with a loan," the spokesman told reuters in a comment on a wall street journal report saying debt-laden air atlanta could sell as much as 25 pct of its stock to the dutch airline.     klm last week denied a dutch press report saying it was discussing a takeover of air atlanta.     the klm spokesman said air atlanta's regional route network, centred on atlanta, ga, could serve as a feeder to klm's international network, which includes direct flights between atlanta and amsterdam.     klm and air atlanta had been talking "for some time," he said, but declined to elaborate further on the talks or give details of the loan to air atlanta.  reuter &#3;</h3>
