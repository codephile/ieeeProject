	<h3>iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the gulf war ends.     the surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in iraqi air force action.     it also followed celebrations yesterday of what baghdad hailed as iran's failure to achieve victory during the iranian year which ended on saturday.     a high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at iran's kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.     the kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since august 1985, was last raided in january.     the communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.     in london, lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton iranian tanker avaj was hit on saturday, when iraq reported an earlier gulf attack.     but there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by baghdad in the past 24 hours.     the last confirmed iraqi attack took place on march eight, when the iranian tanker khark-5 was hit south of kharg.     iraqi warplanes also struck iran's offshore oilfields at nowruz, cyrus and ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of kharg island, today's communique said.     the three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. oil sources said they were not crucially important to iran's oil export trade.     a second high command communique today said iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against iranan targets and positions at the war front.     it also reported a clash between iraqi naval units and several iranian boats carrying men to attack an iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the gulf.     two iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their occupants and the others fled, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
