	<h3>members of the united food and commercial workers union, ufcw, local 222 voted sunday to go on strike against iowa beef processors inc dakota city, nebraska, plant, effective tuesday.     the company submitted their latest offer to the union at the same time announcing that they would end the lockout as of tomorrow that started december 14.     members unanimously rejected the latest company offer that was submitted to the union late last week. an overwhelming majority of the approximately 2,500 members attending the meeting then voted to go on strike, ufcw union spokesman allen zack said.     zack said the company's offer for a cut in wages was unacceptable and said ibp was refusing to bargain in good faith.     ibp's latest offer included wage cuts of 60 cents an hour for slaughter operations and a 45 cents an hour cut in pay for processing workers. the cut follows the 1.07 dlr cut in pay workers received in 1982 and the wage freeze that has lasted since then, zack said.     the offer also eliminated overtime after eight hours following the normal 40 hour work week, he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
