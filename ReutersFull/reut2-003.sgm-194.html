	<h3>disposable income available to people employed in european community agriculture rose 0.9 pct in 1986 after an 8.8 pct fall the previous year, the ec statistics agency eurostat said in a report.     it said income available to farm holders and members of their family working on the holding rose 2.5 pct after a 13.9 pct fall in 1985.     eurostat said the reason for the increases was higher production, with a 1.6 pct increase in crop output and a 0.7 pct rise in animal products compared with 1985.     however, eurostat added a 1.6 pct fall in prices for animal products was more than offset by a 3.1 pct increase in those for crops.     it said income changes varied widely across the ec in 1986. disposable income of all those employed in agriculture rose 12.9 pct in west germany but fell 7.8 pct in denmark, while income available to holders and their families rose 17.0 pct in britain but fell 9.7 pct in ireland.  reuter &#3;</h3>
