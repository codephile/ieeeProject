	<h3>canadian bonds closed slightly lower on market jitters amplified by rumors that a big holder of domestic bonds was selling early in the day, dealers said.     the market had opened 1/4 to 3/8 point stronger on news of unexpectedly weak u.s. employment data for march, but the advance sparked profit-taking which forced prices down about 1/4 point on the day. rumors of a major seller were not confirmed but some traders felt limited potential for further canadian dollar gains might be taking some of the shine off domestic bonds. the benchmark canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001 ended at 106-1/4 3/8 and the 8-1/2 pct of 2011 at 97-1/4 1/2.  reuter &#3;</h3>
