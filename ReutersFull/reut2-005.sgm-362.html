	<h3>u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng said it is too late to implement a full 0/92 acreage provision, or "decoupling," for 1987 grain crops.     "i think there's a chance we'll see that legislation (0/92) passed, (but) not for 1987 crops. it's too late," lyng told the national grain and feed association convention here.     lyng added that there seems some support in congress for 0/92 and there was a good chance a pilot 0/92 program will be passed as part of a pending disaster bill.     but he indicated that it is already too late in the year to alter the 1987 crop program. sign-up for spring crops closes the end of this month.     overall, lyng predicted very little change will be legislated in the 1985 farm bill this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
