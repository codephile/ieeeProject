	<h3>the west german finance ministry said the cabinet will discuss a bill on wednesday to increase tax cuts by an extra 5.2 billion marks next year to a total of 13.7 billion marks.     the additional tax cuts were agreed within the government coalition in early march after finance minister gerhard stoltenberg pledged at the six-nation monetary conference in paris in february to increase the size of the 1988 tax cuts.     the bill will be presented in parliament at a later, unspecified date after the cabinet's deliberations.  reuter &#3;</h3>
