	<h3>treasury secretary james baker and federal reserve board chairman paul volcker have told house leaders they were optimistic their debt strategy would work, but acknowledged the crisis could take a sharp turn for the worse, congressional sources and u.s. officials said.     baker and volcker gave these views at closed-door talks  yesterday with speaker jim wright and other house leaders.     but the two architects of the third world debt strategy gave no indications they would abandon their plan to promote economic growth and reform.     "they expressed optimism about the current state of affairs," one participant at the meeting said.     however baker and volcker, accompanied by deputy secretary of state john whitehead, acknowledged there were risks. "and if things turned sour, they could turn very sour," a source quoted them as saying.     they were responding to questions from wright, a texas democrat, who called the meeting two weeks ago because of his concern the debt crisis was deepening, an aide said.     the speaker asked all three men about the risks to latin american democracy and the danger that demagogues of either left or right could wrest control and halt debt repayments.     even though the fed chief joined baker in expressing more confidence in an optimistic outcome, volcker was especially concerned about the political risks, and in particular the  fatigue with belt-tightening. the central banker said resolving the debt crisis would be a "struggle".     since taking over the speakership at the start of the year, wright has shown himself an able political adversary of the administration on budget strategy.     his involvement in this issue also seems to signal that congressional interest in the debt problem has to be taken more seriously now than in the past.     more worrisome for administration strategists is the possibility that congressional debt proposals essentially granting debt relief will be attached to a trade bill.     "when (baker and volcker) left the speaker's office, they knew it wasn't just talk," one source at the meeting said.     the two economic policymakers listened patiently to descriptions of plans for a third world debt facility, backed by gold reserves of the international monetary fund.     the agency could buy up or guarantee developing country debt at a discount and resell it to debtor nations undertaking economic reforms.     the u.s. treasury would be required to ask other countries for their views under a bill approved by a house banking subcommittee and sponsored by john lafalce, a new york house democrat. a similar proposal is being fashioned by bruce morrison, a house democrat from connecticut.     the sources said house banking and foreign affairs leaders also attended the discussions.     u.s. officials said both schemes are regarded by the administration as providing debt relief. baker said yesterday the concept of debt relief was misguided. "if we write it all off and declare defeat, these countries will decay and wither on the vine," the treasury secretary said of an end to capital inflows that would follow debt relief.     baker has said his own plan was broad and would embrace new innovative ideas bringing together debtors and creditors.     baker and volcker launched their in late 1985, calling on commercial and multilateral banks to increase loans to major debtors pursuing inflation-free expansion and open markets.     "they sat down together to discuss the implications for latin america and feel each other out on the best way out," a wright aide said of the meeting. other sources said they expect the dialogue to continue.     the talks come after brazil's interest rate moratorium and an uncompromising stand by the country's finance minister, dilson funaro, after talks with western leaders.     some u.s. officials feel funaro's consolidation of power over the brazilian economy with the ouster of planning minister joao sayad is further reason to worry.     another proposal, to allow regulators to grant commercial banks more flexibility in accounting for third world loans, has been presented by senator bill bradley, a new jersey democrat, but did not come up yesterday.     wright, who has not hitherto concerned himself with debt, "is concerned about the potential for damage. the latin american issue, at least on the surface appears to be a new danger," said an aide, who asked not to be named.     there are signs the brazilian situation and a reluctance by commercial banks to join in new cash loans even for debtors following substantial reforms has concerned u.s. officials.     at the state department, secretary of state george shultz is being advised the "baker plan is going through a rough patch" while treasury officials are urging commercial banks to adopt more flexible approaches to guarantee their continued participation in the plan.      reuter &#3;</h3>
