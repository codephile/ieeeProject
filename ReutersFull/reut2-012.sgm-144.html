	<h3>french prime minister jacques chirac said that on financial issues, the united states and france had "very close" views, and he said treasury secretary james baker was determined to support the february 22 paris agreement on stabilizing foreign exchange parities.     "i was very reassured by the determination of mr. baker to support this agreement," he said.     he described the dollar's sharp fall against the yen at the start of the week as a "passing incident" and added, "everyone is resolved to support the paris accord."     questioned about his plan to help the world's poorest countries, chirac said he did not envisage any large-scale debt write-offs.     "i don't think we can talk of write-offs - even the poorest countries have not asked for that," he said.     chirac said he wanted commercial banks to give third world countries better terms in rescheduling their debts, and for the international monetary fund to soften its conditions.     "one cannot pity the banks - they bear a lot of responsibility due to the encouragement they gave to these countries to take on debts. now the banks are complaining but i do not weep for them."  reuter &#3;</h3>
