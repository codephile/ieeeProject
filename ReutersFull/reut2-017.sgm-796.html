	<h3>kendall refining co, a unit of witco corp, and the <knox truck stop> chain, said they have developed one of the nation's first fast-oil-change centers for trucks outside of dallas.     the service, called fast lube, offers a 60-minute oil change and inspection service for trucks and also involves a used-oil analysis program that relays engine information to the driver's fleet headquarters, the companies said.     according to the companies, fast-oil-change centers are expected to grow from the current three pct of the oil lubrication market to 15 pct by 1990.         in addition, kendall said it recently launched a national fast lube program with <avis inc> that provides participating avis lube franchises with lubricants, equipment and marketing support.  reuter &#3;</h3>
