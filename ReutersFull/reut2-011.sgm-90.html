	<h3>the texas weekly usda state crop report said stormy winter weather limited fieldwork before conditions improved later in the week.     a snowstorm caused some cattle deaths in the panhandle, and cold, wet weather covered many areas. windy weather followed to dry fields and limit planting delays.     small grains made good progress despite cool temperatures which slowed growth. additional moisture was needed in some areas. many fields were booting and some were beginning to head. wheat was rated 16 pct fair, 56 pct good and 28 pct excellent.     corn and sorghum planting progressed, and land preparation was ahead of schedule in the plains despite snowy weather. cotton planting progressed in the lower valley.  reuter &#3;</h3>
