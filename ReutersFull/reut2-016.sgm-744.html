	<h3>japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa told a press conference he expects the u.s. trade deficit to eventually start reflecting economic fundamentals, which should influence exchange rates.     the minister was not referring to the u.s. trade data to be released in washington later today.     miyazawa also said he told major industrial nations when he was in washington last week that present exchange rates are not necessarily good. he had said earlier in washington that current exchange rates were within levels implied in the february paris currency accord.  reuter &#3;</h3>
