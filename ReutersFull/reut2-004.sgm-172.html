	<h3>u.k. retailers expect consumer spending to accelerate in march after a disappointing increase in february, according to a monthly survey by the confederation of british industry (cbi).     fifty-nine pct of the 325 retailers questioned for the latest distributive trades survey expected sales to be higher in march than they were in march 1986, with only six pct expecting lower sales.     the chairman of the distributive trades survey panel, nigel whittaker, said a favourable budget next week would further help sales during the summer.     figures released earlier this week showed retail sales in january fell 2.2 pct, mainly due to exceptionally cold weather.     "sales did not recover in february as much as retailers had expected, and they are now looking for better business in march," today's survey said.     it reported clothing stores were the most optimistic, with 80 pct expecting sales in march to be higher than a year ago.     wholesalers also expected stronger sales in march, while both retailers and wholesalers reported slower growth in import penetration, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
