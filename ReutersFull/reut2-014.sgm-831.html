	<h3>thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5 billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a year ago, the business economics department said.     it said janunary/march imports rose to 65.1 billion baht from 58.7 billion. thailand's improved business climate this year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials and semi-finished products.     the country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the first quarter due to lower oil prices.     the department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6 billion baht from 56.6 billion.     export growth was smaller than expected due to lower earnings from many key commodities including rice whose earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26 pct and canned pineapples seven pct.     products registering high export growth were jewellery up 64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
