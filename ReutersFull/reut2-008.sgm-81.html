	<h3>france and west germany have reached broad agreement on design specifications for a joint combat helicopter for the 1990s, the french defence ministry said.     a ministry spokesman said french defence minister andre giraud and his west german counterpart manfred woerner had "agreed in principle" on a common concept for the helicopter during talks in bonn on friday.     a joint commission will now be formed to work with firms involved in project and present a final report by july, he added.     the project, first drafted in 1984, calls for the french company <aerospatiale> and <messerschmitt-boelkow-blohm> of munich to develop and build 400 helicopters for the french and west german armed forces.     its development, seen as a test of europe's ability to collaborate on arms projects, has been dogged by different views on what type of helicopter to build and how to equip it.  reuter &#3;</h3>
