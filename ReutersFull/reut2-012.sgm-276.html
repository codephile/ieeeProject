	<h3>diamond shamrock executives said that to reduce the vulnerability to takeover pressures, they want to raise the value of the two companies to be formed by splitting diamond shamrock.     "if we can get the price up to the value of the company, we will not be vulnerable to takeover pressure," said charles blackburn, diamond shamrock's president and soon to be chief executive officer of the new exploration and producing company whose name has not yet been decided. he was visiting new york for talks with investors.     after successfully countering a takeover bid launched by t. boone pickens in january, diamond shamrock said it would spinoff its refining and marketing operation into diamond shamrock refining and marketing co before its april 30 annual meeting.     blackburn told reuters, "our advisors told us that a split would give a better share value to investors and that the market would give better multiples for pure refining and marketing and exploration and production plays."     the two companies are now in the process of organizing themselves to become "pure plays," the executives said.     blackburn said the new company would be a pure exploration and production operation and that he was looking to divest non-oil and gas operations, particularly diamond shamrock's coal operations.     blackburn said that "we are in talks about coal operations but i cannot discuss this further at this time."     he said the company would have a debt-to-capital ratio of about 38 pct, which could be paid down over time.     blackburn said the company would seek to generate further internal savings from rationalizing operations and personnel reductions. he has set a goal of 73 mln dlrs in internal savings and "we need to get at least 20 mln dlrs of that savings in 1987," blackburn said.     "i would rather describe this as savings coming from eliminating non-essential activities as we purify the exploration and production business."     "there are some people associated with those activities but it is more a matter of cutting and trimming rather than wholesale changes," blackburn said.     blackburn intends to run a tight ship in which dividends will not initially be paid and the resultant savings invested into exploration and production.     "our goal is to find 20 mln barrels a year in the u.s. to replace our production and i think that we can do this at the level we intend to spend," blackburn said.     "it might be more difficult to find more oil and more oil internationally at these levels," he added.     blackburn said that his new company would spend 75 mln dlrs in north america and 90 mln dlrs overseas, mainly indonesia, in the search for oil and gas reserves.     in 1986 diamond shamrock produced 82,473 mln barrels a day of oil with 83 pct of that from indonesia, while gas output was 265.6 mln cubic feet a day of which 98 pct was in the u.s.     blackburn said that he believed he could find oil to replace this production at low costs which were 4.97 dlrs a barrel worldwide and 3.88 dlrs a barrel in the u.s..     blackburn also said that the company would be willing to buy reserves, "if we can find the right producing properties at the right price".     blackburn estimated that oil prices will average about 18 dlrs a barrel this year with average prices received for natural gas at 1.57 dlrs per thousand cubic feet.     blackburn said he currently estimates that at thee prices for its products the company will have a cash flow of about 280 mln dlrs.     "this will mean a net negative cash flow as we pretty much spend our cash flow to find more oil and gas."     blackburn said the company will search for both oil and gas "almost exclusively in estasblished basins".     roger hemminghaus, who will be chairman of the new diamond shamrock refining and marketing co, which last year had sales of approximately 1.6 billion dlrs, told reuters his company was taking on some debt.     "we are taking on some 400 mln dlrs new debt with three tier financing emphasizing a revolving loan, some term loans and some unsecured private placement and are now in the latter stages of signing an agreement."     chemical new york corp <chl> is the company's lead banker on the loan, hemminghaus said.     that debt will set the company off at a 60 pct debt-to- capital-ratio, which hemminghaus said "is too much. to alleviate that we will hold our capital expenditures down and pay down debt so that at the end of two years that ratio will be reduced to mid 40 pct range."     hemminghhaus said that cash flow will be "plus or minus about 100 mln dlrs a year from earnings and depreciation."     in terms of major projects, hemminghaus said that capital expenditures will be 35 mln dlrs to 50 mln dlrs spread over all of the company's projects.     its major project will be a two year upgrading project on its mckee reinery in the panhandle at 90,000 bpd rated capacity.     the company also has a refinery south of san antonio where it will be headquartered with a capacity of 35,000 bpd.  reuter &#3;</h3>
