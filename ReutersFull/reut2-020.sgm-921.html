	<h3>european community commission president jacques delors called for a swift convening of a meeting of the g-7 countries following the instability in today's trading on world money and stock markets.     he told a press conference here: "g-7 should meet discreetly and quickly."     delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the mark to levels around 1.60, the european monetary system would undergo a "test by fire."     delors said the current problems in the markets had been caused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessive deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing circumstances.     he said it was "profoundly unjust" to blame it on recent increases in west germany.  reuter &#3;</h3>
