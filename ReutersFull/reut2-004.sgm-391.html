	<h3>u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present purpose because the u.s. price is not above the world price.     asked in an interview if it was time to consider a marketing loan for soybeans, lyng said, "i don't think so. i don't think the world price is lower than our price anyway."     however, the usda secretary said that if current conditions of surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to consider a marketing loan.     "i suppose that under that condition there is a danger our exports will continue to drop and that the government will continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans," he said. "it might be (worth contemplating a marketing loan), if there were a world market that was lower than our market."  reuter &#3;</h3>
