	<h3>philippines' board of investments (boi) has approved new guidelines on making cars but is still awaiting rules on the tax component of the programme, trade and industry secretary jose concepcion said.     he said the authorities were still deciding how much tax will be levied on locally-assembled cars.     the new car development programme replaces an earlier scheme and is designed to limit the number of car manufacturers in the local market.     the scheme is to be unveiled before the end of the month.     the two accredited local car manufacturers are <pilipinas nissan inc>, which gets car kits from nissan motor company ltd <nsan.t> and <philippine automotive manufacturing corp> which gets supplies from mitsubishi corp <mitt.t>.     three companies which pulled out due to what they saw as poor market conditions were ford philippines, a subsidiary of ford motor co <f>, general motors pilipinas, a subsidiary of general motors corp <gm> and <delta motors corp>.     toyota motor corp <toyo.t>, which was the foreign partner of delta motors, has applied for a place in the new programme and is negotiating the purchase of delta's assembly plant.     concepcion declined to say how many car assemblers would be allowed to operate, but said they will be required to finance 75 pct of the foreign exchange needed to import completely-knocked-down kits.     the balance will be provided by the central bank, he said.     the trade minister, who is also chairman of the boi, said the programme is intended to develop a car parts industry by requiring car firms to use locally-made spare parts. he said the plan should keep car prices at "reasonable levels."     tax currently accounts for 40 pct of the total cost of a car.  reuter &#3;</h3>
