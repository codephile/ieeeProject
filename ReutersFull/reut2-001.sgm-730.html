	<h3>prospects for renewal of the five-year u.s./ussr grains agreement are uncertain at this point, a soviet trade official told reuters.     the current trade imbalance between the united states and the soviet union, high u.s. commodity prices, and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain, albert melnikov, deputy trade representative of the soviet union, said in an interview.     the current agreement expires on sept 30, 1988.     melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975.     statements from both u.s. and soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was.     "we have had one agreement. we have had a second agreement, but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with prices," melnikov said.     "i cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement.... i do not want to speculate on what will happen after sept 30, 1988," he said.     melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from soviet government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal of the agreement.     "the situation is different in comparison to three, five or ten years ago ... we can produce more," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
