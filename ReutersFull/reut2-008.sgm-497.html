	<h3>talks have occurred between britain and the offshore financial centers of the channel islands and the isle of man aimed at reaching a pact to limit insider dealing, corporate affairs minister michael howard said.     he told parliament in a written answer that "there have been informal talks at official level. i would hope, in due course, to arrive at arrangements" along the lines of an agreed policy to curb trading which uses privileged information.     the channel islands and the isle of man are constitutionally independent of britain's parliament, and have fiscal regimes sympathetic to business and the accumulation of capital.  reuter &#3;</h3>
