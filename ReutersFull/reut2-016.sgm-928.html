	<h3>u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter said he was almost sure japan would not retaliate against tariffs president reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of japanese electronic goods today.     "i'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will not provoke a retaliation on american products," yeutter told cable news network.     "japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with the united states) to seriously entertain thoughts of retaliation," yeutter said.     earlier today, reagan  imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of japanese goods in retaliation for japan's alleged violation of a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.     yeutter did say that u.s. farm products would be targeted if tokyo decided to hit back.     "if they (japan) were to retaliate, it would probably be on something like american agricultural products," he said.     "but i really think the chances of that happening are between slim and none," he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
