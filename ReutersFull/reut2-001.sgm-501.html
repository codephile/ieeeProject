	<h3>castle and cooke inc said it would take a fourth quarter after-tax loss of 33.9 mln dlrs from the previously reported sale of its flexi-van container leasing business to itel corp <itel> for about 215 mln dlrs.     earlier, the company reported a loss for the fourth quarter ended january 3 of 31.9 mln dlrs, or 76 cts a share, compared with a loss of 3.3 mln dlrs, or 21 cts per share, in 1985's fourth quarter.     for the year, however, the diversified holding company reported a net profit of 43.9 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, versus 46.4 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, in 1985.     david murdock, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "both our food business and our real estate operations increased their earnings during the year (1986)."     but, he added that flexi-van's 1986 results were hit by depressed daily rental rates for leased equipment caused by oversupplies.     the company also reported that george elkas, formerly executive vice president,  has been named president and chief operating officer of flexi-van corp, while william burns has been named executive vice president of flexi-van.  reuter &#3;</h3>
