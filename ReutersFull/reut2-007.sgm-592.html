	<h3>klm royal dutch airways <klm.as> said it agreed to take full control of a partially owned dutch-based parcel delivery service and will offer a minority stake in it to british and commonwealth shipping plc <bcom.l>     klm, seeking to strengthen its market position in the fast growing door-to-door delivery market, said it agreed with dutch retailer vendex international <venn.as> to take over vendex's 50-pct in their jointly-owned courier, <xp system vof>.     ownership of xp will now be brought into the talks started by klm last week with british and commonwealth for a one-third stake in the latter's <iml air services group ltd> courier.     when announcing the negotiations with british and commonwealth last week, klm said buying a minority stake in iml could involve a convertible loan issue.     a klm spokeswoman said the dutch flag carrier would now offer a minority stake in xp to british and commonwealth in the negotiations on iml, but declined to elaborate on financial aspects of the talks.     she said klm would like the two courier services to cooperate in future and did not exclude a future merger between them to combine iml's strong world-wide network with xp's mainly european activities.     xp system is based in the southern dutch airport of maastricht and has an annual turnover of 100 mln guilders.     klm, which is also negotiating with british and commonwealth for a 15-pct stake in the latter's regional airline <air u.k. ltd>, says door-to-door delivery courier services are seeing substantially faster growth than traditional cargo activities.  reuter &#3;</h3>
