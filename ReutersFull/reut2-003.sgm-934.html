	<h3>international business machines corp said it formed a new business group to sell and support telecommunications products.     called the telecommunications marketing and service organization, ibm said the group combines the u.s. direct sales, service and support operations of its rolm corp unit with the marketing support operations of its information systems group.     ibm said the new group is responsible for direct sales, installation and service of the rolm product line as well as other ibm telecommunications products.     ibm acquired rolm, a santa clara, calif.-based maker of telephone swichboards and other telecommunications equipment, in 1984.     analysts in the past have criticized ibm for not moving faster to integrate rolm's telecommunications products with its computer systems.     but edward e. lucente, an ibm vice president and group executive of the information systems group, said in a statement, "this is an important step toward providing a single ibm marketing and service organization to increase our focus on our customers' telecommunications products needs."     ibm said jack w. blumenstein, a rolm vice president and head of its business communications group, will take charge of the new telecommunications organization, which will operate as a unit within the information systems group.     blumenstein was named an assistant group executive of the information systems group and he will report to lucente, ibm said.     ibm said the new organization will oversee the technical and marketing support of rolm and ibm telecommunications products but will not be responsible for sales and marketing of ibm gear.     ibm said rolm will retain responsibility for the worldwide manufacture and development of rolm products. rolm will also continue to direct the sale of its products by rolm distributors in the united states and overseas.     at the same time, ibm said its communications products division will continue to direct the worldwide development and u.s. manufacture of ibm's non-rolm telecommunications products.     dennis d. paboojian, rolm's president, will continue to report to ibm senior vice president allen j. krowe, ibm said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
