	<h3>cbt wheat futures opened firmer to again set new contract highs in new crop, then back off those highs to hold gains of 1-1/4 cents per bushel in may, with new crop july unchanged in light early dealings.     steady speculative buying after yesterday's strong close kept the chart picture very bullish and supported initial values, traders said.     rumors that exporters are planning to ship srw wheat out of toledo and/or chicago, further tightening already low deliverable stocks, kept may firm relative to new crop months, they added.     however, the rally failed to follow-through due to the lack of confirmed export sales of significant quantities of u.s. wheat so far this week, as some traders expected.   reuter &#3;</h3>
