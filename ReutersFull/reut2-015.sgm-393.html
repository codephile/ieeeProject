	<h3>the maximum export rebate granted at yesterday's ec sugar tender marked no change in policy over producer complaints that they are not obtaining the ec intervention price in exporting sugar outside the community, ec commission sources said.     the maximum rebate was 46.496 ecus per 100 kilos for 118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 ecus the previous week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.     producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 ecu short the previous week, the sources said.     they said this was despite the fact that the commission had to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low.     operators have now until early may to withdraw this sugar. but they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless the commission reviews its export policy, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
