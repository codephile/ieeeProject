	<h3>malaysia is to urge fellow tin producing countries to contribute more money towards research into new uses for the metal, malaysian primary industries minister lim keng yaik told reuters in an interview.     lim, in brussels on a tour of europe and america, said he had instructed malaysia's representatives on the executive committee of the association of tin producing countries, atpc, to draw up a paper on the matter.     lim earlier met european community farm commissioner frans andriessen and industry commissioner karl-heinz narjes.     he said though it now appeared likely commission proposals for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be defeated, he feared the commission would revive the idea.     lim noted andriessen this week promised that if the tax was adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result, they would be compensated through access to the ec for alternative exports.     "since most of our products are commodity based, i cannot see how this would work out in our case," lim said.     malaysian palm oil exports to the ec are worth about 250 mln dlrs a year.     the tin research proposal would be presented at an atpc meeting to be held in kuala lumpur in september.     "not enough research and development effort has been put in by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes such as aluminium, paper and plastics," lim said.     he mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an exciting possible new application.     lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the new paper was produced.     he said narjes told him there appeared no fundamental barriers to ec states quickly ratifying the new international rubber agreement, inra, although translations of the accord into some ec languages are still being awaited.     lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on malaysia's behalf when he visits new york during his current tour, said it was important there should not be a long "interregnum" between the old agreement lapsing in october and the new one coming into force.     he described the present accord as a model for commodity agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and control over buffer stock management.  reuter &#3;</h3>
