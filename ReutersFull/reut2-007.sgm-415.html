	<h3>the opec fund for international development approved 100,000 dlrs in aid for ecuador, which was struck recently by an earthquake.     the fund, which was set up by the 13 opec (organization of petroleum exporting countries) member states to help third world development, said in a statement the money would be used to provide medical supplies for the earthquake victims.     ecuador, itself a member of opec, suffered a major blow to its economy when the earthquake damaged a pipeline carrying crude oil, its chief export earner.  reuter &#3;</h3>
