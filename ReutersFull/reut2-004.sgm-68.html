	<h3>guinness plc <guin.l> , the brewing group, has challenged a 5.2 mln stg payment to a u.s. lawyer who says he organised its controversial takeover of scotch whisky maker <the distillers co plc>.     but attorneys for lawyer thomas ward, a member of the guinness board, told a court yesterday in the channel island of jersey that ward saw the payment as his reward for services in last year's 2.7 billion stg takeover.     britain's department of trade and industry is investigating the takeover.     guinness says its former chairman ernest saunders and ward "breached their fiduciary duty" in authorising the payment to ward, via a jersey-based company, marketing and acquisitions consultants and has gone to the jersey court to recover it.     mac said in defence documents that ward was the main negotiator in the battle for distillers against rival bidder argyll <ayll.l> group plc.     "the bid would not have been successful but for the ... services of mr ward," mac attorneys said in the documents submitted in court. "the payment was, in all the circumstances, reasonable, proper and fully earned."  reuter &#3;</h3>
