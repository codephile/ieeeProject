	<h3>agriculture secretary richard lyng said the export enhancement program (eep) could be funded from the commodity credit corporation (ccc) if the one billion dlrs appropriated for export bonus by congress is exhausted.     lyng told reporters lack of funding should not be a constraint on the program because usda has the authority to use ccc funds to continue the program. he noted congress authorized up to 1.5 billion dlrs for eep.     earlier this week, leo mayer, associate administrator of usda's foreign agricultural service, said 865 mln dlrs of the one billion in appropriated funds for eep have been used. usda officials said if all the eep offers announced are accepted by importing countries the one billion dlrs would be exhausted soon.     some congressional sources have expressed concern that the office of management and budget (omb) might try to block usda from seeking more than the one billion dlrs appropriated for the program.     these sources suggested the lack of funds might force usda to halt the program, which some commodity groups believe has given a boost to u.s. exports of some farm products, particularly wheat and wheat flour.     however, lyng's comments seemed to suggest that usda could at least temporarily continue the program using ccc funds and would not be forced to curtail eep.  reuter &#3;</h3>
