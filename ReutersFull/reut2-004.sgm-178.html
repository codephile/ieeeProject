	<h3>jamaica has put a cap on its 3.5 billion dlr foreign debt and will reduce its obligations by 300 mln dlrs this year, prime minister edward seaga said.     seaga yesterday said jamaica has reached its "maximum stock of debt" and will not undertake any more borrowing until it was justified by economic growth. "this year we'll be reducing the stock of debt by 300 mln dlrs," he said.     he said his government aims to get jamaica's ratio of debt payments to foreign exchange earnings down from the current level of 50 pct to 25 pct over the next two to three years. debt payments this year are expected to total 287 mln dlrs, seaga said. seaga yesterday concluded an agreement with jamaica's creditor banks to reschedule some 181 mln dlrs due in 1987-89 over the next 12 years.  reuter &#3;</h3>
