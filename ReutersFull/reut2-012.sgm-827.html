	<h3>finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said he will advise brazil to take up discussions with its commercial bank creditors when he is in washington for the international monetary fund (imf) meeting next week.     he told a news conference ahead of the imf talks that discussions about developing country debt problems would play an important role on the agenda in washington.     stoltenberg noted that brazil had agreed in january to work together with the banks but said this pledge had not yet been fulfilled.     after brazil imposed a moratorium on interest payments on 68 billion dlrs worth of debt in february, brazilian finance minister dilson funaro sought to involve foreign governments in rescheduling talks with banks.     but british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson rebuffed funaro's bid and said commercial bank loans were a matter for banks and not governments. west german bankers also said then that brazil should seek an understanding with the imf.     stoltenberg said in bonn today that he had already told funaro that the unilateral moratorium was a mistake.     stoltenberg said that despite progress in some areas, the debt problems of a whole range of countries had recently become more difficult.     he said flows from commercial banks had decreased markedly and that the refusal of some highly indebted countries to fulfil their commitments to private creditors or with the imf was one reason for this.     he also said that when debtor countries came up with good, confidence-inspiring policies, commercial banks should react with more flexibility in interest structures, maturities and rescheduling.    many debtor countries had realised that it was not possible to mobilise capital flows, and especially direct investments, without such policies, stoltenberg said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
