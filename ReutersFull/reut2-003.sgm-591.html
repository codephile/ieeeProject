	<h3>triton energy corp said its 70 pct owned <canadian worldwide energy ltd> affiliate's lasmo et al tableland 4-36-2-10w2 well in saskatchewan flowed 567 barrels of 37 degree gravity oil through a 17/64 inch choke from depths of 8,531 to 8,548 feet and 636 barrels of oil per day through a 20/64 inch choke from depths of 8,500 to 8,507 feet.     triton said because of the well's status as a deep exploratory well, production qualifies for a five-year royalty holiday under the saskatchewan drilling incentive products.     it said the well's initial production is expected to be restricted to an allowable level of about 300 barrels a day, although it is capable of sustaining much higher rates.     the company said london and scottish marine oil plc owns a 50 pct interest in the well and its spacing unit, canadian worldwide 25 pct, <saskatchewan oil and gas corp> 10 pct, <interprovincial pipeline ltd's> home oil co ltd 7.5 pct and scurry-rainbow oil ltd <srb> 7.5 pct.     triton said royal dutch/shell group's <rd> <sc> shell canada ltd <shc> affiliate retains a convertible overriding interest in the well.  reuter &#3;</h3>
