	<h3>paul volcker's resignation as federal reserve board chairman creates a serious leadership vacuum at a time of deep uncertainty about the future management of the third-world debt crisis, bankers said.     they said volcker did more than any other official to hold the financial system together when mexico halted interest payments in august 1982 and has played a central role ever since.     "where is the leadership going to come from? suddenly there's a terrible void," one new york banker said.     volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missed because international monetary fund managing director michel camdessus is new to his job and barber conable is finding it hard to make a mark as world bank president, bankers said.     moreover, volcker's successor, alan greenspan, has little experience of international affairs and third world debt.     "greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issues and the sense of understanding of their complexity that volcker has. volcker understands what motivates people outside the u.s. that was in his gut. greenspan just does not have the intuitive feeling," one banker said.     this banker, who has discussed debt questions with greenspan, described his views as simplistic.     but robert hormats of goldman, sachs and co said he was not worried by greenspan's lack of international experience.     "people rush to judgment, but once they get to know greenspan i'm sure they'll find him an excellent replacement," said hormats, a former administration official.     anyone nominated to replace volcker would have paled in the initial comparison, hormats said. "volcker had the status of a financial demigod and you can't attain that status overnight," he said.     one veteran debt rescheduler said volcker, together with the bank of england, deserves credit for keeping the banking system intact after mexico's default.     "if it hadn't been for him, the world would look a lot different now," he said. "whether you agreed with him or not, he has a superb grasp of ideas."     certainly, not all bankers did agree all the time with volcker. in particular, he was roundly criticized by some for more or less forcing them last september to grant mexico generous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debt rescheduling agreement.     "volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping the bounds and pushing the package onto the banks," commented one banker who helped to negotiate the mexican deal.     another critic was citicorp chairman john reed, who said the 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders and thus delay mexico's return to the voluntary markets.     it was a review of the fate of the mexican deal - and of others that followed it for chile, venezuela, the philippines and argentina - that helped to convince reed that the debt crisis was not about to be solved and that citicorp needed to bolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.     "it certainly contributed to the general feeling of malaise," one citicorp banker said in describing the impact of the mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billion dlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses.     that decision, since followed by chase manhattan and security pacific corp, may profoundly alter the strategy of creditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis.     but no one is sure what the impact will be. "it's very difficult for anyone to know which way the debt problem is going, and with volcker out of the picture it just adds to the uncertainty," one banker said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
