	<h3>japanese creditor banks are close to a decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable debts owed by developing nations, international financial sources told reuters.     details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the firm set up before the end of the month, they said.     the scheme is intended to improve financial management at the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts turning bad, the sources said.     last week's announcement by brazil that it would indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted japanese creditors to finalise the project, the sources said.     major japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid a debt crisis since the start of the year, they said.     there are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, and perhaps as many as 28, they said.     about 30 japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans totalling over 10 billion dlrs to brazil, accounting for about 15 pct of all commercial loans to that country.     the most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the caribbean tax haven of the cayman islands, the sources said.     the idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock.     the firm will then use the funds to buy from its stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign loans which are potentially bad, the sources said.     the stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans.     subject to the scheme would be loans extended to debt-ridden countries such as mexico and argentina, they said.     the financial sources said interest payments to the firm would not be taxed because of its location. japanese banks have asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss reserves, but the ministry has not yet complied.     a senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it may encourage new lending to developing countries.     the ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled countries, but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting for one pct of the loans.  reuter &#3;</h3>
