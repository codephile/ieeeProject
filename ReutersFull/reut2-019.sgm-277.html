	<h3>the world bank said it approved loans to jamaica totalling 104 mln dlrs to assist it with an economic structural adjustment program, a sugar industry rehabilitation scheme and a population and health project.     the bank said two loans will support jamaica's structural adjustment program -- a 40 mln dlr loan for the trade and financial sector and a 20 mln dlr loan for the public enterprise sector.     the bank said a 34 mln dlr loan is to help jamaica's sugar industry become self-sufficient and meet both domestic demand and the export demand of the united states and european community.     the fourth loan, for 10 mln dlrs, is to improve family planning programs and health care.  reuter &#3;</h3>
