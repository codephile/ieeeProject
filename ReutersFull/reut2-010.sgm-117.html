	<h3>debt securities of major u.s. banks came under light selling pressure in secondary trading on the heels of standard and poor's corp's downgrade of six money center banks late yesterday, analysts and traders said.     but they described market response as muted because the s and p action came as no surprise. besides, many participants had already shied away from bank issues following brazil's suspension of interest payments last month, traders added.     "the downgrades were expected for some time. in fact, you can argue that s and p is lagging the market," commented one trader.     on february 20, brazil said it would suspend interest payments on about 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercial banks. no date was established for the renewal of payments.     in its action, standard and poor's cited the exposure to major latin american debtor countries of chase manhattan corp <cmb>, chemical new york corp <chl>, irving bank corp <v> and manufacturers hanover corp <mhc>.     the rating agency also downgraded mellon financial corp <mel> and security pacific  corp <spc>, but said this reflected higher non-performing assets and weaker operating results rather than the international debt problem.     "the s and p downgrades were a non-event," a trader said. "anyone who was caught unaware was not on top of the situation anyway."     said another trader, "people talked about this before and after s and p's announcement. there was not much reaction among bank issues today, though prices are still below par."     still, market watchers said the action further undermined sentiment for bank paper.     because of brazil's suspension of interest payments, u.s. bank paper has underperformed such other sectors as utilities, telephones and industrials, analysts pointed out.     even though standard and poor's affirmed the debt ratings of citicorp <cci>, bankers trust new york <bt>, bank of boston corp <bkb> and j.p. morgan and co inc <jpm>, few buyers can be found for securities issued by those banks, traders said.     "let's face it. investors believe these banks are also exposed to latin and other debtor countries. and investors buy on perceptions," said one broker.     about the only bright spots in an otherwise dull banking sector of the secondary corporate market are u.s. regional banks and japanese banks because investors perceive them as less exposed to the debtor nations, analysts pointed out.  reuter &#3;</h3>
