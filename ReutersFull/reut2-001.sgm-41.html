	<h3>bangor hydro-electric cor said it has filed with the maine public utilities commission (mpuc) for a two-stage base rate reduction.     bangor hydro said the first stage, which could take effect on april 1 and would stay effective until the mpuc makes a final decision on the filing, could cut revenues by 6.149 mln dlrs, or 9.7 pct.     the company said lower federal income taxes and lower capital costs prompted the filing.     the second stage, bangor hydro said, effective when the mpuc makes a final decision, calls for an additional revenue reduction of 712,000 dlrs, or 1.1 pct.     bangor hydro said, if approved, the cuts would reduce residential base rates by 8.5 pct, with 7.5 pct cut by april 1.     the utility company also said it is seeking to increase its fuel cost adjustment rate by april 1.     bangor said if the increase is approved it could offset much of the base rate cut and may cause a net increase in some customers' rates.  reuter &#3;</h3>
