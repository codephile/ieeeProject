	<h3>the coffee, sugar and cocoa exchange has expanded the normal daily trading limit in coffee "c" contracts to 6.0 cents a lb, from the previous 4.0 cents, effective today, the csce said.     the new daily limits apply to all but the two nearby positions, currently may and july, which trade without limits.     in addition, the 6.0 cent limit can be increased to 9.0 cents a lb if the first two limited months both make limit moves in the same direction for two consecutive sessions, according to the csce announcement.     before the rule change today, the csce required two days of limit moves in the first three restricted contracts before expanding the daily trading limit.     under new guidelines, if the first two restricted deliveries move the 6.0 cent limit for two days the exchange will expand the limit. the expanded 9.0 cent limit will remain in effect until the settling prices on both of the first two limited months has not moved by more than the normal 6.0 cent limit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions, the csce said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
