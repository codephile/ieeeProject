	<h3>japan's trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987, as sales of japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) said.     in its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the oecd said japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct.     but it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988, "thus weakening the international adjustment process."     it forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct in 1988. as a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.     the oecd outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to japan. however, oecd officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite possibly exceeding one pct gnp when the full effects have worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.     the oecd outlook said, "continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen." it said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth.     the oecd said japan's gross national product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct growth. but it said japan would continue its good performance on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
