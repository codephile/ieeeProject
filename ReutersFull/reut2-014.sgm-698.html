	<h3>u.s. stock index futures dropped in  active late afternoon trade and closed near daily lows.     the selloff followed an early rally that had sent june s and p 500s to a new contract high of 306.10. arbitrage buy programs were triggered when the june s and p reached a 3.20 point premium over the spot index, traders said.     however, weakness in the bond market in afternoon trade sparked selling in june s and ps, sending the nearby contract to a discount which triggered the unwinding of buy programs, traders said. june s and ps fell through chart support at 296.00 which also sparked technical selling.     value line futures closed down 6.85 to 7.00, s and p 500 futures fell 7.65 to 7.85, nyse futures dropped 4.60, and mmi futures ended 10.65 to 11.00 points lower.   reuter &#3;</h3>
