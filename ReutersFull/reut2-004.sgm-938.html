	<h3>the soviet union has been a heavy buyer of yugoslav corn since october, purchasing close to 1.5 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report from the u.s. agriculture counselor in belgrade.     approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this sold to the soviet union, the yugoslav grain association reported to the u.s. official.     in a report dated march 10, the official said that about 800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and june.     an additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from july-september, the grain associaiton said, so total yugoslav corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.     heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the soviet union, the counselor said.     monthly corn shipments out of yugoslavia have averaged around 160,000 tonnes since october 1, higher than earlier estimates of 150,000, the official said.     the soviet union has taken an increased share of yugoslav corn sales during this marketing year, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
