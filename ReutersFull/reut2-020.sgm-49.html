	<h3>president corazon aquino said economic growth took priority over debt repayments but she sought to dispel fears that the philippines would not honour a july agreement rescheduling 13.2 billion dlrs of debt.     in a speech to 13 major business groups, aquino said, "our policy has been very clear fm the start -- growth must take priority, for the plain and simple reason that if we have no money to pay, we can't. and if we starve the nation of essential services, there may be no one around to honour the debt."     aquino said her officials would try to get all 483 creditor banks to sign the debt rescheduling pact by the november 15 effective date.     "that should end speculation and remove at least one excuse for hoarding dollars," aquino said.     violent fluctuations in the peso's exchange rate and the end of a 17-month bull run in local stock markets have triggered dollar-hoarding.     aquino said the country's foreign debt, which rose to nearly 29 billion dlrs in april, was growing even without fresh borrowing.     debt servicing took up 40 pct of the budget and 45 pct of export earnings, aquino said. over the next six years, the philippines would be paying its creditors 20 billion dlrs while getting only four billion dlrs in new loans.     aquino acknowledged there were grave doubts about her government's ambitious privatisation program.     "there is always an excuse for government not to sell," she said, but she added: "i want government to get out of business." she said non-performing assets would be sold in open bidding and filipinos and foreigners would compete on equal terms.  reuter &#3;</h3>
