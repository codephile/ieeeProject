	<h3>the commerce department on monday will set final dumping duties on frozen orange juice from brazil, department officials said.     a preliminary duty of 8.54 pct was set last oct 17 on the imports, which run at about 700 mln dlrs a year. commerce's ruling on monday will reset the duties on the basis of more detailed cost information, industry officials said.     the duties now are being assessed on a temporary basis, pending a final ruling by the u.s. international trade commission (itc) on whether the imports are injuring the domestic orange industry.     the itc ruled provisionally last june 18 that the domestic industry was being injured by brazilian orange juice imports.     a complaint that the brazilian imports were being dumped at below costs on the u.s. market was filed on behalf of u.s. growers by the florida citrus mutual, a lakeland, fla., group, alcoma packing co, inc, and barry citrus products.     u.s. officials say about half of the orange juice consumed in the united states comes from brazil.  reuter &#3;</h3>
