	<h3>the federal communications commission voted at a meeting to ease a requirement that cable television firms must provide a signal-selector switch free of charge to all customers.     the so-called a/b switch is attached to a television set and permits a viewer to turn from cable programs to over-the-air broadcast stations which cable companies must carry.     after the rule was criticized the fcc changed it so that cable firms would have to provide the switch only if a customer requested it and could charge a fee.  reuter &#3;</h3>
