	<h3>the intensive technology concept for grain production has put a new floor under ussr grain production, the u.s. agriculture department's officer in moscow said in a field report.     the report, quoting a broadcast on radio moscow, said that due to intensive technology grain production in a "bad year" will not fall below 200 mln tonnes, and in a "good year" grain production could reach 250 mln tonnes.     the u.s. agriculture department currently forecasts this year's ussr crop at 210.1 mln tonnes, and if realized this would be the third year since 1975 that the soviet union's grain harvest has exceeded 200.0 mln tonnes.     the largest crop since 1975 was 237.4 mln tonnes harvested in 1978, according to usda data.  reuter &#3;</h3>
