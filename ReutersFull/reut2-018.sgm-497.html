	<h3>a forecast 379 mln n.z. dlr surplus in the government's 1987/88 budget will allow a significant reduction in the government debt program, finance minister roger douglas said in a statement.     "there are however good reasons to maintain a higher borrowing program than the budget numbers require," he said.     the government will borrow a further 950 mln dlrs this fiscal year, down from the further 1.75 billion originally planned.     "the amount of foreign currency debt generated by previous economic mismanagement is too large," douglas said. "it would not be sensible when presented with an opportunity to repay some debt to do so only in respect of domestic debt."     the government also has an interest in keeping enough of a domestic borrowing program going to keep the secondary market efficient, he said. that will give the government better borrowing terms in future, he added.     douglas said the revised debt program also meant the government would be able to retire over 650 mln dlrs of domestic debt and 600 mln dlrs of foreign debt.  reuter &#3;</h3>
