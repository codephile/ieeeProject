	<h3>the international cocoa organization (icco) council adjourned after agreeing buffer stock rules for the 1986 international cocoa agreement, an icco spokesman said.     the buffer stock will begin operations immediately, he said.     he confirmed delegate reports that the buffer stock manager will trade cocoa by means of an offer system, and according to fixed differentials for cocoa from different origins.     purchases from non-members will be limited to 15 pct of the total and buying or selling operations in any one day will be restricted to a maximum of 40 pct each for nearby, intermediate and forward positions, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
