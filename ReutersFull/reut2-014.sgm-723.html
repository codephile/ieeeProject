"investors threw in the towel today. the long bond seems headed for eight pct within the next few days," a trader said. that would correspond to a price of about 94-3/8.     treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points. notes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4.     bond traders said the main negative is recent instability of the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted central bank support will not prevent a further drop in the dollar.  reuter &#3;</h3>
