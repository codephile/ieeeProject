	<h3>opec produced an average 16.1 mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in february, down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986, the international energy agency said.     a few opec countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in december, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report.     these cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to fixed prices, introduced from february 1, particularly for fixed volumes over an extended period.     it gave this breakdown for opec crude output, in mln bpd                     fourth qtr 1986  january 1987  february 1987     saudi arabia    4.9              3.7           3.8     iran            1.6              2.2           1.9     iraq            1.6              1.6           1.7     uae             1.3              1.2           1.2     kuwait          1.0              1.0           1.0     neutral zone    0.5              0.4           0.4     qatar           0.3              0.3           0.2     nigeria         1.3              1.2           1.2     libya           1.0              1.0           1.0                     fourth qtr 1986  january 1987  february 1987     algeria         0.6              0.6           0.6     gabon           0.1              0.2           0.2     venezuela       1.6              1.6           1.6     ecuador         0.2              0.2           0.2     indonesia       1.3              1.2           1.2     total           17.3             16.5          16.1     the iea said while saudi production stayed below its quota of 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to norbec stock disposals. contracts for saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings.     the report said the reduction in iraqi air attacks on iranian export facilities allowed iran's output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in january, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut february production.     it said iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the saudi pipeline to yanbu. internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.     the iea estimated total non-communist world oil supply in february at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in january and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.     the february world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd opec crude production, 1.4 mln bpd opec natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd oecd crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.     within the oecd, preliminary norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in january, with lower production expected in february in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of opec.  reuter &#3;</h3>
