	<h3>the sixth international tin agreement, ita, has been extended for two years from july 1, 1987, the international tin council, itc, said.     the extension was formally agreed at a resumed special session of the council held here this morning and follows a session early this month when the council agreed in principle to extend the pact but had to await the formal approval of some member governments.     the extension will enable the council to continue with its statistical work and studies of the tin industry.  reuter &#3;</h3>
