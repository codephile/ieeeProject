	<h3>finance minister mark eyskens is proposing a package of personal income tax cuts worth 102.1 billion francs that would apply from 1989, a finance ministry spokesman said.     the package, one of 11 possible tax reform scenarios drawn up by government officials, is expected to be discussed by ministers in the coming weeks so that a government draft can be presented to parliament in october.     the proposals, which would greatly simplify the country's tax system, include a cut in withholding tax on investment income earned in belgium to 20 pct from the current 25 pct.     the reduction would apply to income from risk capital, but the spokesman said this was likely to be defined to include all shares and bonds.     the package chosen by eyskens is more favourable to families with children than the present regime and would treat spouses' incomes separately instead of combining them, a practice that is widely seen as discouraging marriage. the tax reform does not encompass corporate taxation.     the spokesman said some 75 pct of the cost of the package would be financed by changes to the 258 tax allowances currently granted to diverse interest groups.     a further 14 pct would be met by higher tax revenues resulting from the overall macro-economic benefits of the package.     this would leave a shortfall of around 20 billion francs, which the government would have to decide how to cover, either by raising indirect taxes or by making further budgetary cuts.     the package favoured by eyskens, who has described belgium as a "fiscal himalaya," is the least costly of the 11 scenarios prepared. it envisages three marginal rates, or tax thresholds, of 30 pct, 40 pct and 50 pct. this compares with 13 currently, of which the highest is 71.6 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
