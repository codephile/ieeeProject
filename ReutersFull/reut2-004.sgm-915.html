	<h3>antonio ortiz mena, president of the inter-american development bank, warned that if latin countries were unable to speed up their economic growth, then in the long run there would be a default.     he told a press conference foreshadowing the bank's annual meeting next week, "for the banks it is convenient to be repaid. but to achieve that, the countries need to grow. if they don't, then in the long run there will be a default."     ortiz mena warned that latin america needed to reverse the capital outflows from the region and beyond that needed more resources.     ortiz mena declined to agree with estimates that capital outflows from latin america last year totaled 35 billion dlrs and that therefore he was calling for an inflow into the region above that sum.     he said the u.s. debt strategy, which envisaged stepped up lending by commercial and multilateral banks to major debtor nations of 29 billion dlrs over three years, was insufficient to achieve the necessary rates of growth.     but he did stress the u.s. plan was important and the right approach.     ortiz mena said, "it is in the interest of the creditors, not only the debtors, to push forward the development process in latin america and that has happened."     he added, "the only problem is the resources have not been enough."     turning to brazil, whose growth rate he predicted will decline slightly this year from 1986, ortiz mena said the country's moratorium was the right action in order to avert a long term default.     "so it's preferable they negotiate now," a move which would eliminate any chance of panic in the markets.     ortiz mena also said that brazilian authorities have opened negotiations already with commercial banks.     he pointed out brazil took the action because of its deteriorating economic situation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
