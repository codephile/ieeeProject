	<h3>the international development association (ida) is lending 18.6 mln dlrs to sri lanka for agricultural research and development, the world bank said in a statement.     the loan is part of a 26.5 mln dlr project to improve production of commodities, mainly rice, and raise farmer incomes. other financing for the project will come from sri lanka (7.1 mln dlrs) and west germany (800,000 dlrs).     the ida credit is interest-free and for 50 years. it includes a 10-year grace period but has annual charges of 0.5 pct on the undisbursed balance, and 0.75 pct on the disbursed balance, the bank statement said.     the project envisages the creation of a council of agricultural research to formulate a national agricultural strategy and introduce a contract research programme to finance research activities, the bank said.     the washington-based ida is the world bank's affiliate for concessionary lending.  reuter &#3;</h3>
