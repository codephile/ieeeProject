	<h3>university federal savings bank said its board authorized the bank to apply to change its present federal charter to a washington state charter.     the company said it also will seek to change its depositor insurance coverage from the federal savings and loan insurance corp to the federal deposit insurance corp.     its board believes the broader banking powers available to state-chartered institutions will better serve the long-term objectives of the bank and will be in the best interest of shareholders, university federal also said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
