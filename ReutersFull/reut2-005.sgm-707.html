	<h3>mcdermott international inc said the purchase of a 5.4 pct block of its stock was an apparent violation of the laws of panama, its country of incorporation.     the company said a detailed disclosure of an acquisition offer must be made to the panamanian national securities commission or to the target's board before acquiring more than five pct stake.     it said transfers of securities in violation of these panamanian regulations are invalid.     the company was not immediately available to say who had acquired the 5.4 pct block of stock.  reuter &#3;</h3>
