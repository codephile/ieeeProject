	<h3>federal reserve board member robert heller said the trend toward global financial markets required that all participants be treated even-handedly on such matters as bank capital requirements.     the recent u.s.-u.k. agreement on capital adequacy provided a model for others, including japan, heller told a georgetown university conference on financial markets.     "if they (the japanese bank) want to do more business in europe or the united states they have got to adhere to international standards," he said.     heller said there were talks currently between the united states and japan on bank rules.     he said the trend toward internationalization in financial services would cause markets to move to centers with the least regulation.     "that is not desirable.  we want to have a sensible amount of regulation," heller said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
