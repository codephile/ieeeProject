	<h3>the ministry of international trade and industry (miti) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand outlook by august to meet a forecast downtrend in japanese energy demand, ministry officials said.     miti is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said.     the decision follows the emergence of structural changes in japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand.     miti is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the agency of natural resources and energy, the officials said.     they said miti will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.     nuclear energy provided the bulk of japan's electric power in the fiscal year ended march 31, supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.  reuter &#3;</h3>
