	<h3>the commerce department said all canadian firms have begun to pay an agreed 15 pct surcharge on softwood shipped to u.s. markets.     it made the statement after talks with canadian officials about rumors in canada that some exporters were not paying the charge.     canada and the u.s. agreed last december to the 15 pct charge, ending a lengthy trade dispute over alleged canadian subsidies to canada's softwood exporters.     commerce officials declined to say if any canadian companies had been evading the charge, but said following the talks they were convinced all exporters were complying with the agreement.     undersecretary of commerce bruce smart said "we are gratified to learn that companies in canada have begun paying the export charge on lumber."     he added the agreement was important to the health of the u.s. lumber industry and he intended to see that it was fully carried out.  reuter &#3;</h3>
