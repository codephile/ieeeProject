	<h3>the european community (ec) will not issue a joint statement on the u.s. attack on iran for now, diplomats said.     they said the latest events in the gulf were discussed only briefly by foreign ministers over lunch, though member states had been informed by washington that it was planning military action. "they didn't have enough information to discuss it fully and they wouldn't have agreed anyway," one diplomat said.     belgian foreign minister leo tindemans said belgium had always opposed an extension of violence in the gulf and deeply regretted that the situation had deteriorated.     but british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said the united states was fully entitled to take military action and francisco fernandez ordonez of spain said the u.s. strike could be considered an af self-defence.  reuter &#3;</h3>
