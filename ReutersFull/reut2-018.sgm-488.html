	<h3>the australian government has given support in principle to the production of platinum and silver bullion coins at the perth mint, treasurer paul keating said.     this followed the success of the australian nugget gold bullion coins launched this year, he said in a statement.     he said that, as with the australian nuggets, the coins would be legal tender. the platinum coins would be made in four weights but the silver coin would be of one ounce weight.     he said detailed arrangements for their issue would be finalised after talks between the federal authorities and the western australian government, owner of the perth mint.  reuter &#3;</h3>
