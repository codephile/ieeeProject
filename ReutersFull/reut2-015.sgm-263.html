	<h3><teck corp> said it was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at highland valley, british columbia, held by affiliates cominco ltd <clt> and <lornex mining corp>, but did not know when negotiations would be completed.     teck vice-president of administration john guminski said in reply to a query that the talks had been "ongoing for a long time." he declined to speculate on the outcome.     cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by teck, is optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman don townson told reuters.     "i think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be resolved," cominco's townson said.     "we're optimistic that they will be concluded shortly," he added. townson declined to specify when the talks might end.     cominco and teck's 22 pct-owned lornex agreed in january 1986 to form the joint venture, merging their highland valley copper operations.     cominco and lornex share equally in control and management of the highland valley operations, while cominco has a 55 pct share of production and lornex receives 45 pct.     for the six months following july 1, 1986, when the venture officially started production, highland valley had total ore milled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pct copper, townson said.     cominco's share of production was 43,000 short tons of copper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of molybdenum in concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of gold, he said.     a consortium, 50 pct owned by teck and 25 pct each by mim (canada) inc and metallgesellschaft canada ltd, acquired its cominco stake last year from canadian pacific ltd <cp>.  reuter &#3;</h3>
