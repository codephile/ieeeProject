	<h3><bank of montreal> is confident a solution will be found to brazil's foreign debt problem and is not considering declaring its brazilian loans non-performing, president grant reuber said.     speaking to reporters after a speech to a toronto business group, reuber said: "i think at this stage it is really too early to say very much about (the brazilian debt situation) but we're pretty confident that things will work out."     he declined to comment on when such a settlement was likely. bank of montreal had 1.98 billion dlrs in loans to brazil as of last september 30, the most of any canadian bank.      brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion u.s. dlr foreign bank debt.      asked if bank of montreal were considering declaring its brazil loans non-performing, reuber replied: "we haven't really got to that point because we don't think we will have to face that issue."     some bankers in the u.s. said earlier this week that slow progress in talks between brazil and its major foreign lenders has increased the likelihood that u.s. banks will declare their brazil loans non-performing at the end of the quarter.      reuber told reporters the bank was still pondering its strategy regarding possible entry into the securities business after june 30 when banks and other financial institutions will be allowed full participation in the ontario securities industry.     he said price would help determine if the bank formed its own securities unit or acquired an existing investment dealer, adding that asking prices for some dealers seem "fairly high."     asked about plans for wholly owned harris bankcorp inc, of chicago, reuber said harris might consider acquiring more small community banks around chicago.     "in addition, i think we are giving some consideration to the possibility of extension into other states," reuber said of harris, although he added that any such move was unlikely this year.     in his speech, focusing on current free trade talks between the u.s. and canada, reuber said failure to reach a deal would not represent a calamity for canada but could lower canada's standard of living, raise unemployment and reduce the country's world trading influence.  reuter &#3;</h3>
