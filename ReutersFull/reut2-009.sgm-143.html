	<h3>worsening drought conditions in peking may force the authorities to ration water for industry and farming this summer, the new china news agency said.     the agency quoted city officials as saying rainfall last year was 75 millimetres lower than in 1985, and its two main reservoirs are now only one-quarter full.     peking's underground water level is 60 centimetres lower than last year, reducing daily supplies by 50,000 tons.     the officials said daily water supplies in urban peking will fall 160,000 to 260,000 tons short of demand during the hottest days this summer.     they called for stricter control of water consumption and greater recycling of water, adding that there was no hope of alleviating the shortage until a new water mill starts up in one year's time.  reuter &#3;</h3>
