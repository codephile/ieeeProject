	<h3>greek prime minister andreas papandreou expressed "restricted optimism" about a crisis with turkey over disputed oil rights in the aegean sea.     papandreou was speaking to reporters after briefing opposition political leaders on the latest developments in the row as a turkish research ship escorted by warships and combat aircraft headed for the aegean.     he and other political leaders spoke of qualified optimism following a statement by turkish premier turgut ozal last night that the research vessel would not enter disputed waters as previously annnounced unless greek vessels did so.     the prime minister declined to answer reporters' questions about an announcement last night that greece had asked the united states to suspend operations at one of the american military bases here due to the crisis.     but opposition leader constantine mitsotakis told reporters he thought the suspension would be temporary until the crisis is resolved. a u.s. defence department official in washington said the station was still functioning.     communist party leader harilaos florakis said here "the climate is calmer today."     greek newspapers reported that the greek army, navy and air force had been moved to strategic greek islands in the aegean and to the land border with turkey at the evros river.     but there was no official word on military movements apart from a comment by the government spokesman that the greek navy was no longer in port.     the united states, nato and the united nations all called on greece and turkey to exercise restraint.     greek u.n. representative mihalis dounas said in a letter to the secretary-general that the dispute was of a legal nature and could be settled in the international court in the hague.  reuter &#3;</h3>
