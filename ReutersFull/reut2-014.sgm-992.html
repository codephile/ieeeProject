	<h3>mead corp said the outlook for its major paper markets looks strong for the second quarter and augurs well for its earnings in 1987.     "the generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly improved earnings this year," burnell roberts, chairman and chief executive officer said.     earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of 34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or 65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.     in 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.     mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market conditions and improved operations.     "the combination of capital improvement programs and more employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper operations," roberts said.     he added that mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle of the year.     mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
