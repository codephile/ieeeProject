	<h3>with less than a week remaining to enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, agriculture department officials said that final signup will probably exceed last year's level of 85 pct.     enrollment in usda's basic acreage reduction program will likely total close to 90 pct, agricultural stabilization and conservation service, ascs, officials said, with 50 to 70 pct of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid land diversion program.     the signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially ends at the close of the business day on march 30.     usda will release its official signup report around april 15, an official said.     usda personnel in the corn belt states of iowa, illinois, and indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity, an ascs official told reuters.     a surge of acitivity is expected during this final week of signup, the official said.     "a lot of farmers have been dragging their feet because they were anticipating some changes in the program, but that doesn't look very likely now," he said.     to enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, farmers have to set aside 20 pct of the program acreage base, and have the option to idle an additional 15 pct under a paid land diversion program.  reuter &#3;</h3>
