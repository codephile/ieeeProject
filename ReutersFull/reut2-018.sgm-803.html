	<h3>a joint house-senate committee formally approved a 1988 budget plan certain to touch off a battle with president reagan over taxes and defense.     the budget, a compromise of earlier house and senate budgets, was negotiated yesterday by house and senate democratic leaders.     the plan, slated for house action next tuesday, would reduce next year's estimated 171-billion-dlr deficit to about 134 billion dlrs.     it proposes 19 billion dlrs in new taxes next year and cuts reagan's defense mark.  reuter &#3;</h3>
