	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it is keeping 230 mln dlrs of debt of caesars world inc and caesars world finance corp on creditwatch with negative implications.     s and p cited caesars world's proposed recapitalization plan that calls for incurring one billion dlrs of bank and other debt to finance a 25 dlr per share special dividend and the repayment of about 222.5 mln dlrs of existing debt.     it said the plan's terms would violate dividend convenants in the rated debt's indentures and likely force refinancing of those issues. caesars was placed on creditwatch for a possible downgrade march nine following investor martin sosnoff's bid.     sosnoff bid 28 dlrs per share, or 725.2 mln dlrs, for the 86.4 pct of caesars world stock he does not already own, standard and poor's noted.     the rating agency said an increase in sosnoff's offer is possible. if successful, the stock bid would markedly raise caesars world's financial risk and lead to a large drop in net income and cash flow, s and p said.     caesars world currently carries bb senior debt and b-plus subordinated debt. the finance unit's subordinated debt, which is guaranteed by the parent, is rated b-plus.  reuter &#3;</h3>
