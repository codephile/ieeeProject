	<h3>tlx partners, a group led by asher edelman, does not see any problems with its 65 dlr per share bid for telex corp, a shearson lehman official advising the group said.     several other takeover proposals have crumbled following declines in financial markets, leading to speculation that edelman might also drop his offer. telex fell 11 to 34-1/4.     earlier today, carl icahn dropped his bid to take trans world airlines inc <twa> private and dart group corp <darta.o> said it abandoned plans to acquire dayton hudson corp <dh>.     both cited market conditions.     "nothing fundamental has changed with the company. the stock price has changed, but the company hasn't changed so there's no reason for us to change," said daniel good, head of shearson lehman merchant banking.     "things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect that at the time we have to pay for the shares the financing will be in place," good said.     shearson has agreed to provide bridge financing of up to  600 mln dlrs for the edelman group.  reuter &#3;</h3>
