	<h3>avery inc said the company will not show a profit in the next quarter and will probably not show a profit in 1987.     speaking at the annual shareholders meeting, chairman nelson peltz declined to estimate when the company would become profitable.     peltz said uniroyal chemical co, acquired last year, would increase avery's operating earnings but that associated acquisition costs would prevent avery from posting net profits for some time.     at the meeting, stockholders approved an increase in the authorized number of common shares to 200 mln from 15 mln.     in the fiscal year ended may 30, 1986, avery reported a loss of 489,000 dlrs. the company has changed its fiscal year to end sept 30.     the increase in common shares would cover, among other things, the exercise of triangle industries inc's <tri> and drexel burnham lambert inc's warrants issued in relation to avery's 710 mln dlr acquisition of uniroyal chemical late last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
