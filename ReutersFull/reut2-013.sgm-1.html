	<h3>compaq computer corp, ibm's chief rival in the personal computer market, scored a big gain on wall street today. compaq's stock rose 1-3/8 to 32-1/4 on volume of 1.3 mln shares.     "the rationale for the move," one trader said, "is that the damage from the ibm announcement yesterday was less than expected." he said compaq's stock had been under pressure recently because of anticipation of ibm's unveiling of a new line of personal computers.     international business machines <ibm> introduced four new personal computers and more than 100 new peripheral products. but analysts said the new computers, though they do contain a lot of proprietary concepts, will not be as hard to copy as some other pc makers had feared.     "the long range issue here is who wins and who loses in the pc business, and that issue was not resolved yesterday and is unlikely to be decided any time soon," analyst mark stahlman of sanford c. bernstein and co said.     stahlman reaffirmed his recommendation of compaq and apple computer inc <aapl>.     stahlman said "the critical investment question now is who will have a pickup in sales in the near term. we expect to see a strong demand setting for pcs for the rest of this year, and that will boost the revenues for all of the major pc vendors."     "the first quarter was the strongest pc sales period on record for compaq, apple and ibm," stahlman said, "and i don't think the ibm announcement is going to change that trend soon."     "in anticipating the ibm announcement, compaq has made pricing adjustments necessary to compete for its immediate purposes," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
