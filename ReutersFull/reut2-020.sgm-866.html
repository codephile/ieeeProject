	<h3>wall street's biggest one-day drop since 1914 has revived a bitter debate about whether modern investment techniques turn shifts in investor psychology into colossal moves in share prices.     "the market has gotten away from the players," said dudley eppel, vice president-equity trading at donaldson lufkin and jenrette securities corp. he says stock index futures and options have distorted the investment process.     but wall street professionals who work with index futures and options insist the blame is misplaced.     fischer black, head of the trading and arbitrage division at goldman, sachs and co, says so-called program trading strategies involving opposite positions in futures on stock indices and the underlying stocks deserve almost no blame for today's decline. "people have changed their minds about the future of the economy," he said. another strategy, known as portfolio insurance, may have exagerated the decline to a small degree, said black.     eli wachtel of bear, stearns and co was emphatic. "i do not believe the drop was precipitated by portfolio insurance or expanded by program trading."     "the only thing that will stop it in the end is the value investor who comes in and says 'ibm still sells computers', and buys for traditional reasons" said jeffrey miller of miller tabak hirsch and co.     ibm <ibm> fell 31 to 104 as the dow jones industrial average dropped more than 500 points.     several years ago miller's firm was one of the first to pursue program trading strategies, seeking to lock in an automatic profit by taking advantage of discrepancies in the prices of the futures and the underlying stocks. but he said his firm has not been involved in that since late last year.     miller said some investors who were burned in the recent market declines may have miscalculated the effects of portfolio insurance. he estimated 70 to 80 billion dlrs in invested funds prior to the decline were hedged with futures.     the way portfolio insurance is used, miller said, investors at the time they protect their portfolios commit themselves to a future course of action such as buying a put option. while negative news such as trade deficits and budget deficits build for months, the put options tend to be crowded into a narrow span of time, because they are executed as the market starts to fall.     miller said at present people can only guess how much portfolio insurance is in use. he suggested some system of disclosure could put other investors on guard that the seeds were being planted that might add to a future decline.     but in any case miller argued that index futures and options do not initiate market trends.     people like eppel of donaldson, lufkin and jenrette were steadfast in their criticism. "if i had my way there wouldn't be any index futures," he said. "they propelled the market up when nothing was going on and now we're paying the price."     another irate trader, referring to ibm's 31 point drop, complained "what announcement did ibm make over the weekend that made its stock drop 31 points?" ibm was as high as 175-7/8 earlier this year.     some economists agreed that the stock market could be sending signals about the economy.  allen sinai, chief economist for shearson lehman brothers, told reuters the 508 point decline represented "a crisis of confidence.     "this is a a bona-fide financial crisis. the market is showing panic. i suspect there is a wholesale deserting of our markets by a lot of foreign investors."     sinai said the crisis was caused by continuing u.s. budget and trade deficits and by rising interest rates. "this is not a signal of the start of a recession, but a strong indicator that one is coming if nothing is done in washington to deal with the budget and trade deficits," sinai said.     some market participants said redemptions by investors who own mutual funds fueled the decline. but steve norwitz, a spokesman for t. rowe price associates, a baltimore-based investment management firm, said redemptions and switches into money market funds by price's one mln accounts amounted to less than two pct of assets. "it's not a rout by any means."         norwitz said the company normally receives about 3,500 telephone inquiries from its customers each day. on friday, he said, when the dow index fell 108 points the volme of calls rose to around 7,000 and today it exceeded that although he did not have a precise number.     ike kerridge, an economist with the oilfield service firm baker hughes inc., was one of several analysts who said the evaporation of billions of dollars of paper profits could alter consumer behavior.     "this could be the trigger for a national recession which would be very unusual in an election year," kerridge said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
