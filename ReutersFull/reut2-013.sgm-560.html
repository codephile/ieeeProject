	<h3>long debt futures turned easier in late morning on the london international financial futures exchange (liffe) as the dollar and sterling softened, dealers said.     long gilt futures had a good start with an opening range of 124-10/32 to 124-14/32 from 124-7/32 overnight as sentiment was boosted by two opinion polls showing a comfortable lead for the ruling conservatives.     they made a high of 124-19/32 but met chart resistance. a wave of professional sales hit the market at 1000 gmt, driving the price to a low of 124 after minor support at 124-6/32 was breached.     this coincided with a dip in sterling to 72.2 on its trade- weighted index against 72.3 at the start and 72.4 last night.     at the same time, the dollar was dipping below 145 yen after a night of pressure in the far east.     june t-bond futures made lows of 97-18/32 and settled around 97-21/32 at 1015 gmt after opening 8/32 easier at 97-26/32.     analysts said the markets remained cautious because of a series of talks in washington this week between finance ministers of industrial countries.     june eurodollars started at 93.33, a technical support point, and eased to 93.30 or 0.06 below last night.     analysts said sterling contracts would have difficulty advancing beyond current levels if the market discounts the conservative victory predicted by the opinion polls.     other difficulties were sterling's inability to breach the 2.96 mark ceiling, which could indicate the bank of england is trying hard to keep a lid on the u.k. currency.     also, market talk of a further base rate cut has died down, although another cut was virtually discounted by mid-march.     june short sterling futures were little changed in early trading from last night's 90.78 but slipped to a low of 90.73 by late morning. interbank interest rates were unchanged.     june ft-se 100 futures saw an opening range of 204 to 203.70 in line with last night's 203.80 but made a low of 202.20 late morning. the underlying index opened only slightly weaker and losses extended to 11 points by 1030 gmt.     long gilt options featured 465 june calls at 125, 127 at 130 with 118 june puts at 122 and 195 at 126.  reuter &#3;</h3>
