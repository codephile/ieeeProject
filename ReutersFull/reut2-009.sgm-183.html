	<h3>taiwanese investment in the u.s. is expected to nearly double to 80 mln u.s. dlrs in calendar 1987 and rise to 400 mln dlrs a year by 1991, a five-year forecast by the economic ministry showed.     taiwanese investment in the u.s. last year totalled 46 mln dlrs, the ministry document said. the investment was mainly in electronics, trading, food and service industries.     lee ming-yi, deputy director of the ministry's industrial development and investment centre, said the forecast rise is due to planned government incentives and growing willingness among taiwanese to invest abroad.     lee told reuters the incentives, to be introduced in may or june, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the u.s. to 10 mln taiwan dlrs from 20 mln.     he said the moves to encourage investment in the u.s. are part of taiwan's efforts to cut its trade surplus with washington, which rose to a record 13.6 billion u.s. dlrs in 1986 from 1985's 10.2 billion.     taiwanese manufacturers can create jobs for americans and avoid import quotas if they set up plants in the u.s., he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
