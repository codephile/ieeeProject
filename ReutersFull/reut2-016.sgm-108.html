	<h3>bell resources ltd <blla.s> said it will raise about 50.8 mln dlrs by issuing 135.6 mln warrants at 37.5 cents each, entitling the holder to take up shares in bhp gold mines ltd <bhpg.me> at 1.60 dlrs each on or before december 15, 1987.     the non-renounceable entitlement will be on the basis of one-for-three to holders of bell resources fully-paid shares and convertible preference shares registered on may 6, the company said in a statement. other ratios will be one-for-five for partly paid series a shares, one-for-eight for partly-paid series b and c shares and one-for-10 for 1987 options.     bell said the security is similar in concept to the warrants on the shares of bhp gold mine's parent company, the broken hill pty co ltd <brkn.me> (bhp), launched by bell about one year ago.     bhp is currently floating bhp gold mines, the vehicle for its gold interests in australia and other countries.     the bell group ltd will not take up its entitlement to the bhp gold mines warrants, but the family companies of its chairman robert holmes a court will, bell said.     the warrants will be listed and stockbroker mccaughan dyson and co ltd is underwriting the issue.  reuter &#3;</h3>
