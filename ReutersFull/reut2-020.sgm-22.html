	<h3>the finance ministry plans to examine how life insurance companies realised capital gains through transactions undertaken in june, just before the yen bond market began to fall sharply, a senior ministry official said.     the move is aimed at cooling fierce competition in the field and will pave the way for a ministry system to check that insurers do not inflate investment returns on the accounts to attract investors, he said.     some insurers transfer part of their unrealised gains from general accounts to the variable life accounts, violating their internal regulations, industry sources said.     the eight major local life-insurers which offer variable life policies here realised an average return of 21.01 pct on such policies in the year ended september.     the ministry will scrutinise the policies of 17 local and foreign life insurers which offer the variable life schemes.     japan has 23 major local life insurers, none of which is listed on the stock market.   reuter &#3;</h3>
