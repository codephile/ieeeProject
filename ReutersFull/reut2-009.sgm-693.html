	<h3>treasury secretary james baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries.     baker, in an interview on cable news network, was asked about such loans after standard and poor's corp today downgraded the debt of six major money centre bank holding companies, largely because of their heavy loan exposure to developing nations.     baker said developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as that of the united states. he said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in those countries' economic systems.     the money must come either through equity or debt and baker said developing nations' "investment regimes do not support enough equity investment, so you've got to have some debt there."  reuter &#3;</h3>
