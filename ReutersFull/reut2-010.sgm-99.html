	<h3>jorge cardenas, manager of colombia's coffee growers' federation, said he did not believe any important decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting of the international coffee organization (ico).     the ico executive board is set to meet in london from march 31 and could decide to call a special council session by the end of april to discuss export quotas.     "it's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has been happening in the market, but it's unlikely any major decisions are taken," cardenas told journalists.     earlier this month, talks in london to re-introduce export quotas, suspended in february 1986, ended in failure.     colombian finance minister cesar gaviria, also talking to reporters at the end of the weekly national coffee committee meeting, said the positions of brazil and of the united states were too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.     brazil's coffee chief jorio dauster said yesterday brazil would not change its coffee policies.     cardenas said the market situation was getting clearer because the trade knew the projected output and stockpile levels of producers.     he said according to ico statistics there was a shortfall of nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between october, the start of the coffee year, and february.  reuter &#3;</h3>
