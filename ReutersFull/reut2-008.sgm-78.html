	<h3>bank of italy governor carlo ciampi appointed three commissioners to take over the temporary running of the cassa di risparmio di calabria e lucania (carical).     the announcement, in a bank of italy statement, followed the decision on friday by treasury minister giovanni goria to send in special commissioners after accepting the resignation of carical president francesco sapio and hearing a report detailing "serious irregularities" at the bank.     goria's decision was taken in line with a provision in italy's banking legislation which allows the treasury to dissolve administrative bodies in the case of "serious management irregularities or serious violations of legal and statutory norms" that regulate credit institutions.     senior officials declined to give details of the irregularities that had come to light at carical, whose activities are concentrated in calabria in the toe of italy.     the bank of italy statement said the three special commissioners would work under the control of the bank of italy with the aim of safeguarding the interests of depositors, and ensuring the normal running of carical until a solution to its "present problems" could be found.     the statement said it was hoped a solution could be found as soon as possible.  reuter &#3;</h3>
