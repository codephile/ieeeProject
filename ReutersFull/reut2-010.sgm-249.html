	<h3>the international development association said it approved a 114 mln dlr credit for india to support several water irrigation projects.     ida, the world bank arm which lends to the poorest countries, said the projects are designed to increase agricultural productivity and farm incomes.     irrigation development has been a major factor in improving agricultural performance and yields in many areas but fall short of their potential due to unreliable water supply and often inequitable distribution, it noted.     ida said the credit supports a 7-year program to plan, implement and monitor improved operation of selected projects.     in addition to the 50-year credit, the indian government and participating states will provide 43 mln dlrs to the plan.  reuter &#3;</h3>
