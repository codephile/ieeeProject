	<h3>chrysler overseas capital corp said it authorized redemption on april 17 of its 4-3/4 pct and five pct convertible debentures due 1988.     the chrysler corp unit said the move is prompted by the parent company's three-for-two stock split, which requires a recalculation of the debentures' conversion prices that will adversely affect those prices by at least five pct.     chrysler said holders converting debentures before the stock split becomes effective march 23 will receive a greater number of shares on a post-split basis than if they convert afterwards.  reuter &#3;</h3>
