	<h3>u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng said the reagan administration had not decided on offering the soviet union subsidized wheat but that such an offer had not been ruled out.     in an interview with reuters, lyng also said that he had no knowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the cabinet.     asked if the administration had ruled out offering to subsidize wheat exports to the soviet union under the department's export enhancement program, lyng said, "no. we haven't made a decision on it, haven't even talked about it, haven't even looked at it."     reminded that there have been reports that moscow would buy u.s. wheat if competitively priced, lyng responded, "if they (the soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we accept it? it would depend on what price they offered."     lyng added that he did not think the price of u.s. wheat was far off the world price.     asked about persistent speculation that the administration would offer moscow a wheat subsidy, lyng said, "some people think they're doing it to see if they can get a little spurt in the market."     agriculture undersecretary daniel amstutz last week asked the commodity futures trading commission to investigate reports that wheat prices were being manipulated by reports that a u.s. wheat subsidy offer was imminent.  reuter &#3;</h3>
