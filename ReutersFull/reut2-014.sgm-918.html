	<h3>the bank of england said it provided the money market with 53 mln stg assistance in the morning session.     this compares with the bank's estimate of a shortage in the system of around 300 mln stg which it earlier revised up from 250 mln.     the central bank made outright purchases of bank bills comprising 46 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct and seven mln stg in band four at 9-11/16 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
