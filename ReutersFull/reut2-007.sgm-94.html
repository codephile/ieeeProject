	<h3>the european community (ec) commission said it approved a 680 mln stg british government aid package to state-owned rover group plc <blll.l> to restructure and privatise the group's bus and truck subsidiaries.     in a statement, the commission said rover's <leyland trucks> subsidiary would be financially and physically restructured following a recently announced merger between leyland trucks and <daf> of the netherlands.     the commission said government aid for this program was justified because it would contribute to europe-wide rationalisation of the truck sector.     the amount of aid approved is slightly below the 750 mln stg the british government had planned to grant rover by writing off accumulated losses and other costs.     the commission said there was overcapacity in the european truck industry estimated at between 25 and 40 pct.     it said its approval of the aid also took into account the consequences for jobs and for the regions affected by the restructuring.     under ec rules, the commission has to approve all government aid to industry.  reuter &#3;</h3>
