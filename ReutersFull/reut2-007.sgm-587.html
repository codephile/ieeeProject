	<h3>u.k building society net receipts in february were 472 mln stg, slightly up on january's 456 mln but well below the 793 mln stg of february 1986, the building societies' association (bsa) said.     bsa secretary-general mark boleat noted that net receipts were below 500 mln stg for the third month out of the last four.     "this was obviously a disappointing performance, especially in view of the rapid growth of mortgage commitments, to over 2.5 billion stg," he said.     the bsa said receipts were depressed by the british airways flotation, despite the later return of oversubscribed funds.     total building society receipts in february were 6.4 billion stg against withdrawals of 5.9 billion.     mortgage lending to home buyers during the month fell slightly to 2.16 billion stg from 2.18 billion stg in january, the bsa said. mortgage lending has fallen steadily since last july's peak of 3.9 billion stg.     net new mortgage commitments however rose to 2.5 billion stg from january's 1.9 billion, bringing the total commitments outstanding to 6.9 billion after january's 6.6 billion stg.     wholesale funding rose to 292 mln stg after january's 29 mln, but was still below each of the last six 1986 months.  reuter &#3;</h3>
