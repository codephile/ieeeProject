	<h3><noranda inc> said production will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper mine here until it can completely examine the mine.     the fire, which started wednesday and burned itself out late yesterday, killed one miner and trapped 56 others underground for about 24 hours. the 56 were eventually brought safely out of the mine.     company spokesman dale coffin said the investigation could take from a few days to several weeks, but would not be more specific.     noranda said that, when it resumes production, it plans to operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 metric tons annual finished capacity.     the fire weakened part of the mine's support structure, coffin said.     noranda said if it decides to keep the mine open, it would take four or five months before it could resume full production.  reuter &#3;</h3>
