	<h3>daimler-benz ag [daig.f] said its car production could fall by 150 cars a day in  the foreseeable future  if works councils continue to refuse to approve the firm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary.     a company spokesman said the works council at daimler's unterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components for daimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since the beginning of the month. the ig metall metalworkers union in the state of baden-wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ more workers.     the daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur.     a spokesman for dr.-ing. h.c. f. porsche ag [pshg.f], which is also located in baden-wuerttemberg, said he did not think porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on overtime by its own works councils.     a strike by ig metall in baden-wuerttemberg in 1984 closed down the german car industry for about seven weeks as the union sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. it later settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours.     the spokesman said daimler's total output of cars was currently around 2,500 a day.  reuter &#3;</h3>
