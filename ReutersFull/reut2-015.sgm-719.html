	<h3>the european commission was authorised to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores in the second half of june, although sales into intervention normally end on april 30, commission sources said.     they said approval was given by the ec's cereals management committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the ec and the united states.     the agreement guarantees access to the spanish market for two mln tonnes of non-ec maize a year for the next four years.     the sources said the intervention price for the maize would be 201.49 ecus a tonne.     they said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full     they added the decision is also designed to prevent massive offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal april 30 deadline, which could be caused by speculation about the implementation of the accord with the united states.  reuter &#3;</h3>
