	<h3>the philippines and its bank advisory committee completed another round of debt rescheduling talks  and will meet again on saturday, a senior banker said.     although today's negotiations did not produce a final agreement, the decision to meet at the weekend appears to be a signal that the two sides are making progress.     the philippines seeks to restructure 9.4 billion dlr of its 27.2 billion dlr foreign debt. the interest rate to be charged on the debt and manila's proposal to pay interest partly with investment notes instead of cash have been the main sticking points in the talks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
