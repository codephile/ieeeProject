	<h3>convergent technologies inc said it expects to report in the first quarter a loss more than twice the size of the 4.8-mln-dlr loss reported in the fourth quarter of 1986.     convergent reported a first quarter 1986 profit of 2,100,000 dlrs, or five cts per share.     the company said results declined in the quarter both in its traditional oem business and its business systems group.     the anticipated loss reflects lower than expected operating margins, start-up costs for new product manufacturing and higher than planned expenses.  reuter &#3;</h3>
