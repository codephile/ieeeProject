	<h3>the ec commission will decide shortly precisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and sorghum into the ec in fulfilment of its agreement with the united states, commission sources said.     under the accord, reached following u.s. complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of spanish ec membership, the ec will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.     all this produce will be imported into spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other ec countries.     the sources said it was possible that the spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.     they added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to spanish imports.     there will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and sorghum from spain to other ec countries, although such a tax could be imposed later, the sources added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
