	<h3>the national farmers union, nfu, remains concerned about the future ownership of british sugar despite last week's decision by the government to block bids from italy's gruppo ferruzzi and britain's tate & lyle plc.     the union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider the implications of a government monopolies and merger commission, mmc, report issued last week. "we are still concerned about s and w berisford being long-term owners of british sugar," a spokesman said. "we do not view berisford as providing the long-term stability we want."     the trade and industry secretary accepted a recommendation last week by the mmc that it block a bid by tate and lyle for s and w berisford plc and stop gruppo ferruzzi buying a majority of british sugar, owned by berisford.     union officials believe a new bid for the monopoly beet processor is now likely. "we are looking again at the undertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders and which we would seek of any future bidders," the spokesman said. the nfu, which represents britain's 11,500 sugar beet growers, is also taking legal advice on particular paragraphs in the mmc report which it says need further explanation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
