	<h3>new york stock exchange chairman john phelan said the nyse will continue to request that member firms refrain from using its order-delivery systems for program trading until the record trading volume slows down.     he said the firms are free to use other systems to do arbitrage between stock-index futures and their underlying stocks. "we are going to continue to get volatility for some time to come," phelan told a news conference.     he said program trading adds liquidity to the market but "at the extreme that adds to the volatility." he said further analysis of the issue is needed.     phelan said a significant number of corporations had begun buying back their own stock in a move that helped blue chips gain back some of monday's losses.     asked how the record decline on monday and the unprecedented trading volume affected the financial health of member firms, phelan said, "as far as we can tell, member firms are in good shape."     he said he expects to appear at a congression hearing in washington later this week that will examine the question of program trading.         phelan said nyse officials were in conference with other financial leaders and white house chief of staff howard baker for much of the day, adding that "the whole system has been very supportive."     he said three or four of the nyse's specialist firms required and received help with capital. he said these firms were no longer having capital problems but did not discuss specific figures. asked why some stocks were delayed on opening while others traded, he said the exchange did not want to keep the vast majority of the 1500 listed companies from trading.   reuter &#3;</h3>
