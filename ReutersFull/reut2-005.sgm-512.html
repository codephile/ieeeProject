	<h3>sources close to the italian state credit institution (istituto mobiliare italiano - imi) said a convertible bond issue was one of the possibilities being studied to facilitate market absorption of fiat shares sold last year by libya and still in the hands of banks.     the sources could give no further details of the options under study.     a fiat spokesman contacted by reuters said the company had no comment to make on the possibility of a convertible bond issue, saying any decision to be taken "did not depend on fiat."     italian press reports that a bond issue was under study pushed fiat's shares higher on the milan bourse today.     the company's ordinary shares closed in milan today at 12,540 lire in milan today, up from a closing 12,195 friday.     fiat preference shares and savings (non-voting) shares gained even more strongly, closing at 7,740 and 7,841 lire respectively against 7,353 and 7,600 friday.     bourse dealers say the fall in value of fiat stock over the last six months partly reflects selling by foreign operators of shares acquired as a result of the 2.1 billion dlr equity offer after libya sold its minority stake last september.     on september 23, 1986, the day fiat announced it had reached an agreement under which libya would sell its 15 pct stake, fiat shares closed in milan at 16,600 lire. since then, the trend has been down.     last september's share offer, which triggered criticism by underwriters about the handling of the sale, opened at a substantial discount to its offer price, resulting in losses for holders of the shares.     some analysts have said the size of offer was too big for the market to handle efficiently.  reuter &#3;</h3>
