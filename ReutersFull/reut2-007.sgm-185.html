	<h3>william bradt, new chairman of the new york mercantile exchange, nymex, said his priorities are to merge the exchange with other futures exchanges at the world trade center and to reallocate space on the crowded nymex floor.     bradt, a local trader and member of the board of governors, assumed his duties yesterday and met reporters.     "if all four exchanges become one, we would save incredible costs and become more competitive to chicago," bradt told reuters.     bradt was referring to a merger among the four exchanges at the commodity exchange center, an idea that has been discussed intermittently for several years.     the four exchanges -- the commodity exchange, the coffee, sugar and cocoa exchange, and the new york cotton exchange in addition to the nymex -- are all located on a single floor at the world trade center.     bradt said he would address the problem of space shortages on the exchange floor by reallocating booth space among the members, including sharing of booths.     "if you are a company with potential business for the merc, you should get a booth," he said, adding that an exchange committee is studying the problem.     the election of bradt, and of local trader vincent viola as an at-large member, increases representation of locals on the 15 member board to five members from four, according to a nymex spokesman.     bradt defeated vice chairman stanley meierfeld by a vote of 315 to 217. he will serve a two-year term and succeeds michel marks, who decided not to seek reelection after serving as chairman since 1978.     zoltan guttman was elected vice chairman and thomas mcmahon was elected as trade house representative.     john tafaro, owner of tafaro brokerage, was reelected as floor broker representative on the board, and george gero, a vice president of prudential-bache securities, was reelected as futures commission merchant representative.  reuter &#3;</h3>
