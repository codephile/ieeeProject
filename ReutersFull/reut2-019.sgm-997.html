	<h3>world oil prices would remain stable despite the u.s. attack against iranian oil platforms and growing tension in the gulf, venezuelan energy minister arturo hernandez grisanti said on monday.     he described the situation as "extremely tense," but said gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices because supply and demand were roughly equal.     demand for opec crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference.     hernandez grisanti said the supply/demand balance was precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction continued.     three or four members of the 13-nation organisation of petroleum exporting countries were "overproducing in an exaggerated manner" above their assigned quotas, he said.     opec's overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd.  reuter &#3;</h3>
