	<h3>the west german economics minister today denied giving a newspaper interview which quoted him as saying the state could not continue to pour money into the country's ailing steel and coal industries.     economics ministry spokesman dieter vogel said in a statement bangemann had contacted him from new zealand, where he is attending a general agreement on trade and tariffs (gatt) ministerial meeting, to deny giving the interview to the conservative daily die welt. the paper quoted bangemann as saying that continued subsidies would endanger other parts of the german economy by making them uncompetitive.     vogel said bangemann had pledged that everything possible would be done to minimize the effects of reduced coal and steel production on the workforces and regions concerned.     die welt said the interview with bangemann had taken place at a meeting of his free democratic party (fdp) in darmstadt last friday, adding that it had a tape recording of his comments which it would publish tomorrow.  reuter &#3;</h3>
