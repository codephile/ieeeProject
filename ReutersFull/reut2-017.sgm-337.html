	<h3>european community foreign ministers agreed to formal talks on signing an economic pact with hungary, in a move which could clear the way towards establishing ec diplomatic ties with budapest, ec officials said.     they said community foreign ministers agreed to mandate the ec executive commission to open talks on a cooperation pact which would boost trade and economic ties with hungary.     earlier this year, hungarian deputy prime minister jozsef marjai said hungary might be willing to normalise relations with the community in exchange for such a deal, according to ec officials. no date has been fixed for opening the talks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
