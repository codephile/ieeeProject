	<h3>memory metals inc said it received a contract from the national aeronautics and space administration to research and develop joints and couplings using special alloys.     the company said the two-year contract, worth 500,000 dlrs, calls for memory to study the joints and couplings for advanced composite materials, which are strong and light, but difficult to join reliably.     it said the alloys are trained to remember and take on a predetermined shape and selected temperaturers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
