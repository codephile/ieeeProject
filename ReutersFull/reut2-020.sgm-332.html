	<h3>iran's top war spokesman ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani on tuesday called the u.s. attacks on two of its gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.     "god willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days and make them sorry," said rafsanjani in a speech to parliament later broadcast by tehran radio.     the tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance after the u.s. raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.     president ali khamenei, prime minister mir-hossein mousavi and now rafsanjani within 24 hours of the u.s. action have all vowed retaliation.     rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, "it is not a threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it in practice." he added that the american attack "squares neither with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with security, nor reason and wisdom."     u.s. warships shelled an iranian offshore oil platform and american special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.     the u.s. government said the attack was a measured response to an iranian missile attack on the american-flagged kuwaiti tanker sea isle city in kuwaiti waters last friday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
