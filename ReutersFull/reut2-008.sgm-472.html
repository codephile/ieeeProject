	<h3>the philippines and its commercial bank advisory committee will resume talks tomorrow on what bankers hope will be the final leg of negotiations for a 9.4 billion dlr debt rescheduling package.     bankers, attending the inter-american development bank annual meeting here, said the two sides are still working on a plan that embraces manila's proposal to pay interest partly with philippine investment notes (pin) instead of cash.     one senior banker said he hoped that final agreement would be reached this week but cautioned that a number of major issues are still outstanding.     the senior banker said that the remaining issues include interest rates and the exact form of the investment notes plan.     however, bankers did not anticipate any accounting problems for this novel interest payment method.     deputy u.s. comptoller of the currency robert bench said last week that u.s. bank regulators also had no objection in principle to the pins concept because manila has guaranteed their ready conversion into cash.  reuter &#3;</h3>
