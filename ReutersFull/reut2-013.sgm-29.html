	<h3>burlington northern inc said its burlington northern railroad co unit reached an agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit filed against the company in may 1985 by holders of two series of the company's bonds.     it said the settlement arrangement calls for the company to establish a cash settlement fund of 35.5 mln dlrs, which would be distributed to the bondholders after deductions for attorney's fees.     the lawsuit, filed by holders of its four pct prior lien bonds due january 1, 1997 and its three pct general lien bonds due january 1, 2047, sought to prevent the release of collateral, the company said.     if the settlement agreement is approved, the trading prices of the bonds will decline substantially because they will no longer reflect the speculative premiums at which the bonds currently trade, burlington northern also said.     it said the settlement is subject to negotiation by burlington northern, the citibank n.a. unit of citicorp <cci> and bankers trust co <bt>, the bonds' trustees.  reuter &#3;</h3>
