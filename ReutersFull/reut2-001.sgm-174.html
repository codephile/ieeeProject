	<h3>a world bank team led by senior economist katrine saito arrived in uganda for talks on an economic recovery program projected to cost one billion dlrs over three years.     the four-member mission is expected to stay two to three weeks. an international monetary fund (imf) team is due here over the same period, a world bank offical said.     the world bank last year criticised uganda's policies on deficit financing and exchange and interest rates, issues likely to dominate talks on the government's proposed recovery program.     finance minister chrispus kiyonga said last month that most of the one billion dlrs would go towards rehabilitating industries, repairing and maintaining roads and buying tractors and other agricultural needs.     he did not say where the money would come from, but diplomats expect the government to ask the world bank and other foreign donors to provide most of the foreign exchange portion.  reuter &#3;</h3>
