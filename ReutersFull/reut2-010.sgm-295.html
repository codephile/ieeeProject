	<h3>the reserve bank said it will not offer any treasury notes for tender next week.     last week the bank offered 400 mln dlrs of 13-week notes and 100 mln dlrs of 26-week notes.     analysts said the bank's decision not to offer stock next week reflects the higher demand for funds at the start of the system of provisional tax payments.  reuter &#3;</h3>
