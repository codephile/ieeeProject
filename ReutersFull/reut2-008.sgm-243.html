	<h3>japan has assured a meeting of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy.     japanese trade representative tsomu hata told an informal general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) meeting that, in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last september, a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987/88 budget is approved.     hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting, said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy, but did not elaborate.     hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits, payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.  reuter &#3;</h3>
