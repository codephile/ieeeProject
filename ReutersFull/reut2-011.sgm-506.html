	<h3>cotton planting began in california and was expected to proceed rapidly in the week ended march 28, the joint agriculture weather facility of the u.s. agriculture and commerce departments said.     in a summary of its weather and crops bulletin, the agency said winds and low soil temperature retarded growth and hampered seeding in arizona.     planting moved into mohave and pinal counties.     cotton planting progressed well in the lower valley, coastal bend and along the upper coast of texas.     however, bad weather continued hampering cotton seedbed preparations in oklahoma.  reuter &#3;</h3>
