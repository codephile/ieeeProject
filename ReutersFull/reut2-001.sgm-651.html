	<h3>the size of french 1986/87 carryover barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, french cereals intervention office (onic) director bernard vieux said.     he told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the end of february from the previous month while export forecasts were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.     vieux called on the ec commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for french barley a large amount could be put into intervention.     a small amount of french barley has already been put into intervention, vieux said without detailing the amount.     the outlook for french maize is better with 1986/87 exports to non-ec countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000 tonnes at the end of january and against 155,000 tonnes in 1985/86.     the higher estimate is due to the ec commission's decision to hold special export tenders for french maize, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
