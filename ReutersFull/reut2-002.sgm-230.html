	<h3>non-opec egypt produced 40.3 mln tonnes (about 295 mln barrels) of crude in 1986 against 44.3 mln tonnes (about 323 mln barrels) in 1985, according to official figures released today by the egyptian general petroleum corp. (egpc).     officials say egypt can produce up to one mln bpd per day, but production was cut when world prices plunged last year.     in an attempt to help opec stabilize the world market, egypt cut its 1987 production target of 940,000 bpd to its current output of 870,000 bpd.     egypt, which exports a third of its output, currently sells its top suez and ras bahar blends for 17.25 dlrs a barrel.  reuter &#3;</h3>
