	<h3><ab catena>, in which ab volvo <volv.st> has a 48 pct stake, said it was proposing a two-for-five stock issue that will raise the company's equity capital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln.     catena reported profits after financial income and costs up to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in 1985.     the company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985.     catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of safveans ab in february 1986, which changed the business profile of catena. it had principally operated as a volvo dealer. with the safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company.     in december 1986 catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm jacobson och ponsbach fondkommission ab. this yielded a profit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in catena's pre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in 1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
