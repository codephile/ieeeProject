	<h3>the philippines' restructuring of 13.2 billion dlrs of foreign debt will provide a welcome boost for the economy, but last friday's accord with the country's 12-bank advisory committee does not imply an overnight boom, bankers and businessmen polled by reuters said.     "the successful negotiations form an important piece in the mosaic," christian roeher, secretary-general of the european chamber of commerce, said. "now is really the time for the government to start implementing its ideas. there has been a lot of talking and loud thinking."     business leaders said the 17-year rescheduling of commercial bank debt would give president corazon aquino some badly-needed breathing space, but warned her government was still in the midst of political consolidation.     "there is a lot of interest among foreign investors in the country, but now they are waiting to see what happens in the congressional and local elections later this year," said american chamber of commerce president george drysdale.     the government is serious about getting down to work, but there are many individual agendas for growth and no consensus. but each step brings a unanimity of opinion closer, he said.     aurelio periquet, president of the philippine chamber of commerce and industry, told reuters the debt accord had positively translated the international banking community's confidence in the country's economy and aquino's government.     "this government needs less pressure and more time and happily our creditors seem to see it that way," he said. "this accord may not result in an immediate boom, but at least it enhances the image of the country for foreign investors."     but periquet said domestic and foreign investments fell short of targets in 1986. "the accord does not solve all our problems," he added.     periquet said the question of political stability no longer worried filipino businessmen, who had already started expanding existing businesses or investing in new areas.     "a number of us have already put in new money and there are plans for the export market," he said. "president aquino has shown her ability to pull the nation out of one crisis after another."     roeher said foreign investment would probably be held back until after the congressional polls in may and the local elections in august. "the two elections will probably have a more decisive effect on the way business reacts," he said.     "some foreign companies are not waiting, but they are more the exception than the rule," roeher said.     he said it was important the government ensure the creation of more jobs was not just a transitory development.     "the absorption of enormous aid given to the philippines is also poor. a lot of it has not been put to use. the government should act without further delay to absorb the 1.7 billion dlrs of development aid it will receive in 1987," he said.     a foreign banker close to the debt negotiations said he did not foresee any real boom until 1989.     "the problem is that aquino has inherited her political system from (former president ferdinand) marcos," the banker said. "there is still a clamour for the sharing of benefits, different sectors claiming their rights and duties. if they go too fast there could be another bust two years down the road."     businessman raul concepcion, whose brother jose is the country's trade and industry minister, said everyone could heave a sigh of relief. "now that the debt agreement is out of the way, our economic and financial officials can concentrate on their work, like increasing government revenue and efficiency," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
