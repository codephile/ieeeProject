	<h3>new zealand clearing house <databank systems ltd> said it will know tomorrow what services it will be able to provide during a strike by bank officers against trading banks and databank set for march 9 and 10.     trading banks polled by reuters said their ability to offer money market services during the strike depends on whether databank remains open, and whether the banks have enough staff to process transactions.     a spokesman for the new zealand foreign exchange association said dealers would be able to trade during the strike.     but the spokesman added that from march 6 to 10 the value date of currency transactions will be march 16.     trading bank spokesmen told reuters they will try to honour transactions in which an offshore party sought payment on march 9 or 10, but they could not guarantee settlement.     the futures exchange said trading members and their clients will be able to continue trading provided they have made suitable financial arrangements.     the trading banks affected are the <bank of new zealand>, australia and new zealand banking group ltd <anza.s>, westpac banking corp <wstp.s> and <national bank of new zealand ltd>.  reuter &#3;</h3>
