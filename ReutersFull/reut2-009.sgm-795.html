	<h3>the latest round of talks between philippine officials and the country's commercial bank creditors on the rescheduling of 9.4 billion dlrs worth of debt are still proceeding, but with a narrower focus, philippine finance secretary jaime ongpin said.     he told a press briefing wednesday that manila has dropped a two-tier interest payment offer, which would have given banks a higher return if they took partial payment in new philippine investment notes (pins) instead of in cash.     "the pins proposal has been laid aside.... the discussion is now on pricing (of just the cash payments)," he said.     foreign banking sources in manila said on tuesday that the philippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8 over the london interbank offered rate (libor) but ongpin would not discuss details of the pricing negotiations.     he also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement might be reached. the talks have been going on for more than three weeks.     manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8 over libor or in a mixture of cash and pins -- tradeable, dollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially yield up to one point over libor.     the pins option was subsequently modified to guarantee at least a 7/8 point spread over libor but many bankers still had grave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other large debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.     the pins proposal has now been left on the table as a separate option for those banks, which might want to fund their own investments in the philippines or sell the notes in the secondary market, ongpin said.     under manila's plan, the pins would be redeemable at full face value in philippine pesos to fund local equity investments at any time prior to their six-year maturity date.     while the commercial banks had their doubts about the pins proposal, ongpin said there was great interest on the part of certain investment banks which are already active in the secondary market for sovereign debt.     unlike current debt/equity schemes, ongpin said, the pins would include no government fees and would be free from "administrative hassles."     he said about six investment banks had been approached and four had replied so far. one even showed interest in buying 45 mln dlrs worth of notes, he said.     ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in the secondary market through the pins scheme, the philippines could conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign exchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring period.  reuter &#3;</h3>
