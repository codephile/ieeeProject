	<h3>an agreement in the debt rescheduling talks between the philippines and its commercial bank advisory committee seems to be close at hand, said david mulford, assistant secretary of the u.s. treasury.     "the philippines negotiations resumed in early march and agreement now appears to be very near," mulford told a debt conference, organized by the euromoney magazine.     mulford gave no further details. he told reporters after his speech that he had no information on the banks' response to the philippines' revised proposal, based on partial payment of interest with investment notes instead of cash.     progress in the philippines talks, following recent agreements with mexico, chile and venezuela, will help to dispel concerns of a new debt crisis, mulford told the conference.     however, he said there will continue to be difficulties and periods of significant risk, requiring creative thinking on the part of the banks.     in particular, he urged the banks to develop a "menu of options for supporting debtor reforms as a means of maintaining broad bank participation in new financing packages."     mulford said the banks should be able to offer a range of options to members of the lending syndicates, provided that the liquidity value of the total transactions to the debtor nations is equivalent to the banks' new money obligation.     he said it is more important to find ways of encouraging banks to remain in the syndicates than to find ways of enabling them to quit the lending groups.     mulford said his menu of options could include more trade credits, direct portfolio investments, debt/equity swaps, project loans, co-financings and the invesmtent note concept, which has been proposed by the philippines.  reuter &#3;</h3>
