	<h3>the international primary market makers association, a trade organisation, said its board last week adopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bond issues make a market in that security for 12 months.     currently, while there is an implied obligation on the part of firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is no formal obligation to do so.     christopher sibson, secretary general of ipma, in explaining why the recommendation was adopted, said "it is aimed at the problem of the lead manager who does a deal and disappears."     sibson said the organization cannot force its members to adhere to the rule. "we're under no illusions about the legal binding force of these recommendations," he said.     lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts to support an unprofitable issue just a short while after it has been offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no one to buy it back from them.     most recently, when prices of perpetual floating rates notes (frns) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned the securities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17 billion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.      sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the board only applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not have helped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.     among other measures, the ipma also decided that the criteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some of the smaller firms.     under the new rules, a firm must be the book running lead manager during the two preceding years of 12 internationally distributed debt issues denominated in u.s. dlrs or in one of eight other major currencies.     the former requirement called for three lead-managed issues. sibson said he expects the tighter entrance requirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six to 10 members.     smaller firms have criticized ipma's efforts to restrict membership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive and that it reinforces the big firms' already large market share.     "belonging to ipma carries a certain amount of prestige with borrowers," said a dealer at a small foreign bank. "the borrower says to himself, "well i can travel economy or i can travel first class,'" he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
