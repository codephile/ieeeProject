	<h3>brazil is not selling cocoa beans to the international cocoa organization, icco, buffer stock, as spot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pct higher than levels which would be paid by the icco buffer stock manager, trade sources in the major producing state bahia said.     the scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above international levels, the sources noted.     the only buyers are bean exporters or local processors covering previously contracted commitments, they added.     if sales were made they would be executed by individual exporting companies which are members of the brazilian cocoa trade commission, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
