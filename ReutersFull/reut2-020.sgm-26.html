	<h3>finance minister roger douglas said the fall in share prices on local and world markets demonstrated that new zealand could not be isolated from global trends.     "we can't expect to isolate ourselves from developments around the world," douglas told reporters.     "i think above all what today's problems illustrate is that the sort of policies that we have been putting in place the last three years are absolutely essential so that new zealand's economic performance improves, relative to the rest of the world."     the new zealand share market fell 14.7 pct on tuesday in a record one-day fall.     douglas told a news conference, at which the government announced plans to sell its 89 pct stake in <new zealand steel ltd>, that the sharemarket fall would not affect plans to sell parts of state-owned corporations such as <air new zealand>, <dfc new zealand ltd> and <petroleum corp of new zealand ltd>. asked if the government considered acting to close the sharemarket for a period, douglas said: "no. i'm not sure it would have been my job to do so."  reuter &#3;</h3>
