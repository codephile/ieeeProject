	<h3>washington water power co said it requested the washington utilities and transportation commission to issue an accounting order which would revise the current method of accounting for investment tax credits.     approval of the order would allow the company to apply tax credits to earnings in 1987, 1988 and 1989 rather than spreading those credits over a period of about 30 years under the current method.     a similar request was filed with the idaho public utilities commission in november of 1986 but hearings have been delayed until later in 1987.  reuter &#3;</h3>
