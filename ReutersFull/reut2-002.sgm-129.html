	<h3>mci communications corp president bert roberts said he expects mci's financial performance to improve in the current quarter compared to the previous quarter.     he said american telephone and telegraph co long-distance rate cuts had cut into mci's fourth quarter performance but added: "there's going to be a continuing impact (on profits) but we expect this quarter to be better than the fourth quarter."     the current quarter ends march 31.     for the fourth quarter, mci reported a 448 mln dlr loss, due mainly to write-offs and staff reductions.     roberts said the att long-distance rate reductions, which had been ordered by the federal communications commission have had "a significantly negative impact on our profits."     as reported earlier today, mci said it plans to ask the fcc to immediately deregulate att, apparently in hopes that an unregulated att would pocket a greater proportion of its revenues rather than cut rates further.  reuter &#3;</h3>
