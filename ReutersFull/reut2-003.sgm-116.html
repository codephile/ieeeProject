	<h3>(charan industries inc), a distributor of toys and other consumer products, expects 1987 net profit to rise at least 50 pct over last year's 6.1 mln dlrs, president earl takefman told reporters before the annual meeting.     "we grew basically 100 pct last year, i'm not sure we're going to be able to grow 100 pct again this year but we certainly will grow at least 50 pct over last year," takefman said.     charan reported profit of 3.0 mln dlrs in 1985.     takefman said he expects sales to rise to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 57.3 mln dlrs in 1986.     fiscal 1985 ended september 30, while fiscal 1986 ended november 30.     takefman said the company is actively looking for acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in canada.     the company said it expects to resolve delivery problems this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy distribution business, which accounts for about one-third of revenues.     charan is the exclusive distributor in canada for <worlds of wonder> toys, which include the teddy ruxpin voice-activated talking plush bear.     takefman said new products this year, which will be on the shelves for christmas, include a smaller version of teddy ruxpin, a talking mickey mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and talking books.     the company is also marketing an extended line of "laser tag" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when you've hit someone.     other products include a recorder device which allows students to leave taped messages in each others' school lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
