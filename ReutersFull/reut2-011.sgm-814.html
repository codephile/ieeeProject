	<h3>grain traders said they were still awaiting results of yesterday's u.k. intervention feed wheat tender for the home market.     the market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes, more than double the remaining 150,000 tonnes available under the current tender. however, some of the tonnage included duplicate bids for supplies in the same stores.     since the tenders started last july 861,000 tonnes of british feed wheat have been sold back to the home market.  reuter &#3;</h3>
