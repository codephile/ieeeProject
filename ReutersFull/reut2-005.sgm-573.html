	<h3>the united states and turkey signed a five-year defence and economic agreement (deca) that will channel hundreds of millions of dollars a year in aid to ankara.     the agreement was signed by secretary of state george shultz and foreign minister vahit halefoglu after 18 months of negotiations that won ankara considerably less than it wanted.     under the agreement, the u.s. government pledged it would use "vigor and determination" to persuade congress to vote the money to build up turkish defenses in return for u.s. air bases and intelligence-gathering facilities.     under today's agreement, which runs until december, 1990, turkey will receive nearly 720 mln dlrs in military and economic aid this year.     next year, the u.s. government has promised to ask congress for 910 mln dlrs under an agreement that prompted domestic crticism in turkey for not winning enough aid.  reuter &#3;</h3>
