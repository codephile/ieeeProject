	<h3>the canadian industrial product price index, base 1981, fell 0.2 pct in february after rising 0.2 pct in january, statistics canada said.     "a significant part of this monthly decrease was attributable to the impact of the increase of the canadian dollar on prices for wood pulps, newspaper, aluminum, nickel and motor vehicles," the federal agency said.     on a year-over-year basis, the index was down 0.8 pct, little change from the 0.9 pct decline posted in january.  reuter &#3;</h3>
