	<h3>u.s. legislators called on japan to open its financial markets to more foreign participation and boost its efforts to head off growing u.s. protectionism, a foreign ministry spokesman said.     "we have come to seek the opening of japan's financial and banking markets," jake garn, ranking republican on the senate banking committee, told prime minister yasuhiro nakasone.     "japan's financial and banking market is very large and increasingly sophisticated, but there is not yet true reciprocity between japan and the united states in this market," the ministry official quoted garn as saying.     nakasone replied that some problems exist over providing more seats on the tokyo stock exchange for foreign firms, one of the main steps urged by the u.s. delegation.     "but i promise to make tokyo's markets as open as those of new york," he told garn and three other legislators.     in separate talks with finance minister kiichi miyazawa, the u.s. group also urged japan to give u.s. financial institutions a bigger role in the underwriting of long-term japanese government bonds, a finance ministry spokesman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
