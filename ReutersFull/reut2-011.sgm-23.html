	<h3>newmont mining corp will seek favorable terms for sale of its south african investments, the proxy statement for its annual meeting said.     recommending that shareholders vote against a proposal calling expeditious withdrawal from south africa, the proxy said "a quick sale could be akin to abandonment" because of the depressed state of metal mining stocks and exchange rates on capital withdrawals from south africa.     the proxy said the company gave close consideration to alternatives to the continued holdings of four existing south african metal mining investments during the past year.     pointing out "a measurable number of investors incline to support" resolutions calling for south african divestment as part of their effort to avoid pressure to sell a given stock, the company said "this largely unspoken agenda of many supporters of disinvestment does receive attention by the corporation."     because of this, newmont mining said it "is prepared to consider, and will seek, favorable terms for sale of its south african investments," but asked stockholders to reject the resolution calling for withdrawal and leave the matter to the continuing judgment of management.  reuter &#3;</h3>
