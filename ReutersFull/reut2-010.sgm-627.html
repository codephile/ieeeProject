	<h3>iran has produced a short-range surface-to-surface missile with technological help from china and is working with peking on a longer-range missile capable of hitting most areas of iraq, the observer newspaper said.     the british sunday paper, quoting iranian sources, said the shorter-range missile was based on a chinese version of the soviet-made frog and had been fired at the iraqi port of basra. the missile has a range of 40 miles.     the other type, similar to the soviet army"s scud b with a range of 180 miles, is at an advanced stage of development, according to the observer.     the development of a longer-range weapon would enable iran to strike at many towns and cities on the territory of its relatively small neighbour.     earlier this month, iran acknowledged it had acquired chinese-made silkworm missiles capable of hitting tankers carrying crude oil from arab countries to the west.     iran said it would use its silkworm anti-ship missile against shipping in the waterway only if iraqi air and missile raids prevented it from exporting oil.     the silkworms are large mobile missiles with a range of 60 miles, which can carry a warhead of 1,000 pounds.  reuter &#3;</h3>
