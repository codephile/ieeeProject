	<h3>the united food and commercial workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the union will demonstrate monday at dart group corp's headquarters protesting dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of supermarkets general <sgl>.     supermarkets is best known for its pathmark chain of supermarket drug stores in the new york and new jersey area and also owns rickels home centers.     the union said that it is firmly against the dart bid because "workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the current takeover mania."     a union statement said: "we do not intend to allow our members to pick up the tab for supermarket general's executives and the bankers or the dart group who stand to make millions."     dart is controlled by the haft family of washington, which last year made a bid for california-based safeway stores inc. the hafts lost, but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in profits, analysts estimate.     the union said that dart's safeway bid forced a major restructuring at safeway to pay the hafts and their lawyers and caused a loss of thousands of jobs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
