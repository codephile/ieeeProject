	<h3>diamond shamrock corp, which will split this month into two separate companies, expects to show improved earnings in 1987 over last year, executives of the new company told reuters.     charles blackburn, president and chief executive officer of diamond shamrock and the new company, which will emphasize exploration and production, said, "earnings wil be better than in 1986." he declined to say how much better.     in 1986 diamond shamrock reported a loss of 115.6 mln dlrs on total revenues of 2.543 billion dlrs. exploration and production lost 18.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 593.5 mln dlrs.     roger hemminghaus, diamond shamrock vice president and soon-to-be chief executive of the spin-off diamond shamrock refining and marketing co, said, "refining and marketing is a margin business. the margins will return and this will be a better year than 1986."     in 1986, refining and marketing showed operating profits of 40.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.636 billion dlrs.     "we are also expecting to be in the black in the first quarter (1987)," heminghaus added. in the first quarter of 1986, the refining and marketing segment showed a loss of 27.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 492.1 mln dlrs.         the executives were in new york for meetings with institutional investors aimed at increasing interest in the company's stock.     on the new york stock exchange, diamond shamrock was trading at 16-1/4, down 1/4.     earlier this year, t. boone pickens offered 15 dlrs a share for diamond shamrock, and management countered with an offer at 17 dlrs and a decision to split off the refining and marketing operation to its shareholders.     "our advisors convinced us the market would give higher multiples for pure plays," blackburn said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
