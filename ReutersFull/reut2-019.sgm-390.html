	<h3>moody's investors service inc said it cut to b-2 from ba-1 diamond bathurst inc's subordinated notes of 1995.     moody's said it expects the company's operating performance would be hurt by heightened competition and by the increasing inroads being made by other forms of packaging.     it said diamond should benefit from production efficiency, quality control and plant closings. but due to the company's major role in selling to the distilled spirits industry, one of the smaller markets for glass containers, its margins and asset returns may not materially improve, moody's said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
