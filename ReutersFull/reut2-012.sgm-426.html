	<h3>hong kong land co ltd <hkld.hk> said it might look for overseas investments and that could lead it to consider re-registering in bermuda.     asked if hong kong land had any plans for investment overseas a spokesman said "not at the moment. it's a long-term concept."     the london newspaper daily telegraph yesterday quoted simon keswick, chairman of hong kong land's parent company, jardine matheson holdings ltd <jard.hk>, as saying the company was at a crossroads because the last of its non-property assets will soon be spun off.     hongkong land's residential properties have also been sold, leaving the firm largely with commercial property in the main business district of the british colony.     "if we can't find any opportunities we might have to look abroad," keswick was quoted by the newspaper as saying.     a re-registration in bermuda would be largely to shelter overseas income from hong kong taxes, analysts said.     jardine matheson reincorporated in bermuda in 1984 in a move that raised fears over the colony's political future and stunned the local stock market.     that response was not repeated when <dairy farm international holdings ltd> then a hongkong land subsidiary, and <mandarin oriental international ltd>, soon to be spun off from land, announced plans for similar re-registrations.     jardine strategic holdings ltd <jsh.hk>, another jardine subsdidiary, is also registered in bermuda.  reuter &#3;</h3>
