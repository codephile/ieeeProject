	<h3>basf ag said the volatile currency situation last year, particularly the fall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominated in marks and to price reductions for exports from domestic production.     but in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the group said it expected satisfactory business development over the next months. "at the moment we do not expect any extraordinary influences such as there were last year," it said. orders in hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level.     basf reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.     the unusual situation on the crude oil market last year also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and forced price declines for petrochemical products, basf said.     the fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. in the parent company, the positive earnings development continued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to 1.97 billion marks. the decline in parent company turnover was balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in raw materials.      in 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47 billion marks compared to 1985, basf said. parent turnover fell 8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.     turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors fine chemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved in those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985.     results from these had been taken only partly into the fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.     so far in the current year, the investment volume of the parent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986, basf said, without giving concrete figures.  reuter &#3;</h3>
