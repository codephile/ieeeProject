	<h3>prime minister yasuhiro nakasone's unpopular sales tax plan suffered another dent today when members of his ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) called for time to be taken in dealing with the proposed sales tax, party officials said.     the call came in a resolution adopted by a group of some 150 ldp parliamentarians and secretaries, acting on behalf of their parliamentarians, at a meeting at the ldp headquarters, they said. the mps represented seemed to account for one-third of ldp mps.     the group is an ldp voluntary organisation, called the parliamentarians' research society for reestablishment of finances claiming a membership of about 300 mps, they said.     meanwhle, nakasone this evening hinted that his party might be ready to accept some modification to the five-pct sales tax proposal after the fiscal 1987 state budget plan was passed by parliament. the ldp suffered a setback in last sunday's local elections because of the controvertial tax plan. the result also undermined nakasone's prestige, giving rise to a possibility that he might be forced out of office before october 30, when he is supposed to step down.  reuter &#3;</h3>
