	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it downgraded to aa from aa-plus the kingdom of denmark's long-term external debt.     the action affects the equivalent of 17.6 billion u.s. dlrs of debt.     s and p cited denmark's weakened external competitiveness, saying it contributed to a steady deterioration of the country's current account balance and a substantial rise in its external debt burden.     net foreign debt increased to 129 pct of total exports in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, s and p pointed out.     standard and poor's said that while it expects lower imports and current account imbalances this year, rising labor costs should further weaken denmark's competitiveness.     however, s and p said its downgrade did not affect the a-1-plus short-term debt rating of denmark or its wholly owned danish oil and natural gas.     similarly, the aa ratings on the long-term debt obligations of copenhagen county authority and i/s elsam were affirmed.  reuter &#3;</h3>
