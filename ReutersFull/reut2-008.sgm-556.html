	<h3>jill considine, new york state superintendent of banks, said a federal banking bill proposal now before the senate, which includes a moratorium on new non-bank activities by bank holding companies, would preempt state banking authority.     "this bill purports to freeze the 'status quo' of banking but in fact only magnifies the existing competitive inequalities and places a strait-jacket on the ability of states to permit banks to diversify their services and expand geographically," considine said in a statement.     "this bill is antithetical to the concept of the dual banking system, which encourages states to experiment and innovate," she added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
