	<h3>the proposed european community (ec) tax on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the agenda and the ec commission merely used it as a threat, the west german feed stuffs industry association (mfi) said.     association chairman ulrich wagner told a news conference the west german feed industry believes the ec does not seriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it would end in another transatlantic trade war.     "we have just avoided a trade conflict with the u.s. and the commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies."     american soybean association (asa) president-elect wayne bennett said yesterday in the hague that u.s. soybean producers were confident the tax would be rejected.     bennett, who is leading one of three soybean delegations on a lobbying tour of ec capitals, will also visit bonn on thursday and friday.     there are indications the bonn government will also reject the proposed tax, wagner said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
