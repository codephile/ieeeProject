	<h3>sugar beet planting in denmark is about two weeks behind normal due to a severe winter and a wet spring, a spokesman for the country's largest sugar beet concern, de danske sukkerfabrikker a/s, said.     the weather has improved recently but very little beet has been drilled so far.     "if good weather conditions continue, i think we will be sowing next week or the following week," the spokesman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
