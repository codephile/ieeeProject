	<h3>simex currency futures eased in early dealings, after a higher opening in quiet and cautious trading, dealers said.     they said operators were unwilling to take large positions ahead of the expected group of seven ministers meeting in washington today.     participants also were cautious because of persistent bank of japan dollar buying intervention, with dollar supportive comments by federal reserve chairman and japan's finance minister having little impact, dealers said.     june mark eased to around 0.5500 dlrs from a 0.5510 opening and chicago's 0.00501 and yen to 0.006910 against 0.006920 and 0.006913. about 200 lots of mark and 65 lots of yen were traded.     june sterling was indicated at 1.6075/85 dlrs against chicago's 1.6080 with no business seen in the first trading hour.     speculative buying helped nikkei stock average index futures to firm in early trading, after a lower opening following weaker new york stock market. june firmed  to 22,920 from a 22,550 low and 22,895 here yesterday with about 400 lots exchanged.     gold futures remained idle. reuter &#3;</h3>
