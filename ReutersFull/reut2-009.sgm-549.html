	<h3>the u.s. commodity credit corporation (ccc) has authorized an additional 10.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees to cover sales of u.s. vegetable oils to north yemen, the u.s. agriculture department said.     the department also said at the request of the north yemen government five mln dlrs in credit guarantees previously earmarked for sales of wheat have been switched to cover sales of mixed poultry feed.     the actions increase the value of credit guarantees for vegetable oil for the current fiscal year to 38 mln dlrs, reduce the guarantee coverage for sales of wheat to eight mln dlrs and increase the coverage for sales of mixed poultry feed to 10 mln dlrs.     all exports must be completed by september 30, 1987.  reuter &#3;</h3>
