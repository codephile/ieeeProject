	<h3>the andean development corp (caf) said today it is lending 11.7 mln dlrs to ecuador to help repair 25 miles of oil pipeline destroyed by an earthquake earlier this month.     the loan was signed here today in the offices of the caracas based caf by the corporation's president, galo montano perez and ecuadorean ambassador antonio parra gil.     the loan had originally been intended to finance an expansion of the pipeline, but following the earthquake the ecuadorean government asked for the terms to be changed so as to permit their use in reconstruction.     ecuador expects oil production to be suspended for four months as a result of the damage, and has asked venezuela to help by supplying 50,000 barrels per day while the pipeline is repaired.     the opec member has a production quota of 210,000 bpd but has asked the organization to allow it to produce 310,000 bpd once the repairs are completed so as to compensate the loss.  reuter &#3;</h3>
