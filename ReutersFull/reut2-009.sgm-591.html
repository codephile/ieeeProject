	<h3>brazil wants to increase its steel exports to the united states, now limited because of tough import restraints set in 1984 by the reagan administration, a spokeswoman for the brazilian steel institute (ibs) said.     brazilian and u.s. trade officials held the first of a three-day meeting today in brasilia to discuss the issue.     in 1984, after three months of painstaking negotiations, the u.s. government reached accords with seven steel-exporting nations - australia, brazil, japan, mexico, spain, south africa and south korea - to reduce their shipments to the united states by about 30 pct in 1985.     the 1984 restraints established that for 1987 brazil's steel exports to the u.s. could not exceed 632,000 tonnes, increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in 1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.     brazilian officials are trying to increase brazil's export share of non-flat products to the u.s. market.     the spokeswoman said there were reports of domestic supply problems in the united states.  reuter &#3;</h3>
