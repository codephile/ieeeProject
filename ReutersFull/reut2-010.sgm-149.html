	<h3>moody's investors service inc said it may downgrade british petroleum co plc's 3.5 billion dlrs of debt and standard oil co's 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.     the agency cited british petroleum's 7.4 billion dlr tender offer today for the remaining 45 pct of standard oil shares it does not already own.     moody's said that while british petroleum has greatly strengthened its capital structure over the past few years, this acquisition would seriously affect the company's liquidity, leverage and interest coverage.     moody's noted that british petroleum would use more than two billion dlrs of excess cash and marketables and about five billion dlrs of new acquisition debt to fund the transaction.     in addition, the minority interest and deferred income taxes attributable to standard oil would be excluded from british petroleum's capitalization. that would result in a total debt to capital ratio of nearly 50 pct, moody's said.     the rating agency said it would study b.p.'s strategy to restore financial flexibility after the acquisition. moody's said that may include divestiture of various petroleum and non-petroleum assets and operations of b.p. and standard.     but moody's noted that after the major asset writedown and divestiture progress achieved by standard oil in 1985, fewer non-petroleum assets are available for sale.     under review are the a-1 senior debt of issues guaranteed by british petroleum, including eurobonds of bp capital b.v., debentures of bp north america finance corp, eurodebt of british petroleum b.v., bpca finance ltd and bp canadian holdings ltd, debentures and medium-term notes of bp north america inc. also, the a-1 debt of standard oil and sohio pipeline, and debentures of sohio/bp trans-alaska pipeline guaranteed severally and not jointly by b.p. and standard.  reuter &#3;</h3>
