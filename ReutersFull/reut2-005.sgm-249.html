	<h3>pearson plc <pson.l> said the recent sale of its fairey engineering companies, in a 51.5 mln stg management buy-out, was part of its policy of concentrating on four key sectors.     in a statement with its 1986 results, the company said its information and entertainments sector's financial times, ft, newspaper had record sales and profits.     the ft is subject to a 70 mln stg investment programme, with the printing and publishing operation moving to a new plant in the london docklands next year.     its other key sectors are merchant banking, oil and china.     commenting on its camco inc oil service subsidiary, pearson said it believes the oil business setback is only temporary.     the group has been acquiring oil properties in both the u.s. and britain which will begin to make a significant impact on profits in the 1990s.     far east operations of fine china subsidiary royal doulton ltd are being expanded in the wake of record recent sales in japan, it added.     pearson reported 1986 pre-tax profit of 121.1 mln stg, up from 109.3 mln in 1985. turnover fell to 953 mln from 970 mln.   reuter &#3;</h3>
