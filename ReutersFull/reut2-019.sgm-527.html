	<h3>imf managing director michel camdessus paid a brief weekend visit to the ivory coast during which he discussed the country's economic difficulties with president felix houphouet-boigny.     camdessus said he wished his visit could have been in more pleasant circumstances in remarks reported by the official ivorian daily fraternite matin.     he added that the extremely steep fall in agricultural commodity markets had dealt a harsh blow this year to the ivorian economy and because of this the country was experiencing a growth problem and difficulties with its international debt.     last month the ivory coast informed its creditors it had to suspend payments on its foreign debt, estimated at more than eight billion dlrs.     camdessus said his agency had to study the problems of the ivory coast but a solution depended on a coordinated effort between the country itself, the commercial banks, other governments and international finance institutions.     he also disussed problems of developing countries in general with banking and government officials in abidjan.  reuter &#3;</h3>
