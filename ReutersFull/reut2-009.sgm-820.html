	<h3>britain's visible trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in february from 527 mln in january, the trade and industry department said.     the current account balance of payments in february showed a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg compared with a surplus of 73 mln in january.     invisibles in february were put provisionally at a 600 mln surplus, the same as in january.     seasonally adjusted, imports rose in february to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in january. exports rose to a record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in january.     trade department officials said the improvement in britain's current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in february than might otherwise have been expected.     the department said exceptionally cold weather in january reduced exports that month and that there had been an element of catching up in the february figures.     the seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from 114.6 in january and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.     the value of british oil exports in february rose to 751 mln stg from 723 mln in jnauary while oil imports rose to 425 mln from 352 mln.  reuter &#3;</h3>
