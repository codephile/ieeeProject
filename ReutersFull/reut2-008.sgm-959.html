	<h3>wainoco oil corp said it is undergoing a recapitalization program with a proposed offering of two mln units consisting of common shares and warrants, the planned redemption of its shareholder value rights, and a change in its corporate structure that substantially reduces futurer income taxes.     wainoco said it had filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the offering of the two mln units consisting of two shares of common stock and one warrrant per unit for a total of four mln shares of common stock and two mln warrants.     included in the two mln units to be offered are 280,000 shares of common stock to be sold by <waverly oil co>,  a selling shareholder of wainoco, it said.     proceeds of the offering will be used to reduce bank debt, the company said. it said its outstanding 10-3/4 pct subordinated debentures may be used at face value to pay the exercise price of the warrants.     wainoco said the offering will be underwritten by  e.f. hutton and co inc, kidder peabody and co inc, and smith barney harris upham inc.     simultaneous with the offering, wainoco said it intends to redeem its shareholder value rights attached to each common share at 10 cts per right. wainoco said without redemption of the value rights, the company would not have sufficient authorized and unissued shares of common stock to complete the units offering.     due to certain covenants under the company's 10-3/4 pct subordinated debentures, the value rights redemption is contingent upon the success of the units offering, it said.     wainoco's said its shareholders purchase rights distributed to the shareholders in june 1986 are unaffected and remain valid.     it said as a result of the liquidation of its canadian subsidiary into the parent company, it will be able to offset all of its corporate overhead expenses and some of its debenture interests against canadian income for tax purposes.     wainoco said its pool of future canadian tax deductions has been increased by an amount which should generate savings that will exceed existing deferred income tax liability.     existing u.s. tax loss carryforward benefits in the u.s. are not materially affected, the company said. it added this will considerably reduce future income taxes in canada and add to wainoco's net income and cash flow for a number of years.     john ashmun, chairman of wainoco, said "as a result of this recapitalization, wainoco will be in a strong financial position.     "our net income and cash flow will benefit from lower interest expense, lower canadian taxes, and the considerable savings achieved over the past few years from cost reductions," he said.     ashmun said the company will be able to "utilize enhanced cash flow to develop its large resource base and explore for additional reserves at a time when exploration and development costs are low and opportunities abound rather than using a disproportiaonate share of cash flow for debt service."  reuter &#3;</h3>
