	<h3>the association of white metals has decided to publish a daily tin price here in french francs per 100 kilos, the french federation of non-ferrous metals said.     the price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for some french companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals association said.     today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and tuesday's at 4,790.     the international chamber of commerce stopped publishing a tin price after the london metal exchange (lme) stopped tin trading on october 24, 1985.     the association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a french franc price over the last few months to ensure it was reliable, the spokesman said.     the french franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a french port or border railway station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.     the french federation of non-ferrous metals groups various metal associations including the association of white metals.  reuter &#3;</h3>
