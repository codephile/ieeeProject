	<h3>british prime minister margaret thatcher has improved her standing with voters, according to the first opinion poll published since her return from the soviet union.     thatcher is seeking re-election for a third term and the newspaper said there would now be pressure on her to go for a june or even a may election to capitalise on her soviet trip.     the survey, by the harris research centre for today's london daily news, said more than half of the 767 voters polled by telephone believed she had improved the prospects of arms reductions and peace while 22 pct said they were more likely to vote for her now than before her visit.     the poll was bad news for labour opposition leader neil kinnock. it showed that his popularity had slumped following his trip to washington last week to explain his anti-nuclear policies. thirty five pct of those polled said their opinion of him had gone down since the trip and only 13 pct were more in favour of him.     in contrast, 46 pct said they were more impressed with thatcher after her trip to the soviet union. only 14 pct rated her less highly. reuter &#3;</h3>
