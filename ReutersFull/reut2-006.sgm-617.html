	<h3>sudan will find it difficult to meet scheduled debt repayments over the next five years, finance minister beshir omer has told parliament..     he said sudan's foreign debt rose to 10.6 billion dlrs at the end of last year, an increase of 300 mln from 1985.     omer said it "will be difficult, if not impossible" for sudan to pay a scheduled 4.17 billion dlrs in principal and interest payments over the next five years.     he said sudan had reached agreement with the soviet union and its east european allies to service half of its debts to them in commodities, with the rest in hard currency.     western diplomatic and official sources in khartoum say 32 pct of sudan's total foreign debt is to the soviet union, the eastern bloc and arab countries.     sudan is 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the international monetary fund (imf), which last year declared it ineligible for fresh loans.     the sources said sudan, hit by a slump in export earnings and remittances from expatriate workers, had an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next june 30.     sudan, its treasury depleted by nearly four years of civil war in the south and the aftermath of the devastating 1984-85 drought, has a budget deficit of 2.86 billion pounds this fiscal year.     diplomatic and official sources said sudan was now only servicing debts owed to creditors bound by regulations banning them from extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears.     they said these included the u.s. agency for international development, the world bank and its soft loan affiliate, the international development agency.     sudan reached a framework rescheduling agreement in 1984 with western government creditors of the paris club.     the sources said this pact was to have been followed by bilateral agreements, but fell through when khartoum became unable to service debts in 1985.     a bank of sudan (central bank) spokesman said last month khartoum was negotiating a freeze on interest payments with commercial banks, owed about two billion dlrs.     sudan has not received fresh loans since 1985 and the sources said it was only getting grants at present. hopes that foreign aid would finance 780 mln dlrs  of the 1.14 billion dlr budget deficit have been dashed, they added.     sudanese officials said prime minister sadeq al-mahdi's government would shortly announce a four-year economic plan aimed at starting the country's recovery.     details of the plan have not been made public. but the sources said it would be geared to generate agricultural exports and would need a substantial injection of fresh loans that sudan hoped to receive from gulf arab states.  reuter &#3;</h3>
