	<h3>japanese securities houses have asked the finance ministry again to consider introducing auctions of 10-year government bonds, securities sources said.     finance ministry officials declined comment but said the ministry has been aware of growing calls from securities houses for 10-year bond auctions.     japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers to underwrite more 10-year bonds from april. four u.s. banks are expected to receive finance ministry approval in late april to operate securities subsidiaries in japan as long as they hold no more than 50 pct of the capital, bankers said.     these firms are likely to join the syndicate, which will increase the number of participants in the 10-year government bond primary market, securities managers said.     each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the syndicate underwrites 0.07 pct of each issue, they said.     in order to expand participation by foreigners, the syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct share or introduce auctions to the primary market, they said.     local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate, now fuji bank ltd, to increase their share to 30.7 pct but banks oppose any cut in their 74 pct share, bankers said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
