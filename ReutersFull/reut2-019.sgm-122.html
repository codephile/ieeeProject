	<h3>pnc financial corp's provident national bank subsidiary said it is increasing the weighting of bonds in its investment portfolio due to the recent softening in the fixed-income markets.     the bank said it is shifting the debt to equity mix of its balanced portfolios to 45 pct bonds/55 pct stocks from 40/60 and reducing the equity segment's cash reserve to 25 pct from 30 pct.  it said "based on the continued high valuation level of the stock market, coupled with the recent temporary weakness in bond prices, the relative attractiveness of the bond market is now at its highest level in over 18 months."  reuter &#3;</h3>
