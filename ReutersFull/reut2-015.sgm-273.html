	<h3>caterpillar inc, in remarks delivered at its annual meeting in san francisco, reiterated its expectation of a loss in the first quarter.     it said results would be hurt by a 25 mln dlr one-time charge by caterpillar mitsubishi, a 50-pct owned affiliate. the company said it expected profit from operations for the full year to improve over 1986.     in remarks prepared for delivery to shareholders, president peter donis said caterpillar's targeted five pct cost reduction in 1987 "will be difficult to achieve because the weaker dollar has limited opportunities to obtain lower material costs."  reuter &#3;</h3>
