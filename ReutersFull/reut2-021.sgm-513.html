	<h3>king baudouin is expected to accept the resignation of belgian prime minister wilfried martens's centre-right coalition government after last-ditch talks failed to solve a language row, state-run rtbf radio said.     the king could ask martens or another political leader to put together a new government or to form a caretaker administration with elections at the end of november or in early december.     the king has so far withheld a decision on whether to accept the resignation last thursday of martens's coalition of dutch and french speaking parties over the linguistic conflict.      martens has used the breathing space to try to put together a compromise solution but rtbf and the belgian news agency belga said leading ministers ended their talks early on monday morning without agreement.     "the resignation of the government will no doubt be accepted by the king in the near future," rtbf said.     the king has no formal deadline for announcing his decision but has been widely expected to do so on monday.   reuter &#3;</h3>
