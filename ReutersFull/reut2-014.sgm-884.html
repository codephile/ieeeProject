	<h3>the outcome of today's european community (ec) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after last week's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest ever rebate of 46.864 european currency units (ecus) per 100 kilos, traders said.     some said they believed the tonnage would probably be smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view on the likely restitution. last week, the european commission accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators protesting about low rebates. this might be a determining factor in today's result, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
