	<h3>bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations.     sumita said the bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the february 22 paris agreement by six major industrial nations.     canada, britain, france, japan, the u.s. and west germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.     "it is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates," sumita said.     the fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said.     the six nations agreed in paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the paris statement said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
