	<h3>belgium's public expenditure deficit fell sharply to 59.5 billion francs in may from 96.7 billion in the same month last year, the first major sign of the effects of the government's public spending curbs, the budget ministry said.     during the first five months of this year, the net government financing requirement was down by 44.1 billion francs from year ago levels at 345.8 billion francs, it said in a statement.     the government is aiming to cut this year's financing requirement to below 420 billion francs this year from around 560 billion in 1986.     the ministry said it was expected that more than half the projected cut should have been achieved by the end of july.     ministry sources noted that for technical reasons, the financing requirement is always highest in the early months of the year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
