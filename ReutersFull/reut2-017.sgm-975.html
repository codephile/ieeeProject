	<h3>the world bank, in the throes of a painful reorganization, faces new strains because of actions by citibank and others to set aside new latin debt reserves, financial analysts and monetary sources said.     the monetary sources said the reorganization has caused some bad feelings and charges that promotions and other personnel actions have been based on personality rather than ability. it also had some effect in undermining the bank's role in the global debt strategy, the sources said.     at the center of the controversy is bank president barber conable, whose reorganization efforts are getting some  critical review from many bank staff members and some member- countries including the united states.     "i think if he were to do it again, he would do it very differently," said one source.     conable, a former congressman from new york appointed by president reagan to the senior most position at the bank nearly a year ago, has taken the view that the bank badly needed to be reorganized and perhaps made more streamlined.     in this he had the backing of many in the reagan administration who viewed the bank as a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-market sources of assistance were available.     however, the bank had been singled out for a much greater role under the u.s. debt initiative proposed by treasury secretary james baker.  that strategy, which called for some 20 billion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and nine billion dlrs in spending from the development banks, mostly the world bank, came under profound doubt with the decision by citibank and chase manhattan to set aside new reserves.     this move, heralded by some sources as a measure that gives all parties more time, frightened others, who see it as the beginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to complete unraveling of the monetary system.     as envisioned by the latter, the next move would be for brazil, which has delayed payments on its debts, to say it does not intend to pay interest for a very long period of time.     citibank and other banks could then decide to stop financing the country's export credits, the funds countries use to support their daily activities, leading to an economic breakdown.     "within six weeks alot of countries could be out of business," said one source.     citibank's initial step last month was to set some three billion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loans to developing countries.  it was followed by a similar move by chase manhattan some days later.     in the best of all worlds, the kind of cooperation that was demonstrated between the international monetary fund (imf), the multilateral development banks, the wealthy countries and commercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982, could emerge again but no one is expecting that.     if anything, the negotiations have become much more confrontational with the debtor countries pressing for more concessions, arguing that they face growing political instability if they are asked to do or pay more.     they are very critical of the imf's austerity measures and there is sympathy for their view among the development community.     "when you hear code words like structural adjustment and tightening your belt.  what that means is that the poor peasent making 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs," says one source.     he adds: "and when your hear they should have market forces at play, that means the level of public services should drop."     it had been hoped that giving the world bank a greater role in the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in the debtor countries to measures that increased already prevalent poverty even further.    the bank, which primarily assists countries in the building of roads, sewerage systems, education, and other so-called infrastructure, is viewed in the third world as benefactor.    the imf, however, which essentially forged the debt stategy following the disclosure by mexico in 1982 that it was near default, is considered a stern taskmaster that has little sympathy or even understanding of poverty.     but there are doubts about how well the baker initiative has worked and about the world bank's success at bringing about increased growth in the third world under the u.s. prescription which indicated that countries might grow their way out of their difficulty.  reuter &#3;</h3>
