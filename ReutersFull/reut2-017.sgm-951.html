	<h3>interest rates on kuwaiti dinar deposits held firm in scattered trading despite a central bank decision to revive limited funding lines, dealers said.     the central bank, which last tuesday shut a daily aid window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened the facility for three month money, which was available at seven pct, they said.     it offered one month funds at seven pct through swap facilities, dealers said.     today's central bank action, combined with sales of dollars by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the u.s. currency arising from attractive u.s. interest rates and gulf tension, dealers said.     however, as one dealer noted: "the market is still unsettled."     overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business, traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers down to 10 pct by the close. tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight.     spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids of 10. dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early 9-1/2, 7-1/2.     one month rates were at the same level after trade at eight then 8-1/2. dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. they reported offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close.      the central bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at 0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. the spot dinar was 0.27930/40.  reuter &#3;</h3>
