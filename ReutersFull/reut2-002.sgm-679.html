	<h3>the finance ministry said it set a price of 335 francs per investment certificate for a public offering of the state's rights to a 2.5 billion franc one-for-five rights issue of certificates by rhone-poulenc <rhon.pa> opening monday.     the price was based on a 12 billion franc minimum value set on rhone-poulenc by the independent privatisation committee established by the government to oversee its five-year privatisation programme, the ministry said.     a ministry statement said eight mln privileged investment certificates, a form of non-voting preference share, would be issued, equivalent to one certificate for every five existing shares.     it said 10 pct of the certificates would be reserved for rhone-poulenc employees at a preferential price, and 1.5 mln certificates would be placed on the u.s. market by a public offering.     about four mln certificates, the remainder of the state's rights entitlement to the issue, would be offered on the paris bourse on the basis of 20 francs per lot of five rights and 315 francs per new certificate, making a total 335 francs, it said.     rhone-poulenc is 88.39 pct state-owned.  reuter &#3;</h3>
