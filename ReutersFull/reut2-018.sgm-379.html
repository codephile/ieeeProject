	<h3>africa's efforts to revive its economy are not being matched by international help, two of the continent's heads of state said at the opening of a conference.     presidents ibrahim babangida of nigeria and denis sassou- nguesso of congo urged africa's development partners to act over the continent's debt, which now totals 175 billion dlrs, at a meeting organised by the economic commission for africa (eca).     their view was backed by monique landry, canada's minister for external relations. "whether we look at aid or debt or trade, the rich countries have not as yet lived up to their part of last year's economic recovery pact."     babangida said it was unrealistic to expect any country to spend more than 30 pct of its earnings on debt servicing particularly as prices for the continent's commodities were so unstable.     sassou nguesso, current chairman of the organisation of african unity, accused international aid donors of failing to provide the vigorous effort they promised a year ago.     the conference, attended by african ministers, economists and representatives from major donors, will review progress since both sides agreed at the u.n. last year to revive the african economy over five years.     the response from the international community has been negative and projections of improved growth rates for africa already look far too optimistic, eca executive secretary adebayo adedeji told the conference.     both babangida and sassou nguesso called for the debts of africa's poorest countries to be written off and for repayment and grace terms to be eased.     they won a degree of support from landry, "even private bankers are willing to talk about the need for longer term solutions to africa's debt."  reuter &#3;</h3>
