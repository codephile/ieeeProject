	<h3>the u.s. house agriculture committee approved proposals to extend the life of the export enhancement program, eep, through fiscal 1990 and urged the reagan administration offer eep wheat to the soviet union.     the proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through congress this year.     in addition to the amendments on eep, the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the house ways and means committee, which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them, congressional sources said.     the effect of the eep amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988.     the amendments, offered by rep. dan glickman, d-kan., also would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion now.     furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by rep. glickman which instructs the u.s. agriculture department to value eep bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition value. glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate.     the provision on eep wheat to the soviet union, offered by rep. bob smith, r-ore., does not require the administration make an offer, but urges such action.     the committee approved an amendment, offered by rep. glenn english, d-okla., requiring the secretary of agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.     trade representative clayton yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.     among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to u.s. quotas. the amendment, offered by rep. arlan stangeland, r-minn., is aimed primarily at curbing imports from canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products. it also may affect peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, committee sources said.     another amendment would place a quota on u.s. imports of casein, a dairy product shipped to the u.s. primarily by new zealand and ireland.     the panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for u.s. beef imports.     other miscellaneous amendments included:     -- urging the administration consider retaliating against japan and south korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports.     -- boosting the amount of u.s. grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called section 416 to 800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.     -- requiring the agriculture secretary conduct a study of the canadian wheat board import licensing system for wheat to determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.     -- requiring the agriculture secretary reimburse the national corn growers association up to 500,000 dlrs for the costs of defending the u.s. feedgrains program against a canadian countervailing duty case this year.     -- urging the administration oppose the canadian decision to apply a duty on u.s. corn imports, and a proposal by the european community to apply a vegetable oils tax.     -- usda conduct a study of the findings of a national commission on agricultural export policy, which recommended a reorganization of usda's trade policy apparatus.  reuter &#3;</h3>
