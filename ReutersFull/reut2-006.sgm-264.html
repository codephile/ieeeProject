	<h3>upcoming changes being considered in the u.s. agriculture department's transportation and loan programs were outlined by a usda official today.     addressing the annual meeting of the national grain and feed association, tom vongarlem, assistant deputy administrator for usda's state and county operations, said the following changes are under consideration by usda.     termination of usda's transportation assistance program for wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week.     changes in usda's reserve rotation program are also under consideration, vongarlem said. while the department has not made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.     changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates under consideration.     vangarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop program signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time.     he also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus under the conservation reserve program.  reuter &#3;</h3>
