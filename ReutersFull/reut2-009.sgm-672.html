	<h3>the united states remained isolated among the inter-american development bank's 44 members as the bank ended its annual meeting here today without agreement on u.s. proposals to reform the regional lending institution.     the three-day meeting was dominated by the dispute and by the failure of brazil and its creditor banks to make any breakthrough on debt talks after brasilia suspended interest payments last month.     brazil's central bank governor francisco gros said after talks with its 14-bank advisory committee here yesterday that it could not make a token interest payment now, as sought by banks, but would maintain contact with the banks.     delegates agreed to shelve discussion of iadb reforms until the half-yearly international monetary fund and world bank meetings in two weeks time in washington at which a decision will be urgently sought in order to maintain credit flows to the recession-hit region.     "the bank cannot maintain an adequate lending level unless it is given increased resources," iadb president antonio ortiz mena told a press conference.     ortiz mena said 42 countries opposed washington's proposal to lower veto power over loans to 35 pct of the bank's voting shares from a simple majority as at present.     u.s. treasury secretary james baker said monday the united states, as 34.5 pct shareholder and provider of the bulk of the bank's resources, should have more say in approving loans and conditioned a nine billion dlr increase in its contribution on approving the reforms.     but ortiz mena said latin america and the non-regional members including europe and japan had all supported a 40 pct veto level. canada declined to state a position.     behind the dispute was a u.s. attempt to radically change the direction of the bank, which has lent 35 billion dlrs to latin america in its 28 years, and give it a bigger role in the current debt strategy with increased lending but more stringent conditions attached.     but ortiz said the bank cannot divert too much of its resources to so-called sectoral lending, whereby loans to specific sectors are tied to economic reforms, because this could affect the bank's triple a rating as a borrower in world markets.     "for this reason we have agreed to limit sectoral loans to 25 pct of the total, leaving the rest for investment in projects," he said.     ortiz mena earlier told the bank's closing session that as a result of negotiations here, the bank can expect a new injection of about 25 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90.     the united states has said it will only be able to support a level close to the sixth replenishment of funds, which came to 15.7 billion dlrs, unless its proposals are accepted.     but despite the impasse, some latin american delegates including mexican finance minister gustavo petricioli said they were optimistic a compromise agreement could be reached next month.  reuter &#3;</h3>
