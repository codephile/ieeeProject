	<h3>the dutch finance ministry said it accepted bids totalling 3.25 billion guilders on its 6.25 pct bullet bond due 1995, which it priced at 100.8 pct at tender today for an effective yield of 6.12 pct.     the ministry accepted 50 pct of bids at the issue price. higher bids were met in full.     the loan, which has a may 1 coupon and paydate, will go towards the government's financing of an estimated 1987 borrowing requirement of about 42 billion guilders.     the 1987 budget deficit is some 29 billion guilders and early repayments on state loans are estimated at 13 billion.     because of projected early redemptions to the state of loans by building corporations, analysts predict the state has to raise 32 billion guilders on the capital markets this year, of which it has found 4.5 billion guilders on the private placement market.    the finance ministry described today's tender as successful and said the amount raised reflected a change in market circumstances since the last loan issue together with international demand for guilder-denominated paper.     following today's tender, the fourth state loan for payment in 1987, a nominal 10.55 billion guilders has been raised by public issues, bringing the total raised this year to 18.55 billion guilders, or some 44.2 pct of the state's 1987 borrowing requirement.     the previous state loan, a 6.25 pct issue due 1998/2002 last month, raised a mere 300 mln guilders.     analysts said the small amount raised on the last issue was because it was a return to a split maturity issue, seen as only attractive to domestic institutions, from bullet loans.     the finance ministry said then the amount was low but noted a number of unfavourable market conditions at the time.     bullet loans have only been permitted in the dutch market since january, 1986, as part of a financial liberalization plan.     bullet loans have attracted considerable foreign demand but have also given rise to worries their fixed repayment date might interfere with intricate redemption schemes built up around previously issued split maturity bonds, dealers said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
