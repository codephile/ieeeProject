	<h3>u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng said he was not sure a long-term u.s.-soviet grain agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.     "it hasn't been worth much in the last two years....they haven't lived up to the agreement as i see it," lyng said in an interview with reuters.     "it would be my thought that it's not worth any effort to work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to be a one-sided thing," he said.     however, lyng said he did not want to make a "definitive commitment one way or another at this point."     under the accord covering 1983-88, the soviets agreed to buy at least nine mln tonnes of u.s. grain, including four mln tonnes each of corn and wheat.     moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of wheat during the third agreement year, which ended last september, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.     lyng said he had no knowledge of how much u.s. grain moscow would buy this year.     "i've seen people making comments on that and i don't know how they know, unless they talk to the soviets," he said. "i have no knowledge, and i really don't think anyone other than the soviets have any knowledge."     lyng said he thought the soviets bought u.s. corn last month because "they needed it and because the price was right."     "our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. and i think they've always found that our corn was good," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
