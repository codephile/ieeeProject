	<h3>the canadian federal government is backing down on its plans to give vancouver and montreal special status as international banking centres, ontario's minister of financial institutions monte kwinter said.     he told journalists that little concrete activity had taken place since the announcement in february 1986 that the two cities would gain a special status, while toronto, despite its position as canada's main financial centre, would not.     "they (the federal government) have sent a confusing signal to world financial markets," kwinter said. "it was done for political reasons and it's going to backfire on them."  reuter &#3;</h3>
