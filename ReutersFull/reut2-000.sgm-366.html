	<h3>apple computer inc today will announce the addition of two new machines to its profitable macintosh line of personal computers, both aimed at the business market.     the macintosh was first introduced in january 1984 and has been upgraded several times since then. both of the new machines, the macintosh se and the macintosh ii, will be faster and more versatile, but considerably more expensive than earlier models.     the mac se (se stands for "system expansion"), which apple says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current mac plus, goes on sale today. it carries a suggested retail price ranging from 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features.     the mac ii, designed to run about four times faster than the mac plus, is to be ready for shipping in may and priced between 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs.     mac plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells for about 2,200 dlrs.     both new computers are to be unveiled at the appleworld conference in los angeles.     company officials expressed high hopes for both computers at a press briefing on friday, especially the high-performance mac ii which is designed to give apple an entree to the expanding market for science and engineering workstations.     john sculley, apple chairman and chief executive officer, declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the mac se should contribute significantly to apple's bottom line this year. he said it would appeal to the mainstream of pc users.     "i believe the mac se will be the product of choice for most people," he said. "my sense is that it will be a real power product for revenue."     bruce lupatkin, senior technology analyst with hambrecht & quist in san francisco, said he had not seen the new computers but expected the new products to do well.     "apple has recognized the need for a convergence of computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation," he told reuters. "the graphics interface on the mac products is significantly better than anything ibm has to date."     international business machines is expected to announce updated personal computers this spring.     the mac ii uses the new motorola 68020 microprocessor, an "open architecture" that allows for the addition of numerous peripheral devices, a built-in hard disk and one megabyte of memory, expandable to eight megabytes. it can be equipped with a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor.     in a demonstration of its speed and power, company executives said they thought the mac ii would push the development of software for apple computers in new directions that could include sophisticated video editing, electronic mail systems and sound reproduction suitable for studio use.     the mac ii can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256 colors or shades of gray.     the mac se is built around the 68000 microprocessor and will be shipped with one megabyte ram, expandable to four megabytes, and a nine-inch monochrome screen.     both new computers have two optional keyboards, a new feature in the apple line of products.            reuter &#3;</h3>
