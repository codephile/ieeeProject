	<h3>the bank of france said in its latest monthly report on the french economy it expected a pickup in industrial production registered in march to gather steam over the next few months.     without giving figures, the report said last month's rise, partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost earlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to a firming of domestic demand.     "new progress is expected in all main sectors except capital goods where production will remain at its present level," the report added.     the upbeat report comes in the wake of grim march trade balance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade for the first time since june 1982.     while the automobile industry remained unchanged from previously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic appliances. semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in all sectors. construction and civil engineering, boosted by a rise in public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in all sectors continued to slow.  reuter &#3;</h3>
