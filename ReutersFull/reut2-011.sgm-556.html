	<h3>royal dutch/shell said two groups of u.s. investors have requested a special shareholders meeting to discuss the company's presence in south africa.     but it said that a special meeting could only be held under dutch law if 10 pct of its shareholders agree.     two groups of u.s. investors, it said, have less than one pct of the outstanding shares in the company.     the groups are seeking a special meeting to call for an end to sales to the south african police and military, and withdrawal from south africa, it said.     royal dutch spokesman eric steneker told reuters shareholders were entitled to discuss any matter relating to shell at may's annual general meeting. "in fact, shell in south africa has been discussed at every meeting of shareholders for more than 10 years," steneker said.     representatives of american baptist churches and the new york city teachers retirement system said shell refused to discuss their proposals at the next meeting.     steneker said investors had ample opportunity to express  views and a majority supported the board's view that it should stay in south africa to act as a force for change.  reuter &#3;</h3>
