	<h3>the u.s. department of transportation (dot) has concluded that a ban on smoking on all domestic airline flights is not justified at this time.     the department made known its conclusions in a report to congress, made public today, on a recommendation by the national academy of sciences that such a ban be adopted.     "we agree that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could be viewed as a problem by some crew and passengers. however, we believe that further study is needed before the department can propose a definitive response to this recommendation," the dot report said.     the national academy of sciences (nas) had studied the issue of smoking on airlines under a dot grant.     it recommended a ban in august after concluding that tobacco smoke, when confined to an airliner's cabin, posed potential health hazards to cabin crew members, irritated  passengers and crew, and created a risk of fires.     the dot said more study was needed of the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke and of the concentration and distribution of pollutants on various aircraft types.     it also called for more study of possible changes in aircraft ventilation systems and said it wanted to spend more time considering whether a ban should be extended to  international as well as domestic flights.  reuter &#3;</h3>
