	<h3>french state agricultural bank <caisse nationale du credit agricole> has joined the group led by publishing house <hachette> which is bidding for control of the state television station tf1, replacing <banque nationale de paris> which has withdrawn, hachette said in a statement.     credit agricole's stake in the consortium will be 3.5 pct.     last week the broadcasting supervisory board asked hachette to remove bnp from the consortium because the bank had acted as adviser to the government for the imminent privatisation of tf1.  reuter &#3;</h3>
