	<h3>saudi arabia's crown prince abdullah bin abdul aziz met for an hour with vice president george bush on monday after u.s. naval forces destroyed one iranian oil platform in the gulf and raided another.     asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack, the crown prince, who is here on an official visit, replied, "i believe what the united states has done is their responsibility as a superpower."     his remark appeared to be an implicit endorsement of the u.s. action, which the pentagon said came in retaliation for last friday's iranian missile attack on a u.s.-flagged kuwaiti tanker.     administration officials said bush had assured the crown prince the united states would "stay the course" in the gulf.     they said prince abdullah, who is deputy prime minister of saudi arabia and commander of the kingdom's national guard, was "very supportive" of the u.s. role in the strategic waterway.     before meeting with bush, the crown prince paid a brief courtesy call on president reagan.     during his stay in washington, he was also scheduled to meet with deputy secretary of state john whitehead, defense secretary caspar weinberger and leaders of the house and senate foreign policy committees.  reuter &#3;</h3>
