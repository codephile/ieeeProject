	<h3>french household consumption of industrial goods fell 1.1 pct seasonally adjusted to 21.32 billion francs last month from 21.55 billion in january, the national statistics institute (insee) said.     this brought consumption back down to the december 1986 level, it added.     insee said that the fall was due to a sharp decline in purchases of clothing, which were high in january due to the cold weather. the decline was partly compensated by a small rise in purchases of durable goods.  reuter &#3;</h3>
