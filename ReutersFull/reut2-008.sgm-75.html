	<h3>president jose sarney, whose handling of the economy is under attack at home and abroad, has held private talks with brazilian business leaders worried that government policies are leading to recession.     over an informal barbecue at a farm outside sao paulo owned by millionaire entrepreneur matias machline, sarney met more than 20 businessmen for discussion on brazil's economic crisis.     business leaders said before the meeting they would be pressing for less government interference in what they describe as a tightly regulated economy.     their concerns include the country's high rates of interest and tough restrictions on imports.     machline, president of the sharp electronics group and a personal friend of sarney's, told television reporters outside his farm that he wanted "less government participation in the economy."     when the government announced a month ago that it was suspending interest payments on brazil's 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks, it said this was a means of ensuring growth and avoiding recession.     but business leaders and economic analysts say there are growing signs that brazil's economy, the eighth biggest in the non-communist world, is heading for a downturn after 8 pct growth last year.     businessmen are deeply concerned about the effect on industry of import restrictions introduced earlier this year because of the country's deteriorating trade balance.     cacex, the foreign trade department of the federally owned banco do brasil, has told companies they must limit their imports to 90 pct of what they imported in 1985.     business sources say that in practice importing even this amount is difficult and they have to haggle with cacex on a case-by-case basis.     the business daily gazeta mercantil reported that in many sectors of the economy there was a real fear that production lines would grind to a halt next month.     one of those attending the talks was mario amato, head of the powerful sao paulo state industries' federation (fiesp).     business sources said he would argue that unless there were a relaxation in import controls a sharp downturn in industrial activity was inevitable.     relations between sarney and the business community have at times been strained and the existence of these tensions pointed up the importance of the meeting.     in one bizarre dispute in january, sarney surprised brazilian business leaders by declaring that they were allies of the 19th century anarchist mikhail bakunin. this outburst came after amato warned that companies might start disobeying government regulations on price controls.     brazilian press reports made much of the fact that finance minister dilson funaro, chief architect of the government's economic policy, had not been invited to the gathering.  reuter &#3;</h3>
