	<h3>soviet imports of soymeal may reach or exceed one mln tonnes between january and september this year, the oil world newsletter said.     oil world said it was likely the soviet union would reduce soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.     at least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the european community and south america in the january/march quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported in the april and july quarters from argentina and brazil, it said. no figures were given for imports in the corresponding periods of 1986.     the change made sense in view of the recent purchases of probably 250,000 tonnes of west european and polish rapeseed and large scale butter imports that were expected from march onward, it said.     oil world said substantial losses of soviet winter grain area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the recent pick-up in soviet purchases of u.s. corn.     it noted that an additional one mln tonnes of u.s. corn had been bought recently by the soviet union.  reuter &#3;</h3>
