	<h3>noranda inc said 1,100 unionized workers at its 63 pct-owned brunswick mining and smelter corp lead-zinc mine in new brunswick would start voting monday on a tentative contract pact.     company official andre fortier said "we are hopeful that we can settle without any kind of work interruption."     fortier added that brunswick's estimated 500 unionized smelter workers were currently meeting about a noranda contract proposal and would probably vote next week. the mine's contract expires july 1 and the smelter's on july 21.     the brunswick mine produced 413,800 tonnes of zinc and 206,000 tonnes of lead last year at a recovery rate of 70.5 pct zinc and 55.6 pct lead. concentrates produced were 238,000 tonnes of zinc and 81,000 tonnes of lead.  reuter &#3;</h3>
