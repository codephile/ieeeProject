	<h3>the european community commission said it had approved the creation of himont, a company in which montedison spa <moni.mi> of italy and hercules inc <hpc.n) are major shareholders, after requesting changes in the two partners' plans for the venture.     twenty pct of the capital of himont, in which montedison and hercules originally planned to take 50 pct stakes, has been floated publicly and marketing and production agreements have been modified on the commission's advice, it said.     himont, which is incorporated in the u.s., groups the two firms' assets in the polypropylene sector.     the modified agreements include the abandoning by hercules and montedison of all their direct activities within the ec in the downstream market of himont.     the ec authority said the modifications meant that the creation of himont did not appear to lead to restrictive coordination of activities between hercules and montedison, nor did their respective market shares give them a dominant position.     the commission must approve such link-ups between competitors under ec competition rules.  reuter &#3;</h3>
