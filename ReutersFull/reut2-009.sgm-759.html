	<h3>world group turnover of siemens ag <sieg.f> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current year to september 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five months, management board chairman karlheinz kaske said.     siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02 billion marks.     kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to 21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about 19 pct above the same year-ago period. the rise was mainly due to payment in january for a west german nuclear power station which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.     in the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a three pct increase, kaske said, without giving figures.     in the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8 billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.     for the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.     apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year, kaske said.     but it was not possible to make a profit forecast for 1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar, kaske said.     siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the same period in the previous year.     turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology, communications and telecommunications sectors, but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.     kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned kraftwerk union ag subsidiary.     foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. an increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar.     while the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of 1985/86.     telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level.     kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous year. research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to 6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.  reuter &#3;</h3>
