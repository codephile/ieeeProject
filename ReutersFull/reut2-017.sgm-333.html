	<h3>the supreme court refused to dismiss a justice department civil suit charging archer daniels midland co, adm, and nabisco brands inc with violating the antitrust laws.     the high court let stand lower court rulings that rejected the motion by the two companies seeking dismissal of the suit.     the suit challenged the 1982 agreement by nabisco to lease both of its high fructose corn syrup, hfcs, plants to adm.     the department said that before 1982 adm was the second largest u.s. producer of hfcs while nabisco ranked third. the deal made adm the nation's largest producer.  reuter &#3;</h3>
