	<h3>house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski said he was ready to support an 18 billion dlr tax increase to help balance the budget but doubted it could pass congress without president reagan's support.     rostenkowski, the chief house taxwriter, said his committee was reluctant to back a tax increase without certainty that it would pass the full house and this would require republican votes.     "chairman rostenkowski still says its an uphill fight unless the president signs on," the illinois democrat said in remarks for delivery to the tax executives institute.     rostenkowski predicted the tax increase will concentrate on increases in federal excise taxes while leaving the income tax intact.     the taxwriters will not consider delaying the income tax rate cuts for upper income persons scheduled to take effect in 1988, he said. the top rate will fall from 38.5 pct to 28 pct next year.     in addition, he said "they don't have the energy or appetite to endorse a radical new tax like a vat (value added tax)," which he also opposes. "the real question is where the republicans will be when the tough vote comes," he said.     rostenkowski said his committee will not approve any tax credits to provide incentives for exports as part of a tax or trade bill this year.     he added that no extension or expansion of the research and development tax credit for business is expected since it would cost billions of dollars.     and, rostenkowski told the tax executives that howard baker as reagan's chief of staff would make it more likely the white house will ultimately back a tax increase this year. "there are strong suspicions that the baker boys will lead the president down the slippery slope of moderation," he said.   reuter &#3;</h3>
