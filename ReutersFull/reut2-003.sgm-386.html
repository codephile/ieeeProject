	<h3>(warrington inc) said it sold its shoe divisions to montreal-based (taurus footwear inc) for undisclosed terms.     the divisions manufacture and distribute greb, hush puppies, kodiak, and santana brand shoes and had revenues of about 69 mln dlrs last year, warrington said. it said the sale of the shoe divisions and the previous sale of its ski boot businesses will result in an unspecified net gain.     warrington said it plans to concentrate on its canstar sports group inc skate and athletic footwear division, the largest ice skate manufacturer and distributor in the western world.     warrington said it decided to rationalize the balance of its ski businesses, which is expected to result in a divestment loss which could outweigh the net gains on the sales of its shoe and ski boot divisions.     taurus said the acquisition is expected to increase its annual sales to about 100 mln dlrs and make it canada's largest footwear manufacturer.  reuter &#3;</h3>
