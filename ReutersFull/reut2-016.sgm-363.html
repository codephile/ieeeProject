	<h3>great lakes forest products ltd said it plans a 390 mln dlr modernization and expansion of its fine paper and newsprint operations in northwestern ontario over the next five years.     it will install a 175 mln dlr fine paper machine at dryden and a 215 mln dlr newsprint machine at thunder bay to replace two aging machines. the dryden machine will have capacity to produce 175,000 metric tons of fine papers annually when it starts up in the 1989 third quarter, while the thunder bay machine will have design capacity of 240,000 metric tons annually and is expected to be in operation by early 1991.     great lakes said it expects to pay for the program mainly with internally generated cash flow, but external financing will be available to support peak spending periods.     it said the expansion's effect on company employment levels will be minimal.     great lakes said a decision on a joint venture with five publisher-partners to construct a newsprint mill in northeastern washington state should be coming from the partners in the near future. great lakes' capital investment in this project would be about 60 mln dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
