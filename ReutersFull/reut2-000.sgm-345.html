	<h3>the european community commission said it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the soviet union is dumping mercury on the european market at below-cost prices.     the commission said its decision follows a complaint from ec non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the european industry.     according to the complaint, soviet mercury sales in the ec had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between august and october last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the ec market if they continue at the same pace.     the industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by ec producers, forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. the imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.     the commission said the industry would probably be unable to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would result in loss of sales and jobs.     the so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the commission will allow all interested parties to state their cases to the authority.  reuter &#3;</h3>
