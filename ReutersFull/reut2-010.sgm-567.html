	<h3>the philippines has reached agreement with its bank advisory committee on a debt-rescheduling agreement after four weeks of talks, a source close to the philippine delegation said.     no details were available and bankers were not available to comment because meetings with the philippine negotiators were still in progress.     but a spokesman for manufacturers hanover trust co, which chairs the 12-bank philippine advisory committee, said a press conference with finance minister jaime ongpin will begin at the bank's headquarters at 1430 est/1930 gmt.     "there is an agreement," the source close to the philippine delegation said, adding that details would be announced at the press conference.     manila wants to reschedule about 3.6 billion dlrs of debt that falls due between 1987 and 1992 and to obtain easier terms on 5.8 billion dlrs of previously restructured debt.     the talks have dragged on because of the banks' reluctance to accept interest payments partly in philippine investment notes, pins, instead of cash and because of manila's insistence on an interest rate margin close to the 5/8 pct spread over eurocurrency rates that it initially demanded.  reuter &#3;</h3>
