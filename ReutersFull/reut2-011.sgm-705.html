	<h3>the u.s. specialty steel industry and its union said they will seek a three-year extension of president reagan's import restraint program to give the industry more time to restore competitiveness.     they said they will tell the u.s. international trade commission (itc) thursday that "termination will have disastrous consequences for american companies and workers."     the current four-year voluntary program reached with foreign exporters ends this summer and the itc must advise president reagan on the economic effect of its termination.     the specialty steel industry of the united states and the united steelworkers union said in statement that imported steel was still flooding the domestic market and continued curbs were needed to restore the industry's health.     reagan is to decide by july 19 whether to renew the restraint program.  reuter &#3;</h3>
