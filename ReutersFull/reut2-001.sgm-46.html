	<h3>pharmacia ab <phab st> forecast earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs 821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained at their present parities.     sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.     a weakening dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements.     last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.     the company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over.     the accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.     pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations, mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in lkb-produkter ab and the assets of intermedics-intraocular inc.  reuter &#3;</h3>
