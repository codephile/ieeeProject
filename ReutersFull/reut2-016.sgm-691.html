	<h3><medizone international inc> said it expects the food and drug administration to soon approve the company's application to begin limited tests of its potential therapy against aids using a combination of ozone and oxygen.     the company said that once it receives fda approval, 20 patients with aids-related complex will start the treatment at mount sinai medical center in new york.     dr joseph latino, director of research at medizone said the therapy, which he likened to a process, uses a combination of oxygen and ozone injected into a patient's owns blood outside of the body, and then reinfused back into the body.     "we are guardedly optimistic that this treatment may work," said latino, who said the process has been used to treat viral illneses, including aids, in europe with varying degrees of success.     he said ozone can kill viruses and is used to kill viruses in waste water treatments. he said the treatment should not be compared to inhaling ozone, which is toxic.    latino said the company is prepared to fund the trial, which will cost about 250,000 dlrs.      reuter &#3;</h3>
