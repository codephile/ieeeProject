	<h3>zimbabwe's real gross domestic product increased 0.2 pct in 1986, according to preliminary figures published by the central statistical office (cso). this contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.     the main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was a drop in the real value of agricultural output. this declined 12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous year. mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing production increased 1.4 pct.     the cso said that at current prices gdp rose 12.7 pct to 8.2 billion zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the gdp deflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually no growth in real output during 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
