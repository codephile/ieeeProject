	<h3>iraqi foreign minister tareq aziz was quoted as saying iran has attacked several ships with land-based missiles sited at the strait of hormuz.     the u.s. announced recently iran had emplaced chinese-made "silkworm" anti-ship missiles with the range to cover the entire width of the 24-mile-wide strait at the gulf's mouth.     aziz said in an interview with al-thawra newspaper that leaders of gulf arab states had told him of the existence of the missiles, which he said had been in place for many months.     "they briefed me with their details and we know that the iranians used them several times to attack ships belonging to arab states in the gulf, sailing in the waterway," he said.     this is the first time any person of authority has said iran, iraq's enemy in the 6-1/2-year-old gulf war, had fired the missiles in anger.     a british naval source in the gulf said last week iran had fired one test missile against a hulk in the strait.     about 120 ships have been attacked in the gulf by both belligerents since january last year.     aziz said the u.s. had announced the existence of the missiles so late after their arrival as part of its efforts to neutralise the effects of the secret u.s. arms sale to iran.     "the missiles existed in the gulf for many months ... but they became a serious topic for america and the west only after the failure of the iranian invasion plan (against the south iraqi city of basra) and as a balloon to cover up the irangate story," aziz said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
