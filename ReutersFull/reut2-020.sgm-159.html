	<h3>shearson lehman brothers holdings inc said the recent decline in equities has had a dislocating effect on the market but no impact on the company's financial condition.     the company reported a drop in third quarter profits to 51 mln dlrs from 65 mln dlrs on increased revenues of 1.3 billion dlrs compared to 1.1 billion a year earlier.
