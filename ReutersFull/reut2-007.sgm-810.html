	<h3>a single purpose company, <italfunding ltd>, has been created for the purpose of obtaining funds on the international capital markets to refinance 44.3 mln dlrs of mexico's official debt to italy at very attractive rates, morgan grenfell and co ltd said as lead manager and arranger.     the transaction will be accomplished by italfunding obtaining a 44.3 mln dlr euronote facility in the market and then using the proceeds to provide a loan for the same amount to mexico. the loan will be 100 pct guaranteed by sace, the official italian export credit agency.     morgan grenfell has used special purpose vehicles in the past to help refinance export credits for other indebted countries, such as brazil and ecuador.     the brazil financing, for example, involved the use of a floating rate note. this transaction makes use of another sector of the capital markets -- that for short-term note facilities -- to finance a medium term credit.     the financing is being arranged in connection with a bilateral agreement between mexico and sace earlier this year to refinance mexico's official debt to italy.     the bilateral accord followed a multilateral rescheduling agreement reached last september of mexico's official debt to the paris club of western creditor governments.     the paris club accord, in turn, was part of a broad-based rescheduling package covering 77 billion dlrs of mexico's foreign debt.     that package -- heralded as the first to incorporate all aspects of u.s. treasury secretary james baker's plan to aid indebted countries -- included a 7.7 billion dlr loan, which was signed today in new york.      the new financing for italfunding, being syndicated among about five major international banks, will be a fully underwritten, revolving facility with an average life of seven years and the facility will fund the loan.     all paris club agreements contain a generally accepted outline for a rescheduling, but the specific terms must then be negotiated on a bilateral basis.     banking sources noted that the use of a special-purpose vehicle will provide mexico with particularly attractive financing at a rate of about 1/4 to 1/2 pct over the london interbank offered rate (libor).     the cost of the new financing compares with a spread of 13/16 pct on the loans in the new commercial bank package.     this is because the intermediary providing the funds, in this case italfunding, can obtain its funds relatively cheaply on the international markets. at the same time, the deal benefits the banks, which will still get a reasonable return on the note facility, which is pure italian risk.     the bankers noted that if the financing had been arranged in italy, the cost to mexico and the italian banks would have been higher since the italian banks would use a different source of funding.  reuter &#3;</h3>
