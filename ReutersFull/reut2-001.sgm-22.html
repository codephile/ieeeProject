	<h3>commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said after the release of a sharply lower january leading indicator index that a pickup in exports is needed.     "the best tonic for the economy now would be a pickup in net exports," he said in a statement after the department reported the index fell 1.0 pct in january from december, the sharpest drop since a 1.7 pct fall in july, 1984.     the main reasons for the january decline after a 2.3 pct december rise were declines in building permits, new orders for plant and equipment and for consumer and industrial goods.  reuter &#3;</h3>
