	<h3>taiwan imposed currency controls today in what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation as the taiwan dollar appreciated against the u.s. currency.     the strict controls will require proof that large remittances to taiwan are connected to commercial transactions rather than currency speculation.     bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they were a panic reaction to pressure from washington for faster appreciation of the taiwan currency against the u.s. dollar, which would slow exports to the united states.     remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports, shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government approval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source.  reuter &#3;</h3>
