	<h3>littlefield, adams and co said it is attempting to work out new financing arrangements with lender congress financial, and unless it receives an extension of its loan to at least year-end, it expects a qualified audit opinion on 1986 financial statements.     the company said the revolving loan fell due at the end of february, and congress has so far granted two one-month extensions.  it said it has asked the securities and exchange commission and american stock exchange for an extension in filing 1986 annual reports while it tries to work out the new funding.     the company also said its collegiate pacific subsidiary has closed its gardena, calif., plant and leased the facility and equipment to a non-competing seller of printed wearables. it said it has licensed newly-formed collegiate pacific west to distribute collegiate pacific branded merchandise in 14 western states, western canada and japan.     it said the leasing and licensing agreements should provide about 200,000 dlrs in revenues a year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
