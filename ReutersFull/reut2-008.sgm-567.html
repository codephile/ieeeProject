	<h3>the treasury said it was modifying its computerized coupons under book-entry safekeeping (cubes) program by permitting on-line transfers of funds against payment by deposit-taking institutions.     each institution will be able to keep a cubes account at its local federal reserve bank or a branch and through it handle trading nationwide, a treasury release said.     the new system is expected to be in operation late this year.     currently, cubes accounts are maintained off-line at the federal reserve bank of new york, the treasury said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
