	<h3>federal reserve board vice chairman manuel johnson said that some u.s. banks have been too rigid in talks with lesser developed countries on debt refinancings and warned that a breakdown of the renegotiation process could be harmful.     "there have been some difficulties in those negotiations ... banks have sometimes been too rigid," johnson said in response to a question during an address before the eastern economic association, an academic group.     "i think there have been potential breakdowns in that process," he said, adding that an actual breakdown "would be very unfortunate."     he declined to comment on the situation of specific nations and said it was not the fed's role to become involved in such talks.     however, he said it was "always a little bit risky" for a heavily indebted nation to seek refinancing without first negotiating with the international monetary fund on economic reforms. he added that he remains optimistic that current talks would be resolved successfully.  reuter &#3;</h3>
