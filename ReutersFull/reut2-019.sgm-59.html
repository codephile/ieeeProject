	<h3>boeing co <ba> said in a statement it has yet to see the official japanese government report on the crash of a japan air lines (jal) boeing 747 in which 520 died.     however, it said it had agreed with an earlier draft report that the accident was caused by incorrect repairs which remained undetected during scheduled inspections.     the final report, released today, said faulty repairs to the plane in 1978 by boeing and inadequate inspection by transport ministry inspectors caused the 1985 crash, the worst single air disaster in aviation history.     boeing said it did not believe a similar accident could occur under any foreseeable operating conditions but said it had made tests and provided equipment for new planes and for planes already in service to ensure it could not happen again.  reuter &#3;</h3>
