	<h3>abnormally high levels of radiation were found in soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months after the chernobyl nuclear accident, west german residents in moscow were advised this week.     in a letter to the west german community here, ambassador joerg kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought in moscow in february had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and -137 in tea from azerbaijan and ukrainian hazelnuts.     other food samples sent for testing at cologne university, including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, were found to be free of radiation, it said.     data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts contained caesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by the united nations food and agriculture organisation (fao).     the letter said people who had consumed the tea faced no particular health danger as most of the caesium remained in the tea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts.     the products sent for testing were bought in state shops and private farmers' markets in moscow, it added. other western embassies in moscow said they had discontinued laboratory testing of soviet food late last year because no abnormal radiation levels were detected.     "we didn't find anything so we stopped doing it," a u.s. embassy spokesman said.     a british spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipment remained in the embassy waiting room for british residents in moscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests had not been conducted for several months.     "earlier we sent some food back to britain as a precautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of any alarming signals," he said. "if the tests had shown abnormal readings, they would have been resumed."  reuter &#3;</h3>
