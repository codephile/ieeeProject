	<h3>bilfinger und berger-bau ag <gbfg.f> expects group construction output in 1987 to fall to around 2.5 billion marks in 1987 from 2.73 billion last year and sees foreign business stabilizing just under its 1986 level.     in a letter to shareholders, bilfinger und berger said foreign construction work fell to 1.37 billion marks in 1986 from 2.10 billion the year before. it said the drop was due to a fall in orders and the dollar's decline against the mark.     the firm expects good 1986 results, with an appropriate dividend. in 1985 group net profit fell to 14.1 mln marks from 22.6 mln in 1984 and the dividend lost one mark to nine marks.     bilfinger und berger's u.s. units took up 600 mln marks of its total foreign construction output.     the company said domestic earnings in 1986 improved slightly despite strong competition, due to efforts to avoid taking on orders which would not break even.     foreign earnings were hit by the lower dollar and temporary payment difficulties by clients.     incoming orders in 1986 rose to 3.05 billion marks from 2.58 billion the year before, comprising domestic 1.30 billion marks versus 1.41 billion and foreign 1.75 billion marks versus 1.18 billion.     foreign incoming orders rose despite economic difficulties in developing countries and opec nations hit by lower oil prices, bilfinger und berger said.     in 1986 it won new orders in the u.s., pakistan, nigeria and egypt.     orders on hand at end-1986 totalled 3.64 billion marks against 3.32 billion at end-1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
