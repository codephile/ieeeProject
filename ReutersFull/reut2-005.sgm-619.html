	<h3>seven oaks international inc said it has formed a new 80 pct owned subsidiary called seven oaks direct inc to offer a full line of telemarketing services.     it said seven oaks direct management will own the remaining 20 pct.     the company said initial costs connected with the startupo of a new memphis, tenn., marketing center for seven oaks direct may hurt earnings slightly in the first half of the year ending in april 1988, but seven oaks direct should operate at no worse than breakeven for fiscal 1988 as a whole.  reuter &#3;</h3>
