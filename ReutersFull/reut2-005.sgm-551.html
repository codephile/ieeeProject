	<h3><onyx petroleum exploration co ltd>, earlier reporting a 1986 net loss against year-ago profit, said it converted 7,344,000 dlrs of its 11 pct convertible debentures into 2,824,611 common shares.     the conversion eliminates its obligation to pay principal amount due 1993 on the debentures and will increase cash flow through an interest saving of more than 800,000 dlrs a year, the company said.     onyx earlier reported a 1986 net loss of 10.6 mln dlrs, after a 10.3 mln dlr writedown on oil and gas property values, compared to a 1.3 mln dlr profit in the prior year.     onyx also said the company is a 37.5 pct partner with westcoast petroleum ltd in a new oil well drilled in otter/ogston area of central alberta that tested at rates of more than 1,000 barrels a day from the granite wash formation.     well production will be royalty free for five years, with initial allowable rates expected to be in the range of 150 barrels a day, the company said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
