	<h3>the u.s. commodity futures trading commission (cftc) released guidelines on how commodity trading advisors (cta) should calculate "beginning net asset value" (bnav) for purposes of computing rates of return required by commission disclosure rules.     the commission said it was compelled to release the guidelines because it has received disclosure documents which indicate "serious differences" in the way certain ctas are defining bnaw -- "differences that may have compromised the ability to compare rates of return among different advisors."     cftc said ctas must only use funds under their control or in conjunction with their carrying futures commission merchants in calculating bnav.     computation of bnav must exclude any item that is not money, securities or other tangible property and any funds that are not under the control of the cta, or cta in conjunction with its carrying futures commission merchant.     cftc said "notational" funds must be excluded because they are merely verbal promises to furnish funds.     funds in a commodity trading account over which a cta has discretionary trading authority must be included, cftc said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
