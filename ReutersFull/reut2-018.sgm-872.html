	<h3>the west texas cotton crop was largely unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts said.     "there might have been some isolated storms, but certainly nothing damaging," said charles stichler, an extension agronomist with the agricultural extension service in far west texas.     rumors of a damaging storm in west texas helped the new york cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.    cotton for december delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95 cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25 cents.     "what happened is that the storm hit lubbock airport, and when that happens, everybody sees it," said dale mohler, a senior meteorologist with accu-weather inc.     lubbock is the heart of the west texas cotton region, which produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.     the storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "that's hurricane force. but they were isolated to just a small portion of the west texas area, probably less than five pct," mohler said.     "no doubt there was some damage. but if it had hit in july or august (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been worse," mohler said.     about 60 pct of the west texas cotton crop has been planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if weather remains hot and dry, stichler said.     the temperature in west texas since mid-week has been about 95 degrees. but a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
