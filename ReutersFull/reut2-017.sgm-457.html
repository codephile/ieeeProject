	<h3>venezuela has no plans to try to renegotiate the debt rescheduling agreement it worked out with creditor banks in february, public finance director jorge marcano told reuters.     speaking here after a meeting of the 11-nation cartagena group, marcano said he was aware of political pressure at home to reduce debt payments but did not think such a move would benefit venezuela.     "we have no intention of revising the terms of the accord," he said. "there would be little to gain and in fact it would probably be detrimental."     venezuela agreed with its bank advisory committee on a 14.5 year rescheduling of 20.3 billion dlrs in public sector foreign debt, with an interest rate 7/8 pct over libor. the previous agreement, reached a year before but never implemented, was for 12-1/2 years with a 1-1/8 pct spread.     in caracas there have recently been calls to invoke the agreement's contingency clause which the government used last year to amend the original terms after a 40 pct drop in oil income.     but marcano said the bulk of payments to be made this year are on private debts and non-rescheduled public debts.     marcano said venezuela, which has reduced its debt by six billion dlrs since 1983, should have no problems in repaying restructured debt this year or next.     asked whether the government felt badly treated with its 7/8 pct spread when mexico and argentina have won a 13/16 pct margin, marcano said he still felt venezuela had a good deal.     "venezuela has restructured its debt so that most of it is being repaid at 7/8 pct, which i think is better than the other countries," he said. the rescheduling accord covers some 90 pct of venezuela's commercial bank debt, which accounts for more than 90 pct of the total public sector external debt.     venezuela has almost no debt outstanding to multilateral agencies.     marcano said attempting to revise the rescheduling accord a second time would probably hurt venezuela's bid to restore it credit rating and raise new loans.     he said venezuela now obtains trade credit lines without a government guarantee, something that argentina and others are just starting to try to negotiate in their restructuring packages.     venezuela is currently seeking loans in japan and west germany to finance steel and aluminium expansion.     according to finance minister manuel azpurua, a 100 mln mark credit has been lined up for the venalum aluminium plant.     marcano said no mandate has yet been given for a planned 100 mln dlr bond issue, although he confirmed that talks were continuing with morgan guaranty and other banks.     banking sources said one option was to privately place the bonds through the caracas-based banco de venezuela, which would underwrite the issue, but marcano said no decision has yet been made.  reuter &#3;</h3>
