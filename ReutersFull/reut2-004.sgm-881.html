	<h3>u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter said that whether the exchange rate of the dollar would fall or rise in the coming decade would depend on nations' financial, monetary and tax policies.     but, he said, in a speech and remarks to the heritage foundation, that in the end "the marketplace will ultimately rule the day."     asked about the future of the dollar, he said that whether or not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies and coooperation among trading nations.     yeutter said "if nations do the right kinds of things in financial, monetary and tax policies, then a lesser burden of adjustment is placed on exchange rates, and one could envision a situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer to what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange rates becoming relatively stable."     but he said, on the other hand, that if nations did not exhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation, "it is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make that adjustment."  reuter &#3;</h3>
