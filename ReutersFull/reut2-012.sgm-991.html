	<h3>noranda inc said production will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper mine here until it can completely examine the mine.     if it decides to keep the mine open it would take four or five months before it could resume full production.     company spokesman dale coffin said the investigation could take from a few days to several weeks but would not be more specific.     noranda said when it resumes production it plans to operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 tonnes annual finished capacity.     the fire, which started wednesday and burned itself out late yesterday weakened part of the mine's support structure, coffin said.     one miner was killed and 56 others were trapped underground for about 24 hours before being brought safely out.  reuter &#3;</h3>
