	<h3>over-investment and over-production are at the root of many of the difficult trade issues that have soured relations between the united states and some of its major trading partners, trade representative clayton yeutter said.     he told a conference, held by the university of chicago's graduate business school, that much of this was caused by governments "getting their finger in the pot."     yeutter referred specifically to the problems of agricultural trade, where subsidized exports have been a point of contention most notably between the united states and the european community.     "think of the vast waste of financial and other resources," he said.     yeutter said much of the problem underlying the dispute with japan over semiconductors was due to overproduction.     the trade representative called for a long-term approach to international trade and said the recent commitment to a free-trade agreement between the united states and canada was a step in the right direction.     there's a lot of work to be done in the next six months, but we have set october 1 as a target date for an agreement to be reached, he added.     "we're trying to create an environment that will facilitate and foster free and open trade in the world," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
