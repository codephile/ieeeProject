	<h3>the borrowing limit of the hong kong exchange fund, set up to regulate the value of the hong kong dollar, has been raised to 50 billion h.k. dlrs from 30 billion by the legislature, an official statement said.     the limit governs total borrowing by the fund from the government's general revenue account and various funds as well as borrowing by the fund arising from money market operations.     the bulk of the government's fiscal surplus is invested by the treasury with the exchange fund against the issue by the fund of interest-bearing debt certificates, financial secretary piers jacobs said.     "at the close of the business today, the total amount of debt certificates issued by the exchange fund in return for money transferred from the general revenue account and the various funds, in other words the total borrowing by the exchange fund from these sources, will be 26.9 billion dlrs," jacobs said.     he said borrowing arising from money market operations would amount to an additional 2.9 billion dlrs, making a total of 29.8 billion dlrs, just short of the borrowing limit of 30 billion dlrs.     jacobs said the government's fiscal reserves are expected to total 32 billion dlrs by the end of the current fiscal year ending march 31.     "the current borrowing limit of 30 billion dlrs will, therefore, constrain the ability of the exchange fund to continue to take in these fiscal reserves by the issue of interest-bearing debt certificates," he said.     "it will also constrain the ability of the exchange fund in its money market operations," he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
