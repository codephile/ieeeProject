	<h3>australia's minister for trade negotiations is optimistic that progress is possible on reducing the large subsidies which the european community and united states grant their farmers.     michael duffy said a european commission scheme to reform the ec common agricultural policy and u.s. plans to eliminate farm subsidies over 10 years are steps in the right direction.     "i am hopefully optimistic... there is goodwill in agricultural reform being shown by the usa, the ec and the cairns group," he told reporters.     duffy said the cairns group of 14 agricultural and commodity producers is on the verge of agreeing a common position for forthcoming general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) talks on farm subsidies.     the group, which includes australia and malaysia, advocates free farm trade and says u.s., european and japanese subsidies are stopping it competing in its traditional markets.     duffy is on a two-day visit to malaysia after talks in north and south america, the ec and thailand, and leaves for indonesia on wednesday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
