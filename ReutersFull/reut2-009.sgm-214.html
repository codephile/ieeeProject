	<h3>brazil and its bank advisory committee agreed to transmit a request for an extension of short-term credit lines totaling 16 billion dlrs for 60 days until may 31, brazilian central bank president francisco gros said.     speaking after talks with the committee here, gros also said he did not expect to make interest payment to the banks at this moment.     he added that "no one should expect any dramatic developments before march 31."     brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze short-term trade and money market lines.     bankers said they would relay the brazilian request for an extension but declined to say whether they were specifically endorsing it.     gros said the decision, which he called a "standstill" arrangement, will be communicated to brazil's 700 bank creditors by telex tomorrow. banks had been pressing brazil to make at least a token interest payment, but gros said the government was unable to comply for the moment.     he stressed however that brazil was willing to pay as soon as it could, but added that a payment of interest was not connected with the extension of the credit lines.     "that would not be wise," he said.     he said that the extension of the short-term lines would not be carried out through "an official instrument" as there was not time to complete the legal requirements.     gros said brazil was likely to meet again with the 14-bank advisory committee once brazil had information to present on an economic plan.  reuter &#3;</h3>
