	<h3>china will set quotas later this month to cut the amount of farmland converted to non-agricultural uses, the china daily said.     the quotas will restrict the conversion of farmland to farmers' housing or construction by state departments and collective institutions and enterprises.     the newspaper quoted wang xianjin, general director of the state land administration, as saying the 1987 quota would be below the 320,000 hectares lost in 1985. land loss and population growth have cut cultivated land per person to one-tenth of a hectare, half the amount of the early 1950s.  reuter &#3;</h3>
