	<h3>the commodity futures trading commission, cftc, is expected to accept the chicago board of trade's, cbt, proposal to establish a night trading session when the commission meets wednesday, cftc officials said.     cbt has proposed starting an evening trading session between 1800 and 2100 local time in treasury bond and treasury note futures and options on the two futures contracts.     the exchange hopes to launch the experiment april 30.     while cftc staff have raised numerous questions about how the evening session will operate, they have not discovered any major obstacle to approval, cftc sources said.     "we are not anticipating any problems with approval," a cbt official said.     cbt president thomas donovan and cbt chairman karsten mahlmann have been in the far east this month to drum up support for the night session.  reuter &#3;</h3>
