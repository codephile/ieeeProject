	<h3>solar systems by sundance inc said it agreed to buy a 45 pct interest in a company that will sell condoms produced by inkey sa of spain.     it said a spermicide used in inkey's condoms contains an ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of aids. the ingredient was cited in an article in the west german publication, aids forschung. but it said the article was about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the condoms made by inkey.     the company also said it is changing its name to eurocapital corp shortly.     solar systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a u.s.-based <europharmaceutical co>. inkey and an affiliate own the remaining shares of the company, which was set up to distribute condoms and vaginal products that are made, or are being developed by inkey.     the agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to inkey for the distributorship. the first 500,000 dlr payment is due 30 days after the products are approved by the food and drug administration. it said europharmaceutical plans to soon file with the fda to market the condom, but expects the approval process to be a lengthy one.     the company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is currently used in the u.s. in antiseptic applications unrelated to condoms. as far as it knows, the ingredient has not been tested in a spermicide.     inkey's condoms will be sold in the u.s. under the brand name, "carlton." the exclusive distribution contract for the products runs for three years and is renewable for one-year periods, the company said.     it said the condoms are currently sold in spain but have not gone on sale in other european countries.     it said europharmaceutical currently does not have the resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from the fda.     the company also said europharmaceutical is in talks to acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little or no assets. in the event an acquisition goes through, solar systems' interest in europharmaceutical would be diluted below its current 45 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
