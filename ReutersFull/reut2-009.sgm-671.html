	<h3>france's right-wing government now expects to raise about 40 billion francs this year from its privatisation program, 10 billion more than it targetted, prime minister jacques chirac said.     the success of the program, launched late last year, meant the government would be able to go beyond the 30 billion franc figure it estimated in its 1987 budget, he said in a television interview.     about 75 pct of the additional revenue would be used to cut state debt and 25 pct to provide additional funds for public sector investment, he said.     chirac said finance minister edouard balladur proposed to make two billion francs of supplementary funding available for a five biillion franc accelerated motorway building program.     the remaining three billion francs for this would come from a motorway loan now in the domestic market.     balladur also proposed to make some extra cash available to the french national railways, sncf, for the construction of high-speed rail track, and to boost research in the aerospace industry, he added.     an estimated 15,000 jobs would be generated by speeding up motorway construction, chirac said.     reaffirming his long term strategy of cutting the state sector deficit and easing taxes, chirac repeated government pledges to cut the corporate tax rate to 42 pct from 45 pct in the 1988 budget.     personal income tax would also be reduced but details had still to be worked out, he added.     the government aimed to make france the leading economic power in western europe within five years, he told his television interviewer.  reuter &#3;</h3>
