	<h3>exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, reuters holdings plc <rtrs.l> chairman sir christopher hogg said.     in the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the tokyo and london stock exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through reuter services.     "many other markets maintain restrictions," he added.     hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests.     in other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses.     he also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors.     "reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. as a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage," he added.     reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg.     earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p. the annual shareholder meeting will be held in london on april 29.  reuter &#3;</h3>
