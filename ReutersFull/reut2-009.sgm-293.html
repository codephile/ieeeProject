	<h3>the cost of living in north rhine-westphalia, germany's most populous state, fell 0.1 pct in the month to mid-march to stand 0.5 pct lower than at the same time a year earlier, the regional statistics office said.     prices had risen 0.3 pct in the month to mid-february but had fallen 0.7 pct year-on-year.     the regional figures are considered a good guide to national inflation trends. the federal statistics office is due to publish provisional national figures for march by the end of this month.  reuter &#3;</h3>
