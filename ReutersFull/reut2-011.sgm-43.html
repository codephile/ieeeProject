	<h3>transamerican natural gas corp, which has been operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since january 1983, said it filed an amended and restated negotiated plan of reorganization.     a hearing on the adequacy of the disclosure statement is scheduled for april 29 in the u.s. bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas.     basic terms of the amended and restated negotiated plan have not changed from the original plan filed last october, the company said.      the amended filing reflects adding ancillary documents to the plan filed in october, it said.     assuming the plan is found adequate on april 29, transamerican would then seek acceptance from creditors which is relatively assured since they participated in the negotiations, the company said.     liabilities in excess of one billion dlrs are being reorganized under the amended plan which provides for full debt-repayment to secured bank lenders.     unsecured creditors would receive either 100 pct repayment, secured by liens on assets, or one-time lump sum payments of 25 to 35 cts on the dollar, in cash, shortly after confirmation of the plan by the court.     transamerican is vigorously resisting efforts by coastal corp <cgp> to acquire its assets through a subsequent plan of liquidation.     the spokesman said the company is confident its plan will be confirmed and is optimistic that it will emerge from chapter 11 as early ninety days after the april 29 confirmation.     a coastal spokesman said it will file a plan in april with the court and will request the court to review its plan.     on march 17, the company said that as a creditor, which is owed 625,000 dlrs, it has a right to file its own plan which will better serve the other creditors in a shorter time.     a transamerican spokesman said the net worth of coastal's offer is less than 25 pct of the fair market value of transamerican's assets which are in excess of one billion dlrs.        reuter &#3;</h3>
