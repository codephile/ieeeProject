	<h3>at least 14 people were injured and many arrested in clashes during a one-day general strike called by ecuadorean workers to protest against austerity measures imposed after a major earthquake on march 5.     interior minister luis robles said the worst violence was in quito, where demonstrators threw rocks at a luxury hotel and a number of banks.     over 80 people in eight cities were detained for stoning police, attacking troops, damaging buildings and setting fire to cars, he said. the casualty and damage toll is expected to rise as detailed reports reach the capital from the provinces.     labour leaders said they shut down all of ecuador's industrial plants, but labour minister jorge egas said of the country's 900 largest factories only 86 were closed, 32 were partially working and the rest operating normally.     the strike, called by leftist unions and declared illegal by the government, was aimed at pressing the administration to scrap an austerity program adopted on march 13 following an earthquake that killed up to 1,000 people and caused an estimated billion dlrs in damage.  reuter &#3;</h3>
