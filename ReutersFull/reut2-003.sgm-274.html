	<h3>pitt-des moines inc said it will receive a qualified opinion from auditors on its 1986 and 1985 financial statements.     it said the qualification related to its inability to determine the effects, if any, of the final resolution of a suit filed against it by <washington public power supply system>.  the 1985 suit was dismissed in a 1986 lower court action, but the ultimate outcome of the matter is still uncertain since washington public power has appealed to the u.s. court of appeals.  reuter &#3;</h3>
