	<h3>international banks have radically changed their attitudes towards debt and lending and debtor nations will have to explore new methods of ensuring inflows, philippine central bank governor jose fernandez said.     "commercial banks have tended to be rather difficult in terms of new money for some time now," he told reporters at a news conference. "within the world there are enormous changes taking place in attitudes of different banks."     he said the banks were no longer flush with funds from the post-1973 oil boom and were reluctant to lend money.     "they don't have the same kind of money they used to have ... they find their whole deposit base eroding," fernandez said. groups of major banks had decided that the international arena was not to their liking.     "they wind up with 7/8 (over eurodollar rates) and who wants 7/8 really? it's nothing. they want to get the frills, but if they are not big enough they don't get the frills."     the philippines on wednesday announced it wanted to renegotiate a debt restructuring accord it reached on march 27 with its 12-bank advisory committee, saying it wanted the same terms as were granted to argentina earlier this week.     argentina was granted a 19-year repayment at 13/16 points over eurodollar rates, the same historically low spread that mexico won last october, while the philippines, which had insisted on a deal similar to mexico's, restructured 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28.2 billion dlr foreign debt at 7/8.     fernandez said the old type of new-money agreement, where hundreds of banks were forced into involuntary lending by an advisory committee that negotiated agreements with debtor countries, was becoming increasingly difficult.     he said involuntary lending proved useful in the two or three years since the mexican debt crisis in 1982.     "but the present tendency has been that more and more of the banks, specially the regionals or the small ones, have either sold off their portfolios or simply by policy will not put up any more money," fernandez said.     he said another disturbing development was the so-called national quota approach adopted by groups of banks.     "groups of banks by nationality have chosen to take a look at what other groups of banks in other countries are willing to do and if let us say british banks wind up giving 99 pct of what is needed and u.s. banks give only 92 pct, then the british banks say as a whole they will pull out," he said.     "there are banks that have decided that lending is not a good business any more. they want to deal in securities, they want to go into investment banking, they want to go into the turnover business rather than the carry business," fernandez said. "we have to thread our way through a constellation of banks, all of whom have different objectives."     he said in order to survive, the philippines would have to try and stimulate new types of inflows, "whether this be direct investments, whether this be investments by institutions that now have chosen not to lend but to invest, or whether this be debt to equity conversions."  reuter &#3;</h3>
