	<h3>proposals for a secondary market for the resale of farm real estate loans similar to home mortgage markets is gaining support in congress and among rural lenders and could be established this year, congressional and financial sources said.     several bills which would establish a farm secondary market have been introduced in both the house and senate. furthermore, representatives of the farm credit system, commercial bankers and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree on a method of establishing the market.     frank naylor, chairman of the farm credit administration (fca), which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture "as long as the farm credit system is a key player."     naylor told a house agriculture subcommittee hearing the secondary market could be established either with congressional legislation or administratively.     any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the successful resale markets in home mortgages, the government national mortgage association (gnma) and the federal home loan mortgage corporation (freddie mac), industry sources said.     commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main supporters of a farm loan secondary market because they believe it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system, traditionally the largest lender to farmers.     a farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell high-quality loans on farmland to "poolers" who in turn would package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for resale to investors-- called aggie-mae by some supporters.     however, the fca and financially-troubled farm credit system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea.     the ambivalence is because any farm secondary market established in the private sector that excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage. that could be a financial blow to the system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years, naylor and farm credit system officials have said.     a study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the secondary market idea, the american council of life insurers, concludes the farm credit system's market share in rural lending would fall if a secondary market were established. the study was released earlier today.  reuter &#3;</h3>
