	<h3>the hong kong stock exchange said it will not accept further proposals by listed firms to issue new shares with reduced par value but equal voting rights.     it said in a statement the exchange will review the previously announced proposals of bonus issues of "b" shares by jardine matheson holdings ltd <jard.hk>, cheung kong (holdings) ltd <ckgh.hk> and hutchison whampoa ltd <hwhh.hk>.     it added the exchange's listing committee will meet later today to consider these proposals.     the exchange statement said: "any such proposals (other than the three) will not be considered until a general principle has been established by the stock exchange after consultation with the securities commission."     an official of the securities commissioner's office told reuters the decision to bar the new share issues was made by the exchange, adding the commissioner is closely watching developments.     the hong kong market fell sharply yesterday and today as both cheung kong and hutchison announced a one-for-two bonus issue of "b" shares.     the cheung kong companies' move followed friday's announcement by jardine matheson of a four-for-one bonus issue of similar "b" shares with a reduced par value and equal voting rights.     brokers also noted market speculation that <evergo industrial enterprise ltd> will make a similar move after the firm requested to suspend share trading this morning. evergo officials were not immediately available for comment.     analysts said controlling shareholders might use the "b" shares to retain corporate control while selling some of their existing holdings to finance new investments.  reuter &#3;</h3>
