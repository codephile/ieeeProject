	<h3>sharp cutbacks in drilling in oklahoma and kansas pushed the u.s. drilling rig count down by 36 to a total of 748, against 1,034 working rigs one year ago, hughes tool co said.     the latest weekly count of rig activity reversed last week's gain of 23 rigs for a total of 784, which had been the first improvement in the drilling rig count this year.     "i have no explanation for the decline," said hughes economist ike kerridge. "i think we're near the bottom of this year's rig count but the wet ground in northern and midcontinent states could affect the count in the next few weeks."     among individual states, oklahoma and kansas reported declines of 16 and 11 working rigs last week. texas lost seven and michigan and wyoming were each down by three rigs. gains were reported in louisiana and california, which increased by seven and six, respectively.     in canada, the rig count dropped by 52 to a total of 131 working rigs, against 222 one year ago. kerridge attributed the steep drop to the government's annual springtime ban against rigs and other heavy equipment being transported over rain-softened highways.  reuter &#3;</h3>
