	<h3>spain's second largest union, the workers commissions, cc.oo, has voted against a general strike next month to back wage demands and oppose the government's economic policies, a cc.oo spokesman said.     the proposal for a general strike was narrowly defeated at a meeting yesterday but union leaders voted instead for a national week of strike action beginning on april 3 and urged their members to concentrate their protests on april 10.     the socialist general workers' union, ugt, the country's biggest union, is against a general strike but has joined forces with cc.oo. to demand real wage rises this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
