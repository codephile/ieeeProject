	<h3>toshiba corp <tsba.t>, the japanese electronics group which plans to enter britain's liberalised telecommunications equipment market, risks becoming the first casualty in the current war of words over trade between japan and the u.k., government and industry sources said.     u.k. authorities have lost patience with japanese trading practices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate without unleashing a damaging trade war. "toshiba's timing seems most unfortunate for the company, as it comes exactly when we are looking for someone to punch," one official told reuters.     earlier, <toshiba information systems (u.k.) ltd> said it wanted to enter the british business facsimile and key telephone market. a facsimile machine sends printed data over telephone lines, while a key telephone system is used for switching calls within a business, industry sources said.     the move by toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute over japan's refusal to open up its telecommunications market to foreign companies. "toshiba's timing is most extraordinary," one official at the department of trade and industry (dti) said.     tommorrow, the u.k. government will consider what legal action it can possible take to press for japanese reform.     prime minister margaret thatcher has given notice that the u.k. would fight the japanese government's attempt to prevent cable and wireless plc <cawl.l> from taking a significant position in a new japanese international telecommunications venture. "we regard this as a test case," she told parliament.     but while the u.k. is keen to see some movement on the issue by japan, it is also worried that recent anti-japanese rhetoric may cause developments to get out of hand, officials said.     japanese officials in tokyo today reiterated that japan had no plans to bow to u.k. and u.s. pressure to give foreign telecommunications firms a bigger role there. reuter^m &#3;</h3>
