	<h3>alliant computer systems corp <alnt.o> said it introduced a parallel vector minisupercomputer priced at less than 100,000 dlrs.     the company said the new fx/4 makes multi-user supercomputing affordable for the first time to workgroups in industrial and commercial markets.     the company said it also introduced high-performance compiler and algorithm products for the fx/series systems.         alliant said it achieved the low price for the fx/4 through a combination of new packaging technology and cost decreases due to semiconductor price improvements and manufacturing efficiencies.     the company also released the fx/c compiler, which it said can double the performance of c programs.     the company said its newly released algorithm products, the fx/linpack and fx/eispack libraries, are collections of mathematical subroutines that programmers can call from all alliant languages.  reuter &#3;</h3>
