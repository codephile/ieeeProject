	<h3>mitchell energy and development corp said it plans to hold its capital spending in fiscal 1988, ending january 31, to 96 mln dlrs, down from the 123 mln dlrs spent in 1987 and 213 mln dlrs in 1986.     the company also said its natural gas revenues so far this year have been reduced by lower contract customer purchases due to mild weather and soft economic conditions.     "but the contracts call for the lower 'takes' to be made up during the course of the year," mitchell energy said. meanwhile it will sell additional quantities of gas on the spot market.     mitchell energy said the additional spot sales will tend to lower the average price realized for gas in the early part of fiscal 1988.     however, it said the average for the full year is not expected to be significantly lower than the 2.99 dlrs per thousand cubic feet averaged in fiscal 1987.                         reuter &#3;</h3>
