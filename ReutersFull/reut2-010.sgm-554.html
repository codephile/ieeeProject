	<h3>westinghouse electric corp <wx> said it is still open to a merger of its radio operations with general electrics co's <ge> nbc radio operations.     "we have left the door open and ge is reassessing the merger and so are we," westinghouse chairman douglas danforth told reuters at the conclusion of a meeting before analysts.     danforth said he continues to see value in a merger between westinghouse's radio operation and those of nbc.      discussions with nbc on the merger of the two companies' radio units were suspended in december.     danforth reaffirmed that westinghouse is interested in acquisitions, saying the company is leaning toward acquisitions in the 300 mln to 500 mln dlr range. he said, however, that larger acquisitions are possible if they are the right fit.     danforth, who earlier today said he expects earnings growth in the double-digit range through 1989, said he is comfortable with analysts' predictions of 4.80 dlrs to 5.30 dlrs a share this year. in 1986 the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share.     he said the company has targeted waste energy systems and hazardous waste removal, as some of the emerging growth areas for the company.  reuter &#3;</h3>
