	<h3>nuclear data inc said its bank lenders agreed to extend its secured loan agreement through june 30, 1987.     the agreement, which covers about 9.5 mln dlrs in short term debt, had been scheduled to expire february 28.     terms of the extension require nuclear data to obtain replacement financing from outside sources before june 30, it said.     if the company is unable to or fails to achieve certain projected operating results in the meantime, it will be required to divest enough assets to retire its debt, it said.     for the first nine months of its fiscal 1987 year ended november 30, 1986, nuclear data reported a loss of almost nine mln dlrs or 4.98 dlrs a share on revenues of 32.6 mln dlrs.     nuclear data cited improvement in printed circuit board sales and said it is confident it will obtain replacement financing.     in other action, nuclear data said it set up a 1.25 mln dlrs reserve to cover the revaluation of certain domestic medical inventory and the redirection of its u.s. medical sales efforts.     the reserve was taken to offset a decline in the u.s. dollar against the danish kroner and other factors adversely affecting sales of its danish manufactured medical products in the u.s. market, nuclear data said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
