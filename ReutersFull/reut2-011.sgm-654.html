	<h3>the commodity credit corporation (ccc) has switched 10 mln dlrs in credit guarantees to mexico to cover purchases of u.s. wheat, the u.s. agriculture department said.     the credit guarantees were previously earmarked for sales of u.s. dry edible beans and rice, it said.     the action reduces the guarantee lines previously authorized of dry edible beans to by five mln dlrs to 45 mln dlrs and for rice from five mln to zero and increases coverage for wheat sales from five mln to 15 mln dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
