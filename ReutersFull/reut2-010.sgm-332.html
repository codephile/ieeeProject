	<h3>syndication for elders ixl ltd's <elxa.s> 100 mln australian dlr note issuance facility has been completed, arranger westpac finance asia ltd said.     it said the facility, which is half underwritten and half non-underwritten, has been over-subscribed and underwriters' allocations are reduced from the original commitments.     the managers of the facility are westpac, bank of montreal asia ltd, bot international (hk) ltd, commonwealth bank of australia and credit industriel et commercial de paris. they will be underwriting six mln dlrs each instead of 10 mln dlrs.     co-managers are banque bruxelles lambert, ka wah bank, kyowa bank, saitama bank, sanwa bank and yasuda trust and banking co ltd. they will be underwriting three mln dlrs each instead of five mln dlrs. bt asia ltd is junior co-manager with a two mln dlr commitment.     westpac launched the facility early this month at 200 mln dlrs but soon reduced it to 100 mln dlrs and amended the terms due to the market's cool response. the underwriting margin was raised to 10 basis points over the australian dlr bank bill rate. originally the margin was set at 6.25 basis points for up to 50 mln dlrs and at 2.5 basis points for the remainder.  reuter &#3;</h3>
