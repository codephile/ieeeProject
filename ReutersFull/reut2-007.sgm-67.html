	<h3>waste management inc said it sent a letter to the chemlawn corp board, saying it is prepared to increase its bid for chemlawn to 33 dlrs a share, from 27 dlrs, if chemlawn promptly negotiates and executes a simple two-step merger agreement containing only essential covenants and conditions.     upon such an agreement, waste management said, it would amend its 27 dlrs a share cash tender offer.  reuter &#3;</h3>
