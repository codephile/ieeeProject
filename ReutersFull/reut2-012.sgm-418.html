	<h3>the danish banks association announced a plan to help depositors in the small sixth of july bank (6. juli banken a/s), which ceased payments on march 23 after the government bank inspectorate said provisions were too low.     the association said in a statement that its 80 members would give full cover for private deposits up to 50,000 danish crowns, with 80 pct cover for deposits between 50,000 and 100,000 crowns and for special pension savings accounts up to 500,000 crowns.     non-pension deposits over 100,000 crowns and business customers are not covered by the plan, the statement added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
