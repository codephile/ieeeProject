	<h3>swiss banks are holding talks with protestant and roman catholic officials to hear church complaints about lending to south africa, the swiss bankers' association said.     in a statement the association said the parties had disagreed over economic sanctions.     but all participants -- representatives of the three biggest swiss banks, the bankers' association itself, the churches and church charities -- agreed to condemn south africa's apartheid policy both publicly and in contacts with business and government offices there.     after two private sessions last august and on march 10, they agreed the meetings should continue.     swiss banks are criticised by the churches who say they are in effect lending support to the south african government.     the banks assured the churchmen that their lending had declined substantially last year and that they had no intention of building it up as banks from other countries withdrew.     pius haffner of the catholic charity justitia et pax told reuters, "it is at least a small step forward when the banks say publicly they will not jump in when other banks pull out."  reuter &#3;</h3>
