	<h3>the federal deposit insurance corp. proposed for comment a rule setting minimum capital requirements for banks based on assessment of the risks of their assets.     the proposed rule, if adopted, would carry out a u.s.-british agreement announced in january for a uniform system to gauge the capital banks must maintain that accounts for the riskiness of loans and other assets.     the regulatory agency's staff said at a meeting the proposal was in line with those of the federal reserve board and the comptroller of the currency.     the three u.s. agencies and the bank of england agreed in early january on the outlines of a uniform system for capital standards designed for the increasingly international banking industry that operates beyond national boundaries.     the fdic, which regulates state-chartered banks, sought public comment for 60 days, after which it will adopt a rule to conform with those of the fed and the comptroller.     the fdic said the proposal rule redefines primary capital, assigns risk weights to assets not kept on a bank's balance sheet, and lays the groundwork for establishing a minimum risk-based capital ratio.  reuter &#3;</h3>
