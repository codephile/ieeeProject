	<h3>suzuki motor co ltd <szmt.t> is negotiating a joint venture with hungary to assemble compact cars there following a request from its government, the first entry by a japanese car maker into a communist country, a suzuki spokesman said.     the company, in which general motors corp <gm.n> has a 4.9 pct stake, has to set up such projects to avoid cutting component production in japan. existing overseas vehicle projects are increasing local content and so using fewer japanese parts, the spokesman said.     its indian joint venture <maruti udyog ltd>, mul, 26 pct owned by suzuki, will reduce component imports from japan as it increases local content to 60 pct from the present 40 pct in 1987, the spokesman said.     the yen's continued rise against the dollar and japan's self-imposed restrictions on exports to the u.s. and europe were also to blame for cuts in car component manufacture in japan, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
