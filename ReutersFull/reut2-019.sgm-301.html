	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it downgraded to b-plus from a about 50 mln dlrs of collateral trust notes of leaseway transportation corp.     s and p cited a leveraged buyout offer from an investor group that was organized by citibank and included management.     the buyout of leaseway will result in significant deterioration of its balance sheet, the agency pointed out.     leaseway's strong competitive position in auto hauling and retail support services will enable it to generate sufficient cash flow to service commitments. but s and p expects debt leverage to remain extremely high for the forseeable future.  reuter &#3;</h3>
