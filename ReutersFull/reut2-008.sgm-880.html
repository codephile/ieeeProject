	<h3>nigeria and britain signed an agreement to reschedule nigeria's official debts in the first of an expected series of such talks, government sources said.     the agreement was signed by nigerian finance minister chu okongwu and the export credits guarantee department's (ecgd) chief executive jack gill.     the nigerians will go on to paris for similar bilateral talks tomorrow with coface, the french export credit agency.     today's agreement follows an agreement between nigeria and the paris club of western creditor governments in december to reschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of official debt.     the paris club agreement was for a rescheduling of the 7.5 billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between september 1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace.     but as with all paris club pacts, specific interest rates and other details have to be negotiated on a bi-lateral basis with the countries involved. none of the details contained in today's negotiations was immediately available.     the nigerians are hoping that further bilateral accords can be struck fairly soon as this could encourage official export credit agencies to renew insurance cover for exports to nigeria.     the ecgd suspended its cover for exports to nigeria in 1983. despite the success of the talks over the past two days, govenment sources said there had not been any discussions on new credits.     nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export credits this year from official agencies under a structrual adjustment program drawn up by nigeria and the world bank to support a rescheduling of part of the country's 19 billion dlr foreign debt.     but these credits cannot be approved until the export credit agencies agree to resume insuring the debts.  reuter &#3;</h3>
