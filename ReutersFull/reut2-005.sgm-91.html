	<h3>varity corp, formerly massey-ferguson ltd, said it expected to report on march 25 a loss for the fourth quarter and full-year ended january 31.     a company spokesman said specific figures were unavailable.     varity posted a net profit of 3.9 mln u.s. dlrs for the previous fiscal year ended january 31, 1986 and a 3.3 mln dlr net profit for the previous fourth quarter. its net loss for the nine months ended october 31 totaled 4.7 mln dlrs after a 19.7 mln dlr third quarter loss tied to strikes and plant shutdowns at its british and french operations.     varity also said it would seek shareholder approval at a special shareholders' meeting on april 9 to authorize a transfer of values to the contributed surplus account on its balance sheet from the stated capital account for common shares.     the spokesman said the move would help raise company values required to pay dividends under canadian law.  reuter &#3;</h3>
