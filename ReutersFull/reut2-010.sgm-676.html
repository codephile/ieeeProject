	<h3>the finance ministry is trying to eliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases of japanese treasury bills by foreign governments and central banks, in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets, a senior finance ministry official said.     the official declined to give details but securities sources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on t-bills to be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buy bills. the current practice of filing tax redemption claims is time consuming, they said.     securities houses here have had difficulty selling six-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseas governments and central banks because of the tax system and the bank of japan's book entry system, which demands the accounts be kept with the houses rather than by the bank.     tankoku, introduced in february 1986, were designed as a key short-term instrument to promote internationalization of the yen. but since the introduction of a complicated book-entry system for bill purchases in january 1986, foreign governments and central banks have shied away from buying the bills, the sources said.     foreign governments and central banks are therefore expected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the bank of japan, the securities sources said.     relevant measures are likely to be announced at the next u.s.-japan yen-dollar committee meeting on the deregulation of tokyo's financial market, expected in may, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
