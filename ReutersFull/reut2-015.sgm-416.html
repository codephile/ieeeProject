	<h3>credit commercial de france <ccfp.pa> reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its denationalisation around the end of this month.     official sources said the bank, france's sixth largest in terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.     previously one of france's biggest private banks, it was nationalised by the socialists in 1982.     the sources said it was too early to give details of the planned split or of the share price, but cited april 27 as a likely date for the flotation launch.     so far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to ten shareholders before the flotation.     the private tender offer closes on april 16, while a 12 mln franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on sunday. "the privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients," ccf deputy director-general rene de la serre told reuters.     market sources put the total value of ccf's privatisation at between four and five billion francs.     de la serre said the bank was likely to attract at least the same number of investors as <sogenal>, another recently privatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares.     the government's sweeping privatisation programme has also included the sale of saint-gobain <sgep.pa>, and cie financiere de paribas <pari.pa>. the sale of <banque du batiment et des travaux publics> and <banque industrielle et mobiliere privee> should be completed this month, while third largest french bank societe generale <sgen.pa> will be privatised later this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
