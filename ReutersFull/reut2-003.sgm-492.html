	<h3>a tight money market has pushed interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between 15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said.     march is usually a tight month for the money market because of tax payments and banks' need to attract funds for their year-end accounts on march 31.     this year the situation has been made worse by december's rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared imposition of exchange controls. much of that outflow has yet to be converted back into rupiah.     "a lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is holding out until after april," one u.s. banker said.     the tight money policy of bank indonesia, the central bank, is helping to keep rates high.     short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with no prospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said.     central bank governor arifin siregar said earlier this week that indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects in 1987/88, but added the "speculators" who led a run on the rupiah late last year could again pose problems.     indonesia holds general elections on april 23, the first in five years, and most businessmen expect no new government economic packages or incentives before then.     "some people are nervous about what the government will do after the election," one banker said. "they normally try to do things before the iggi (inter-governmental group on indonesia) meeting (in june) to prove they are doing something about the economy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars."     the iggi, which groups 14 industrialised donor countries and four agencies, gave indonesia 2.5 billion dlrs in soft loans and grants last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
