	<h3>treasury secretary james baker said the united states was not seeking loan veto in its negotiation for voting power at the inter-american development bank.     discussing the ongoing negotiation, baker said the u.s. position is that the countries that pay in the most should have the greatest say over the loan decisions.     the u.s. is seeking the power to block loan votes with one other country, and the issue will be discussed in miami later this month at the annual meeting of the latin development bank.  reuter &#3;</h3>
