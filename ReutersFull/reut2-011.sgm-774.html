	<h3>malaysia said it cut the gazetted price of rubber to 202-7/8 cents per kg from 213-1/2 cents in march, effective immediately.     no export duty is applicable at this level, against 3/8 cent per kg last month, because the government raised the export duty threshold price to 210 cents per kg in early 1985.     the cess for rubber research and replanting remained unchanged at 3.85 and 9.92 cents per kg respectively.  reuter &#3;</h3>
