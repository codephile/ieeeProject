	<h3>the u.s. agriculture department is seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the commodity credit corporation's (ccc) discount and premium schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan collateral or under price support programs.     the premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality factors such as moisture content and kernel damage. the schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing grain the ccc accepts or purchases during the year.     the department said it is possible that producers could be encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to ccc by adjusting the premiums and discounts.     comments are due by april 24 and a report to congress is required by law by may 10.  reuter &#3;</h3>
