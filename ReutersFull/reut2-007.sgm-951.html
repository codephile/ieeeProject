	<h3>the european community (ec) agreed on new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast stretches of the region's forests.     diplomats said ec environment ministers meeting here agreed member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.     the reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with tougher standards imposed for new models from april 1988 and for all new vehicles from october 1990.     the ec's executive commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation community if all heavy vehicles met the new standards.     there are an estimated nine mln trucks and buses in use in the ec, according to commission figures.     the ministers also gave west germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars, diplomats said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
