	<h3>cash grain dealers reported slow country movement of corn and soybeans across the midwest, with even corn sales from pik-and-roll activity seen earlier this week drying up.     some dealers said the usda may further adjust the posted county price at the gulf to take into account high barge freight rates as a way to keep corn sales flowing, but added the current plan probably will be given a few weeks to see if it will work as hoped.     corn and soybean basis values continued to drop on the illinois and midmississippi river due to the strong barge freight rates. toledo and chicago elevators were finishing loading the first corn boats of the new shipping season, supporting spot basis values at those terminal points.   reuter &#3;</h3>
