	<h3>sri lanka and the international monetary fund (imf) have reached agreement on the broad outline of economic reforms, but tough negotiations are likely before the imf approves up to 240 mln dlrs in loans, a senior finance ministry official told reuters.     he said the government and imf this week agreed on a package to reduce the balance of payments deficit, improve management of public enterprises, reform tariffs, develop non-traditional exports and privatise public firms.     an imf-world bank team will visit colombo next month to start negotiations on details of a three-year economic reform programme. "there is a broad agreement on the content of the policy package for a structural reform," the official said. "but in areas where the reform would take place, there would be tough neotiations on how much you do and in what order should it take place," he added.     sri lanka is seeking a total of about 240 mln dlrs in structural adjustment loans to support the balance of payments and in a compensatory financing facility to offset losses in commodity exports.     sri lanka needs the imf and world bank approval of the two facilities to clear the way for negotiations on requests for aid and loans from donor countries.     these include an expected pledge of 550 mln dlrs from from 12 industrialised countries and about 240 mln dlrs in loans from the world bank and the asian development bank.     finance minister ronnie de mel said in an interview published today by the daily news that there was likelihood of sri lanka obtaining all of that aid despite intense lobbying by pro-tamil and human rights groups abroad.     he said that although friendly countries were still prepared to assist sri lanka with concessional aid, colombo would have to surmount many problems in detailed negotiations due in may, june and august before these loans are finalised.     "in these matters, there's many a slip between the cup and the lip as other governments have learned to their cost," de mel said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
