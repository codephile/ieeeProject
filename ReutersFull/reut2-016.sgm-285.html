	<h3>giant bay resources ltd said it signed an agreement in principle with hecla mining co for an operating joint venture on hecla's stibnite, idaho, gold deposit.     giant bay said if its bioleaching technology is used for ore processing, it will have the right to acquire a working interest in the property. it said it may spend as much as three mln u.s. dlrs, excluding capital costs to bring the mine into production. it said drilling has indicated substantial sulphide reserves with a gold grade of about 0.1 ounce a ton, and early tests show the gold ore responds to bioleaching.   reuter &#3;</h3>
