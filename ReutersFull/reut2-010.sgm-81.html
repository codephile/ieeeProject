	<h3>the u.s. general accounting office said generic commodities certificates cost the u.s. government in total commodity credit corp outlays 107 mln to 653 mln dlrs more than cash payments through february, 1987.     however, gao senior associate director brian crowley, in testimony prepared for delivery to the senate agriculture committee, said short-term commodity storage cost savings related to the use of payment-in-kind certificates could be from about 169 mln 253 mln dlrs.     u.s. agriculture undersecretary daniel amstutz said the issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates in fiscal years 1986-88 could cost as much as 550 mln dlrs more than cash outlays.     in his prepared remarks to the senate panel, amstutz stressed that usda was "very pleased with the success of using commodity certificates" and looked forward to their continued use.     he said the cost of using certificates must be weighed against immediate benefits, including greater market liquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farm income, improved debt situation and decreased carrying charges, especially pertaining to 1985 crop loans.     crowley said future government storage costs would be reduced only if in the long run certificates led to a decrease in ccc-owned inventory.     "we believe that such a reduction, if it occurs, will not be large," crowley said.     crowley also said that because certificate amounts are not included in the federal budget's outlay totals at the time of issuance, they could "lessen the usefulness of the budget."     crowley conceded that certificates help farmers avoid storage costs, give them marketing flexibility and enhance farmers' incomes.     he also said certificates have benefited the grain industry by giving it easier access to ccc-owned grain at market prices.  reuter &#3;</h3>
