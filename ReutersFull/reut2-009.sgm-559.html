	<h3><snc group inc> expects 1987 earnings to rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last year, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last year's 350 mln dlrs, president alex taylor said before the annual meeting.     snc, canada's second biggest engineering and construction group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of canadian arsenals ltd from the canadian government.     the impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt fully in 1987, taylor said.     defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will account for more than half snc's total 1987 revenues, helping to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and construction acivities, taylor said.     last year, snc earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small extraordinary gain.     in 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.  reuter &#3;</h3>
