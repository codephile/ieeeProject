	<h3>the united states today handed soviet arms negotiators a draft treaty which would eliminate all superpower medium-range nuclear missiles in europe and slash such weapons elsewhere to 100 warheads on each side.     maynard glitman, who heads the american team discussing medium-range nuclear forces, told reporters the document, "a full treaty text," was now on the negotiating table.     the proposal responds to a new soviet offer to abolish "euromissiles" and cut sharply medium-range nuclear forces elsewhere announced by mikhail gorbachev last saturday.     the developments have been described by many disarmament experts as the first real opening for a superpower accord since they resumed arms control talks in march 1985.     glitman presented the draft treaty during a one and a half hour meeting at the american diplomatic mission with the soviet team on medium-range missiles headed by lem masterkov.     he told reporters: "it is a complete document. it has to be because we want precision. we don't want any ambiguities."     the draft called for elimination - removal and destruction - of all superpower medium-range missiles in europe over five years and reduction elsewhere during that period to 100 atomic warheads on each side, glitman added.     in europe, this includes 270 soviet triple-warhead ss-20's and 316 single-warhead u.s. pershing-2 and cruise missiles.  reuter &#3;</h3>
