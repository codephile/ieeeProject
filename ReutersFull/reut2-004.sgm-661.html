	<h3>indonesian energy minister subroto said he sees the oil market continuing bullish, with underlying demand expected to rise later in the year.     he told a press conference in jakarta at the end of a two-day meeting of south-east asian energy ministers that he saw prices stabilizing around 18 dlrs a barrel.     "the sentiment in the market is bullish and i think it will continue that way as demand will go up in the third or fourth quarters," subroto said.     asked about the prospect for oil prices, he said: "i think they will stabilise around 18 dlrs, although there is a little turbulence ..."     "of course the spot price will fluctuate, but the official price will remain at 18 dlrs," he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
