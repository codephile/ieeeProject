	<h3>ashland oil inc said it expects to report a loss from operations in the second quarter.     the company also said it expects to report a 10 mln dlrs net gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to pay down debt. "however, it is difficult to determine now whether this gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating loss," the company said in a statement. a company spokesman would not elaborate.     the company's ashland petroleum co unit operated at a loss in january and february since it was unable to raise product prices enough to recover higher crude oil costs, ashland said.     although ashland petroleum and superamerica, a retail marketing operation, are having a difficult quarter, the company's valvoline, ashland chemical and coal businesses are expected to report good results for the quarter ended march 31.     in the year-ago quarter, ashland had income from operations of 93.8 mln dlrs before corporate and interest expenses, taxes, equity income and other items.     net income in the quarter was 39.4 mln dlrs or 1.12 dlrs a share on sales of 1.78 billion dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
