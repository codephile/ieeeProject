	<h3>the bank of spain suspended its daily money market assistance obliging borrowers to take funds from the second window, where on wednesday rates were raised to 16 pct compared with 14 pct for normal overnight funds.     money market sources said in view of high borrower demand the suspension was likely to remain in effect until april 3, the start of the next 10-day accounting period for reserve requirements. the suspension comes after the bank yesterday gave 1,145 billion pesetas assistance, a record high for this year.     it said 90 billion pesetas was provided at the second window.  reuter &#3;</h3>
