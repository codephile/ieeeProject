	<h3>fiat spa <fiat.mi> declined to confirm or deny an italian newspaper report that it was studying the possibility of issuing a convertible bond.     the milan daily, il giornale, said a convertible bond issue was under study but gave no details.     a fiat spokesman contacted by reuters said only that the report was "one of the typical rumours which circulate on the bourse."     senior sources at the milan investment bank sige, which il giornale said was involved in the planning along with mediobanca - banca di credito finanziario spa and imi - istituto mobiliare italiano, said they were unaware of any such project.  reuter &#3;</h3>
