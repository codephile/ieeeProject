	<h3>the world bank said it has extended pakistan 220 mln dlrs in three loans to support projects in education, energy conservation and modernization, and small-scale industry development.     the education project will be supported by a 145 mln dlr loan through the international development association, the bank's concessionary lending affiliate, the bank said.     the bank noted pakistan's low educational attainment, particularly among women, is an obstacle to the country's development.     it said the education project aims to increase literacy and school enrollment rates through curriculum reform, teacher training, parental participation and school construction.     a small-scale industry development project will be supported by a 54 mln dlr loan, the bank said.     the project hopes to aid small-scale industry by encouraging bank lending, developing export markets, and supporting technology transfer, the bank said.     the third project, to improve refinery efficiency, reduce energy consumption and increase crude oil processing capacity, will be supported by a 21 mln dlr loan.      reuter &#3;</h3>
