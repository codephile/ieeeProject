	<h3>american telephone and telegraph co said it has developed superconducting wires that can easily be formed into coils.     it said when cooled to 91 degrees kelvin, or 296 degrees below zero fahrenheit, the wires conduct electricity without resistance.     att said the wires are made of a barium-yttrium-copper oxide compound.  it said while many engineering details remain to be worked out, "the ability to draw the material into fine wire and to wind the wire into coils and other forms is key for many superconductor applications now being considered."  reuter &#3;</h3>
