	<h3>finance minister mohammed ali abal-khail said a committee will be set up to examine the problem of late government payments to contractors and companies operating in the kingdom.     he told a working session on the first day of a businessmen's conference yesterday that the committee, made up of finance ministry and chamber of commerce officials, will be formed shortly.     he said the committee will also investigate disputes between contractors and the government, but said the foreign press had to some extent exaggerated payments problems.     abal-khail said, "it is only natural that among those thousands of contracts some problems perpetrated by disputes over specifications, contractual obligations, project-handovers and duration of contracts arose."     late payments, or in some cases total absence of payments, have been a major source of concern for both the saudi private sector and foreign contractors operating in the kingdom.     businessmen said the minister's remarks were a rare admission of problems in the contract sector and the first concrete sign of government action to tackle payments delays.  reuter &#3;</h3>
