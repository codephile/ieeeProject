	<h3>the federal reserve board unanimously approved a proposal to allow federal reserve banks to offer a redeposit service for bounced checks.     the service would allow a commercial bank that sends checks to a reserve bank for collection to instruct the reserve bank to redeposit a bounced check rather than return it.     the reserve banks would be required to charge a fee for the redeposit service that would cover its costs.     the plan would leave it to each reserve bank to set a dollar cutoff for eligible returns.     the fed acted after industry studies showed that nearly two-thirds of bounced checks cleared the second time around.     the fed said studies show that fewer than one pct of the more than 40 billion checks written each year in the united states are returned unpaid.     of those returned, about half are written for less than 100 dlrs.     the fed said many commercial banks already routinely redeposit low-dlr-value checks returned to them for insufficient funds.  reuter &#3;</h3>
