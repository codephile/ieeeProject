	<h3>growth in japan's m-2 plus certificates of deposit (cd) money supply in the october to december period is not expected to accelerate, but will remain at high levels between 11 and 12 pct, a senior bank of japan official said.     the central bank will keep a watch on high growth in liquidity because this is a factor that may cause rises in prices of goods, he said.     the september growth of 11.1 pct year on year announced earlier today should not be taken as implying that the money supply has started to expand very rapidly, he said. in august the rate of increase was 11.0 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
