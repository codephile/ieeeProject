	<h3><gull air inc> said it filed an anti-trust suit against texas air corp, charging the airline broke a marketing agreement and undertook predatory business practices aimed at shutting down gull air.     gull air, flying commerical routes in some 20 cities in the northeast, florida and the bahamas, said it reached a feeder agreement with texas air corp in march 1986.     under the five year marketing pact, gull said it coordinated its flights with texas air, continental, eastern and new york air, to facilitate connections and increase its business.     but when texas air acquired people express inc and its units, including bar harbor air line and provincetown-boston airline, the privately-held gull became a competitor to the texas air units, the company said.     the company said texas air then broke the five year agreement previously reached with gull, causing it to lose millions of dollars.     a company spokesman said gull has not yet set a monetary value on the amount on the damages it is seeking in the suit.  reuter &#3;</h3>
