	<h3>the world bank has suspended loans to peru because the country has over two months of payment arrears with the lending agency, central bank general manager hector neyra said.      he told reporters the government decided to stop paying the world bank because scheduled repayments outweighed the loans it was due to receive.      the measure was the latest hard-line debt stance adopted by the government of president alan garcia, one of latin america's most delinquent debtors. the 22-month-old administration has cut repayments to 10 pct of export earnings on nearly all its 14.4 billion dlr foreign debt.      neyra said since late 1986 peru had sought an accomodation with the world bank under which it would receive more credits than it would remit in repayments.      neyra stressed peru was not withdrawing from the world bank. the country had recently increased its capital suscription in the institution by about three mln dollars.     the bank would immediately resume loan disbursements to peru once it cleared its arrears, he said. he did not specify the value of the overdue payments. the economy ministry said peru's debt to the world bank was 521 mln dlrs at end-1985.     at the end of last year, peru's total foreign debt stood at 14.46 billion dollars, 13.17 billion dollars of which is medium- and-long-term debt, the central bank said. total arrears were 5.42 billion dollars.     central bank president leonel figueroa said peru had enough hard currency, gold and silver on hand to cover 10 or 11 months' worth of imports.     the holdings of the two precious metals and the hard currencies were valued at 2.172 billion dlrs on may 22, 1987, he said.     gross reserves were slightly lower at 1.857 billion dlrs because this classification did not include silver holdings and undervalued the central bank's gold.     reserves were projected to fall at most 150 mln dlrs this year, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
