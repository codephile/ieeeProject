	<h3>u.s. agriculture department animal health officials are conducting a national survey of live-bird markets and auctions to check for signs of avian influenza, an infectious viral disease of poultry, the department said.     the survey will locate poultry dealers and live-bird markets that sell live birds directly to the consumer and once the dealers and markets are identified, there will be tests to determine any past or present exposure to avian influenza viruses, it said.     in 1983-84, an outbreak of avian influenza in pennsylvania, maryland, virginia and new jersey cost taxpayers 65 mln dlrs to control and required the destruction of more than 17 mln birds, it said.     the survey is expected to be completed by april 15.  reuter &#3;</h3>
