	<h3>brazil will only lift the partial moratorium on its 113-billion-dlr foreign debt after an accord is reached with the private banks, the finance ministry said in a statement.     the statement said such agreement, currently being negotiated, must place the debt "within the terms proposed by brazil on september 25."     brazil proposed to the private creditors a refinancing of the interest on its foreign debt that have expired or will expire up to 1989, totalling an overall 10.4 billion dlrs.     brazil also proposed the end of spreads and conversion into bonds of part of the 70-billion dlrs owed to private banks.     brazil in february stopped interest payments on about 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks, and the ministry statement issued on monday said this would only be lifted "when an accord is reached."     the statement said that a token payment, which banks want from the brazil as a condition to discuss an agreement, "will only be made when there is a major progress in the negotiations."     meanwhile, a world bank mission arrived on monday to analyse the performance of the brazilian economy after the new plan launched in july by finance minister luiz carlos bresser pereira.  reuter &#3;</h3>
