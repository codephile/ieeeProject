	<h3>soybeans produced in the united states face a competitive price problem because of the loan rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill, u.s. undersecretary of agriculture daniel amstutz said.     amstutz told a house agriculture appropriations subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a "squeeze" because the farm bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates while limiting the soybean reduction.     as a result, he said u.s.-produced soybeans "have a price problem" in competing with other soybean producing countries.     amstutz called the situation a "dilemma" for the usda, and said "we have spent hours in ascs (agriculture stabilization and conservation service) looking at this."     he did not say what may be done to rectify the situation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
