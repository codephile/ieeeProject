	<h3>international rubber organisation (inro) buffer stock manager aldo hofmeister said tests had shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, but acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it.     "we have said all along that the rubber is holding up well from a condition and quality standpoint...rubber stored in proper conditions does not deteriorate," he told reuters in a telephone interview. the quality of buffer stock rubber sold since he entered the market in september would be discussed at an inro council meeting which opened here today, he said.     tokyo traders said on friday they had little interest in buying rubber from the inro buffer stock because of possible poor quality.     hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the "may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. inro's five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on october 16. he said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock was uppermost in consumers' minds.     "we have received good interest for the rubber. i understand the japanese concern. many consumers want to try the rubber before they carry on buying," he said.     hofmeister said inro rubber was stored in 28 different locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.     selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the past week to 10 days and this could reflect a "wait and see attitude" by buyers, he said.     "consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts until they test out the rubber. if their tests are positiive, they are likely to buy more." hofmeister said he could reduce the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest but inro did not want to depress prices artificially.     hofmeister declined to comment on japanese trade estimates that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in kuala lumpur and new york since september.     but he said japanese traders were in a position to have an idea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.     the question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the council meeting which is scheduled to end on thursday.     the current international rubber pact expires on october 22.     the deadline for the new pact's start is january 1989 and hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during the interim period.  reuter &#3;</h3>
