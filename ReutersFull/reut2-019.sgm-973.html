	<h3>more leading u.s. manufacturers plan to increase the proportion of their u.s.-based production vis-a-vis their overseas output over the next two years, according to a boston university school of management survey.     the manufacturing roundtable 1987 study showed 32 pct of manufacturers plan to shift output to their domestic plants from their overseas ones, or simply increase the production in their u.s. plants.     that was up from 19 pct expecting to make that shift in 1986, and only 12 pct in 1984.     the boston university survey canvassed 207 firms.     the largest group of those surveyed, 44 pct, planned no changes in their u.s./overseas operations, while 23.7 pct said they would boost the ratio of overseas output, the poll said.     jeffrey miller, professor at the school of management and director of the roundtable survey, said that exchange rates favored plans toward increased domestic production. but he added that increased competitiveness seems to be behind the move towards greater production in the united states.     "what's peculiar about this group is that it's the most successful in terms of profitability, decreasing costs, and increasing quality," he told reuters in an interview.     those companies increasing offshore production are at the opposite end of the spectrum, he said, not meeting the production goals they set for themselves.     he cautioned that the survey was skewed towards large, unusually profitable businesses representing a diversity of industries and regions. the typical respondent was a large manufacturing division with sales of about 200 mln dlrs.      reuter &#3;</h3>
