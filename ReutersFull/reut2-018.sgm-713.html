	<h3>global yield fund, in a review of its dividend policy, told shareholders that under the internal revenue code of 1986, the fund must distribute substantially all of its net income by the end of each year.     under the new tax law, the company said annual net income includes net investment income from interest less expenses, plu or minus any ordinary currency gains or losses realized in connection with the sale of debt securities.         the company said its present dividend policy is to make distributions of net investment income to stockholders quarterly and to accumulate any realized ordinary currency gains for distribution as net income at the end of the year.     at present time, the company said such currency gains amount to about 40 cts per share.     however, any currency net loss realized during the remaining six and a half month period between now and the end of the year could not only reduce or eliminate distributions from this source but could reduce distributions from net investment income, the company said.         according to global, the board would determine on an annual basis whether to distribute or retain net long-term realized capital gains.     in other matters, the company said its shareholders at its first annual meeting elected nine directors, approved the investment management agreement with <prudential insurance co of america>, and the service agreement between prudential and the <prudential investment corp>.         shareholders also approved the administration agreement with <prudential-bache securities inc> and amended the fund's investment restrictions to permit the purchase of portfolio securities while borrowings are outstanding, the company said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
