	<h3>european commission president jacques delors, quoted by le monde newspaper, said he favoured a franco-german candidate to take over <cie generale de constructions telephoniques>, which has a 16 pct stake in the french public telephone switching market.     "i wish for a european solution ... that will enable germany and france to move closer together, which is currently necessary," he was quoted as saying.     "given the situtation of the ec (european community) and of the importance for our future connunications audiences and of cooperation already undertaken on the community level, that seems the best choice," delors added.     five groups, including an alliance between west germany's siemens ag <sieg.f> and france's schneider s.a. <schn.pa> subsidiary jeumont-schneider, have applied to buy what is france's second largest telephone switching firm.     under french privatisation law, foreign companies are restricted to a 20 pct stake in privatised companies.  reuter &#3;</h3>
