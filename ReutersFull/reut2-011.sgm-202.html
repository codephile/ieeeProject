	<h3>today's liberalised financial markets are making it extremely difficult for japan's monetary authorities to prevent the yen's rise against the dollar, but they have several options other than normal intervention, bank of japan sources said.     a senior central bank official said that such methods as controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, which have not been invoked since 1978, are all being considered.     "but the time may not be ripe," he said.     "in this era of financial liberalisation, it's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of japan," said another senior bank official.     but the first official said: "from a technical viewpoint, the bank of japan could activate swap agreements immediately after other central banks involved agreed to do so."     a swap agreement, an exchange of currency between two nations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the other's currency in case of need.     "if the bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announce the decision jointly," said the first official.     the sources said they believed the limit of currency market intervention may be being reached after they saw recent concerted market action by central banks of major industrial nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the battered dollar.     but intervention is at least an option, they said. further easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an official discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, they said.     bank of japan governor satoshi sumita has repeatedly ruled out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation.     one bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of the bank of japan activating currency swap agreements with the u.s. and other central banks, if these banks continue intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run out of their yen cash positions.     "but we don't think they have become short of yen quite yet," he said.     the bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with the u.s. federal reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200 billion yen limit with the west german and swiss central banks, according to the sources.     foreign exchange dealers estimate the fed had sold two billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the dollar in new york last week.     the central bank sources also said japan may arrange other currency swap agreements with britain and france if they find it necessary, but added they are not actually talking with each other towards that end.  reuter &#3;</h3>
