	<h3>the american stock exchange said it is prepared to move settlement prices for its broad-based stock index contracts to the stock market opening on expiration fridays providing the change is part of an industry-wide move to a uniform system.     "we believe it is in the best interests of the industry for all markets to participate  in a coordinated move to base expiration friday settlement prices on the stock market opening," amex president kenneth leibler said in a statmenet.     he said non-uniform procedures will lead to "market and investor confusion."     leibler said expirations based on openings "appears to offer greater opportunities than the close to most efficiently handle any order imbalances which may occur on expiration fridays."     he said the markets would have the remainder of the trading day to correct any "price dislocations" that occur. market analysts have attributed some wide swings in the stock market in part to arbitrage activity involving index options and futures and individual stocks.     options on the major market index and the institutional index, which now expire at the close, are traded on the amex.  reuter &#3;</h3>
