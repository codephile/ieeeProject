	<h3>shifts from mild to very cold weather in east germany damaged winter barley and late sown winter wheat in central regions and barley north of berlin, the u.s. agricultural officer in east berlin said.     in a field report, the officer said indications were that winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared with 38,000 last year.     he said the damage was probably more limited in southern and central regions and most widespread in the north.     damage was most severe on plants above the ground where little or no snow cover was present, he added.     the officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well developed plants and for winter barley.     furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing water occurred in the fields.     the officer said repairing damage will probably call for special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and where stands are thin. harrowing, as well as well-timed applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
