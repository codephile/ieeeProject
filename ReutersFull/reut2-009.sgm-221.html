	<h3>the ministry of international trade and industry (miti) has asked about 30 japanese trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading house officials said.     the officials told reuters miti asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. it made the request by telephone.     a miti official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. but he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling.     the trading house officials said miti had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy.     the miti official said miti undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely. a similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on january 19. it hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday.     he said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall.  reuter &#3;</h3>
