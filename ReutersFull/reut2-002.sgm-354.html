	<h3>world bank president barber conable said he believed that brazil would come up with a medium term economic plan and that the current debt moritorium would be temporary.     speaking briefly to reporters following an address before the export-import bank, conable said that the bank had been urging the brazilian government to come up with a specific plan designed to work the country out of its present economic difficulty.     "brazil would like to come up with such a plan," he said, adding: "the moritorium is likely to be a temporary affair."     during his formal remarks, conable made it clear that he believed brazil must take some specific internal action.     he said "they have everyone's attention but it must be followed by a construtive plan."     he said that he expected brazilian finance minister dilson funaro, who he met with last week to discuss the brazilian debt suspension action, to return for further discussion but did not currently have a specific meeting arranged.     conable also told the gathering of mostly commericial bankers that in order for the baker debt initiative to work all parties to the program must be on board.  reuter &#3;</h3>
