	<h3>west german industrial production, seasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in february after a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in january, the economics ministry said.     the ministry had originally estimated that industrial production fell 3.0 pct in january.     the february figure is likely to be revised upwards by just under one percentage point next month when the march figure is released, a ministry statement said.     the industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a provisional 104.1 in february against 100.9 in january and 104.5 in december. the ministry had previously put the january and december indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.     in february 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7, producing a year-on-year rise for february 1987 of 0.4 pct.     the february rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct increase in construction output compared with january, when production in many industrial sectors was depressed by unusually severe winter weather.     manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in production in february compared with january. but energy sector output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.     the ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be a better guide to trends, said output in january and february together fell around two pct against november and december.     the ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in january/february against november/december due to the cold january weather. output in the energy sector rose four pct and mining output 10 pct.     manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in january/february compared with november/december.     within this sector, the output of both basic products and of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. production of capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was unchanged.     compared with the same months of 1986, industrial production in january and february 1987 fell 1-1/2 pct, the ministry said.     manufacturing industry output fell one pct, with output of basic products down three pct, capital goods down one pct and food, tobacco and alcohol production 1-1/2 pct lower. makers of consumer goods posted a 1-1/2 pct year-on-year rise in the two-month period.     in other industrial sectors, mining production fell four pct and construction output 4-1/2 pct. the energy sector saw a slight 1/2 pct rise, the ministry added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
