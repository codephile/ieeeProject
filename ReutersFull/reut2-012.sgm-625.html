	<h3>comdisco inc expects record earnings for the second quarter ended march 31 in the range of 65 to 75 cts a share, chairman kenneth pontikes said in remarks prepared for delivery to a group of los angeles financial executives.     in the year-earlier second quarter, comdisco reported earnings of 40 cts a share.     pontikes reiterated that earnings for the full fiscal year should be "at record levels of 2.10 dlrs to 2.25 dlrs a share compared with 1.91 dlrs a share a year ago."     comdisco said the anticipated higher earnings are the result of strong performance by its risk arbitrage subsidiary and increased profitability from the marketing of its lease portfolio and its disaster recovery services.     it said the loss incurred from risk arbitrage activities in the first fiscal quarter of 1987 has been completely recovered.  reuter &#3;</h3>
