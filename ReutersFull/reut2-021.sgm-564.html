	<h3>new zealand has imposed sanctions against fiji in response to that country's change of status to a republic, acting prime minister geoffrey palmer said.     the sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut economic aid. new zealand will also not renew an agreement which supports the price of fijian sugar when it expires in march. the loss of aid and sugar supports will cost fiji about 10 mln dlrs a year.     palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government had asked high commissioner rod gates to return from suva for discussions about other possible measures.     "we won't be reacting further until these discussions with the high commissioner and the prime minister have been held," palmer said.     the sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after colonel sitivene rabuka staged his second coup on september 25. implementation was postponed in the hope that rabuka might turn back from declaring a republic.     palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from commonwealth leaders in vancouver that fiji's membership of the commonwealth had lapsed. prime minister david lange is in hawaii on his way home from vancouver.  reuter &#3;</h3>
