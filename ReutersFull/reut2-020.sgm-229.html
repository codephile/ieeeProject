	<h3>president reagan sent the five-year international natural rubber agreement to the senate for approval.     reagan said the accord is designed to stabilize rubber prices without disturbing long-term market trends and to foster expanded natural rubber supplies at reasonable prices.     it continues a buffer stock of not more than 550,000 tonnes established by a 197agreement. this will be used to defend a regularly adjusted price range and will be financed equally by importing and exporting members of the agreement.  reuter &#3;</h3>
