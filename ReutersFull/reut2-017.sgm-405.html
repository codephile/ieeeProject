	<h3>the u.s. economy has peaked and will slow to a growth rate of between 2.5 pct and three pct for the remainder of 1987, first boston corp managing director albert wojnilower said.     he told an investment conference the u.s. economy will not be able to sustain the 4.3 pct growth rate recorded in first quarter gross national product.     he said continued intermittent attacks on the u.s. currency could lead to a substantial rise in long term interest rates. however, he predicted that rates will eventually decline either in anticipation of a recession or because of one.   reuter &#3;</h3>
