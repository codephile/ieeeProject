	<h3>the international primary market association's new rules for lead managers of fixed rate dollar bonds will take effect on june 15, an ipma official said.     the new ipma rules require a lead manager to quote firm prices at which it will buy and sell newly issued bonds for 12 months after the launch. the rules were first proposed march 27.     christopher sibson, secretary general of ipma, said the rules are not expected to have a noticeable impact on the market because they only apply to dollar denominated bonds, which have been scarce recently.     this year, euroyen issuance has outstripped dollar bonds.     sibson said that the rules are intended to provide greater liquidity in the new issues market where underwriters sometimes step away from deals they have managed if the market moves away from them.     however, he noted that the ipma rules are voluntary and the organization has no authority to enforce them.     sibson said that similar rules for new issues denominated in other currencies will be put into effect later, following consultation with the association of international bond dealers, another trade organization.  reuter &#3;</h3>
