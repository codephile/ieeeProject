	<h3>financial corp of america said it is not holding discussions with anyone regarding a buyout of the company.     but a spokeswoman pointed out that financial corp has said publicly for nearly two years that in the company's view a merger would be one method of increasing the company's capital.     "if an opportunity arises for us to strengthen our capital position quickly we would be very open to it," the spokeswoman said.     financial corp would need over one billion dlrs to bring its regulatory net worth up to federal savings and loan insurance corp requirements, the spokeswoman said.     in addition, she said that the federal home loan bank board, in a letter dated january 26, 1987, stated that through march 31, 1988 it will continue to support the company's efforts to restructure its balance sheet, maintain profitable operations and augment net worth.  reuter &#3;</h3>
