	<h3>resorts international inc said it filed with the new jersey casino control commission to consolidate the hotel and related operation of the resorts international casino with the company's taj mahal casino/hotel, which is currently under construction.     the company said the plan would allow both facilities to be operated with a single casino room, located at the taj mahal, and was necessary for the financial well-being and efficiency of the operation.     the company said the existing casino portion of the resorts casino would be converted to a convention and exhibition space.     the company said the petition also requests the approval of a comprehensive services agreement between resorts and <trump hotel corp>, which is controlled by donald j. trump.     under the agreement, trump hotel agrees to provide a comprehensive range of services including marketing, management, and construction and development to resorts, the company said.     the company said the agreement also provides for the non-exclusive license to resorts to use the trump name and other trademarkes and service marks in connection with the operations and marketing of resorts properties.     the terms of the agreement call for trump hotel to receive an annual services fee of 1-3/4 pct of resorts adjusted gross revenue and 15 pct of its adjusted net income, the company said. additionally, trump hotel will receive a fee equal to three pct of the post july 21, 1987 construction costs of the taj mahal, the company said.     the company said the proposed consolidation and the service agreement were both unanimously approved by a committee of three independent resorts directors.  reuter &#3;</h3>
