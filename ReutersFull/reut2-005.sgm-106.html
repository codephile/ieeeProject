	<h3>john labatt ltd said its share of the canadian beer market is holding at more than 41 pct but the total market has grown only three pct since last year when volumes were depressed by labor disruptions in the industry.     labatt earlier reported profits in the third quarter ended january 31 rose 20 pct to 26.2 mln dlrs from 21.8 mln a year earlier, while nine month earnings were up almost as much to 92.8 mln dlrs from 78 mln dlrs.     "through acquisitions as well as growth in the core businesses, all segments achieved both sales and earnings improvement over a year ago," it said.     labatt purchased tuscan dairies, green spring dairy, everfresh juice co and pasquale food co in the third quarter.     the company said cool wet weather last summer slowed total market demand in the past nine months. "lack of significant market growth emphasizes the importance of customer service and new product development," it added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
