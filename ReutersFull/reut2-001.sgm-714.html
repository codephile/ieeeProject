	<h3>colombian finance minister cesar gaviria blamed an inflexible u.s. position for the failure of last week's international coffee organisation, ico, talks on export quotas.     "we understand that the u.s. position was more inflexible than the one of brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," gaviria told reuters in an interview.     the u.s. and brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in london.     gaviria stressed that colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the london talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible.     in a conversation later with local journalists, gaviria said the u.s. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like colombia but certainly for other latin american nations and for some african countries.     he told reuters that colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.     according to gaviria, colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue.     that estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986.     colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last september 30.  reuter &#3;</h3>
