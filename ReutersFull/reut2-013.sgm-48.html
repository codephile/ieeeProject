	<h3>boeing co. <ba> is trying to find out what caused an engine brace to snap on one of japan air line's 747-sr jumbo jets, a spokesman for the airplane manufacturer said.     "we know about the problem and we have provided a service advisory to operators of 747s," said the spokesman. "we are not advising any massive inspections at this time."     the advisory alerts operators of the jumbo jets that a problem has occurred and under what circumstances, but it does not recommend any action.     "a 'service bulletin' would be sent out if there is anything they should be concerned about," the spokesman said.     a jal spokesman in toyko said inspectors making a routine check found one of three diagonal braces attaching an engine to the wing of a 747-sr had snapped due to metal fatigue.     the airlines said it had ordered an inspection of all 11 of its 747-sr's. the plane is a full-sized jumbo jet that has been modified slightly to handle short-haul routes in japan, mainly between tokyo and osaka.     the jetliners have beefed-up landing gear to accommodate a higher-than-normal number of landings and takeoffs.     boeing's spokesman said only jal and all nippon airlines use the 747-sr. jal took delivery of its first 747-sr in 1973 and purchased two more last year. he said the braces had been shipped to a boeing plant near seattle where they were being inspected.  reuter &#3;</h3>
