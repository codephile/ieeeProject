	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it may cut piedmont aviation inc's bbb-minus preferred stock because of usair group inc's <u> proposed acquisition of the airline.     while the combination would strengthen both airlines' market position and enhance revenue generating capability, usair group would require substantial debt to finance the 1.6 billion dlr acquisition, s and p said.     usair's balance sheet and cash flow support of debt, among the strongest in the industry, would be weakened by financing all-cash acquisitions of piedmont and psa inc. usair's a-rated senior debt is already on s/p watch for possible downgrade.  reuter &#3;</h3>
