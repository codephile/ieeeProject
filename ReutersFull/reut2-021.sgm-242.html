	<h3>the senate agriculture committee was expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and wheat acreage reduction requirements, senate staff said.     a budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman patrick leahy (d-vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate differentials to no more than one pct per year from the national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.     the plan also would allow the agriculture secretary to increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by "an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected corn stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.     leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.  reuter &#3;</h3>
