	<h3>the world bank said it approved a 90 mln dlr loan to yugoslavia's third largest bank to support a project promoting energy conservation and substituting lower-cost energy sources for present sources.     it said the loan consists of a credit line to ljubljanska banka, ljubljana (lbl), to finance a project expected to improve industrial competitiveness and reduce energy imports, easing the country's current balance-of-payments difficulties.     the bank said the project will benefit small and medium-sized industries, primarily in yugoslavia's republic of slovenia.     it said 600,000 dlrs of the loan will cover the foreign exchange costs of consultancy services, equipment and training abroad for technical and financial personnel.  reuter &#3;</h3>
