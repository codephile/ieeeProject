	<h3>u.s. exports of edible groundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year to september 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, trading company tracomin sa said.     it revised its december 1986 forecast that exports would total 205,000 tonnes, citing low demand, the loss of u.s. market share in the two main importing countries, britain and the netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at a premium in the u.s. domestic market.     tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 crop at 215,000 tonnes compared with 264,000 the previous year.     tracomin said it expects a good 1987 u.s. groundnut crop and forecast a resurgence in u.s. exports next year.     "barring any market manipulations, a good u.s. harvest in 1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and the reappearance of the u.s.a as the world's leading producer of peanuts," it said.     overall exports from china, the leading exporter last year, will remain at exceptionally high levels this year despite quality complaints and difficulties in implementing some earlier high-priced contracts. it is too early to say if china can retain its current market share in 1988, tracomin said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
