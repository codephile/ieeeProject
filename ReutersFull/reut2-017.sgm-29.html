	<h3>the securities and exchange commission reminded securities dealers that its mark-up disclosure requirements also applies to transactions on zero-coupon securities.     dealers and brokers are required by u.s. securities law to disclose their mark-ups if they are excessive, the sec said in a public notice.     further, excessive mark-ups on securities transactions, whether disclosed or not, violate the rules of the national association of securities dealers inc and municipal securities rulemaking board, it said.     in a separate action, the sec filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a private civil case involving a complaint against merrill lynch over excessive mark-ups on zero-coupon bonds. the case is being appealed to the u.s. appeals court.     the lower court dismissed the complaint, finding antifraud provisions of securities laws do not prohibit undisclosed excessive mark-ups on securities transactions.     the sec is urging the appeals court to reverse the decision, citing its nearly 50 year-old position that undisclosed excessive mark-ups by securities dealers violate the general antifraud provisions of securities laws.  reuter &#3;</h3>
