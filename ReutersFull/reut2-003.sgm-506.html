	<h3>foreign oil companies will spend less on exploration in indonesia this year than last, budgeting 2.7 billion dlrs for calendar 1987 against 1986 spending of 2.8 billion dlrs, the state oil company pertamina said.     actual spending last year fell short of the budgeted figure of 3.2 billion dlrs, as oil companies slashed expenditure because of the crash in world oil prices.     jumardi jukardi, head of pertamina's coordinating board for foreign contractors, said foreign companies will drill 110 exploration wells and 431 development wells this year, against 108 and 330 last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
