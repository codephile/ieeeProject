	<h3>a bank of japan spokesman declined to comment on a press report that the central bank had decided to conduct closer scrutiny of the operations of financial institutions in the bond market.     the jiji press news agency had quoted bank of japan sources as telling japanese reporters the bank was deeply concerned over potential risk in yen bond trading because the market had risen too fast.     however, jiji quoted the sources as saying, the central bank would not take such actions as guiding interest rates higher.     jiji quoted the sources as saying that current bond market yields are similar to short-term interest rates due to excessive speculative operations.     this was attributable to heavy redemptions of government bonds and unclear prospects for the dollar, which has sent many foreign bond market participants to the domestic market, the sources were quoted as saying.  reuter &#3;</h3>
