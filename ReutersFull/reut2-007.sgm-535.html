	<h3>finance minister kiichi miyazawa said japan plans to announce a package of economic measures immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes parliament.     the passage of the full budget is expected after may 20 as the government has decided to compile a 50-day stop-gap budget for the year starting april 1. an opposition boycott over a proposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business.     miyazawa told a press conference prime minister yasuhiro nakasone is unlikely to take the package to washington.     nakasone hopes to meet president reagan in late april or early may to prepare for the venice economic summit in june.     asked if he planned to visit the u.s. to attend monetary conferences including international monetary fund meetings in early april, miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on the matter, taking into account parliament debate.     the package is likely to include a record amount of public works spending in the first 1987/88 half, miyazawa said.     miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8,800 billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1,800 billion for public works. japan expects the stop-gap budget to help spur the economy, miyazawa said.     miyazawa said the government and the ruling liberal democratic party will seek the passage of the bills related to the controversial sales tax without any revision.     japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks by a top government official as indicating a revision of the tax but the official did not mean that, miyazawa said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
