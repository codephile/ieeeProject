	<h3>two world bank review teams are in the philippines to assess government requests for funding for an expanded housing plan and an accelerated land reform program, bank officials said.     they told reuters the housing program loan request is for 100 mln to 150 mln dlrs.     the government has said it will ask for another 500 mln dlr long-term loan from a world bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors to partially fund its land reform program.     the officials said negotiations will start next month on another 150 mln dlr loan sought by manila to carry out reforms in 14 major state-owned corporations.     on tuesday, the world bank approved two loans totalling 310 mln dlrs to help the country's economic recovery program.     the bank was also studying philippine proposals for loans to finance geothermal and education projects, sources said.     world bank sources said the bank's lending to the philippines since 1957, including the latest loan, totalled 4.3 billion dlrs. the money has been spread out over more than 100 loans and about 1.2 billion dlrs remains undisbursed.     the world bank sources said the bank cancelled 450 mln dlrs in loan commitments to the philippines during the last three years of president ferdinand marcos's rule. marcos was toppled by a military-civilian revolt in february 1986.     "the loans were cancelled because the projects slated for aid were not implemented properly," they said.     the sources said the bulk of this week's loan would be used to rehabilitate the state-owned development bank of the philippines (dbp) and the philippine national bank (pnb) which are saddled with seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.     "at least 300 mln dlrs of previously cancelled loans were supposed to go to the dbp," the world bank sources said. "over the past three years the bank's disbursement pipeline to the philippines almost completely dried up."     in 1986 alone, the two banks paid out 16 billion pesos in loan repayments, about 59 pct of the government's budget deficit of 27 billion pesos for the year, they said.     agreement on the latest loan was reached in principle last september when president corazon aquino visited the u.s. the sources said the loan was held up because of delays by the government in submitting essential documents.     the world bank sources said the request for land reform funding would be discussed at a meeting of the world bank-led consultative group to be held alongside the april 27-29 annual meeting of the asian development bank (adb) in osaka.     the government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished peasants.     the sources said the philippine government estimated the entire program would cost 60 billion pesos. "about 27 billion is long-term and will cover land transfer costs borne mainly by landowners," they said. "the landowners will be paid in 10-year bonds redeemable in ten instalments."     the sources said the bulk of financing would cover development costs for the land program and help to bridge the gap between the 10-year spread of payments to landowners and a proposed 30-year loan repayment period for land buyers.     "if you include interest, the total amount of external assistance needed annually should not exceed 200 mln dlrs," the sources said. "that volume of aid does not appear difficult."     they said japan, the world bank and the adb are expected to provide most of the financing while the philippines' 12 bilateral aid donors would contribute the rest.     the world bank sources said lending to the philippines is designed to support its balance of payments position while the government aims for a target of six to seven pct annual gross national product growth.     "brazil did not do this homework," one said. "they pushed ahead with a recovery program without ensuring backing for their balance of payments position. manila is being more cautious and aims at soft borrowings which, it is hoped, will be outstripped by annual growth rates and eventually result in the country emerging from debt in five or six years."     philippine foreign debt is currently 27.8 billion dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
