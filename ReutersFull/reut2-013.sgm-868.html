	<h3>shifts in domestic economic policy, not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, dutch finance miniister h. onno ruding said.     ruding told a meeting of the world trade forum here that protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate the problems of heavily indebted developing countries.     "the main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous u.s. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country."     "no, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic economic and financial policies," ruding said.     ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the weakening dollar than he was in january before the paris accord to stabilize foreign exchange rates.     he said the highest priority should be given to policy changes in the united states, especially reducing the budget deficit and encouraging domestic savings.     but he said other countries, such as japan and west germany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing their trade surpluses.  reuter &#3;</h3>
