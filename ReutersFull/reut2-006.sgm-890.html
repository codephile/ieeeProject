	<h3>the federal reserve board has approved the application of chase manhattan corp to engage in underwriting and dealing in commercial paper of chase commercial corp, the lending subsidiary of the parent bank holding company.     the fed order said chase manhattan's application was consistent with sound banking practices and existing laws. but it added a bill adopted by the senate banking committee last week could affect chase manhattan if it becomes law and might force it eventually to cease commercial paper underwriting activities.      the fed said the application was similar to that of bankers trust to engage in commercial paper placement that was approved last december.     chase manhattan corp, with consolidated assets of 90 billion dlrs, is the second largest banking organization in new york and operates in the united states and abroad.     the fed noted the securities industry association, a trade association of the investment banking industry, had opposed chase manhattan's application for more powers.     chase manhattan now will be able to underwrite commercial paper, buying it for resale to institutions like banks.      in addition, chase manhattan will be able to place commercial paper as agents for issuers and advise them on rates and maturities of proposed issues just as bankers trust was given authority to do.     the minimum denomination of commercial paper offered and purchased would be 250,000 dlrs.     the fed said it felt there would be no violation of banking laws provided that chase manhattan restricted its commercial paper activities to five pct of its income and five pct of total market share.     the fed said dealing in commercial paper was related to chase manhattan's regular banking activities because "this kind of instrument has many of the characteristics of a traditional commercial loan."     "because of its short term nature, commercial paper is customarily held to maturity -- like a commercial loan," the fed order said.     among the benefits for the public will be increased competition in the commercial paper market and more convenient service for borrowers and investors, the fed said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
