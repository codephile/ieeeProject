	<h3>ecuador is seeking between 437 and 450 mln dlrs in loans this year from multilateral organisations and foreign governments to grapple with economic losses from a devastating earthquake 13 days ago, a presidential economic adviser said.     foreign governments and multilateral organisations hold one-third of ecuador's 8.16 billion dlrs total foreign debt, he said in a news conference at the presidential palace.     but he added that the suspension of payments to private foreign banks, who hold the rest of the foreign debt, would be prolonged though the government hoped to negotiate an agreement with these creditors.     president leon febres cordero says the earthquake cost the country one billion dlrs in losses and left 1,000 people dead or missing.     swett, who was finance minister of ecuador between august 1984 to june 1986, added: "with the private foreign banks there has been a ceasing of payments by ecuador.     "we are bringing forward the respective negotiations whose conclusion we hope finalises in the next few weeks."     finance minister domingo cordovez said last week that quake-hit ecuador sought through negotiations to postpone all payments due to the private foreign banks in 1987 until next year.     although swett gave no gave details on the latest plan for negotiations with private foreign banks, he calculated the suspension of payment to these creditors would save the government 54.45 billion sucres.     this amount is equal to 363 mln dlrs at the free rate of 150 sucres to the dollar -- the rate swett said reporters should use in calculating the dollar equivalent.     the ecuadorean central bank, which is the institution remitting debt payments abroad, uses the official rate of 95 sucres to the dollar for its accounting purposes. at the official rate, the 54.45 billion sucres' sum equals 573 mln dlrs.     ecuador, squeezed by a slide last year in prices for crude, its main export, suspended payments to private foreign banks in january.     swett said the government would also seek to refinance the 1.429 billion dlr section of the debt owed to the paris club group of foreign governments, though it would continue to service the debt with them. he gave no more details.     the government adopted a tough austerity program last friday intended to grapple with the tremor's economic costs. but the country's labour unions have called a general strike for wednesday to press for a suspension of the program.     the 500,000-strong unitary workers' front (fut) and the 100,000-member general union of workers (ugt) called the strike to cancel the measures, which include a rise in petrol prices of up to 80 per cent and budget cuts of as much as 10 per cent.     the leftist-led fut said it was also backing a call by the maoist popular movement for democracy (mpd) party, to have congress impeach and oust febres cordero, a conservative, for having adopted the austerity measures.  reuter &#3;</h3>
