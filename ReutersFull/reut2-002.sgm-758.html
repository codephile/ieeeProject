	<h3>nicaraguan rebel leader adolfo calero has for the first time linked payments received for his forces to a dummy company controlled by former white house aide oliver north, legal sources said.     the company, lake resources inc, was established by north and his ally, retired air force major general richard secord, and had a swiss bank account into which proceeds from secret arms sales to iran were deposited.     calero yesterday made public bank statements showing his group has received 32 mln dlrs since mid-1984, but said he has no idea who donated the money.     calero, head of the nicaraguan democratic force, known by its spanish initials as fdn, provided the same records to a grand jury investigating the iran arms scandal that has shaken the reagan administration.     the bank statements he showed reporters ended with march, 1985, so they shed no light on whether iran arms profits were diverted to contra rebels since shipments of u.s. arms to iran did not begin until september 1985.     but last night, calero told cable news network that he had just discovered deposits made in late october, 1985 by lake resources into a contra account in the cayman islands.         this came at a time when proceeds from the iran arms sales were being funneled to the swiss bank account.     "i just found out," he said.     legal sources confirmed that calero had turned over the newly disclosed information, which was brought to his attention after one of his lawyers noticed the two desposits made by lake resources buried in the mass of bank records.     they said that calero has promised to review in more detail the bank statements and pass along any further information on possible deposits by the north-secord groups.     the tower commission said in its report that up to 19.8 mln dlrs from the sale of u.s. weapons to iran was unaccounted for and may have been diverted to the contras.     calero's fdn is the largest of the contra rebel groups that are fighting to overthrow the left-wing sandinista government of nicaragua.     on the advice of his lawyer, calero declined to go into details about what he told the grand jury.      reuter &#3;</h3>
