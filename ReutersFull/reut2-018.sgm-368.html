	<h3>brazil's new economic plan should enable brazil to renew negotiations with creditors on its 111-billion dlr foreign debt within the next 30 days, finance minister luiz carlos bresser pereira said.     the plan, which predicted the economy would grow 4.5 pct this year and inflation would drop to 10 pct a month by december from 20 pct at present, would be officially announced "within three or four weeks," he told a news conference.     the minister said he presented an outline of the program during a cabinet meeting in which president jose sarney declared "a total war" on inflation.     sarney told the meeting an austerity plan to trim government spending would be introduced.     bresser pereira said brazil faced the risk of economic recession, but he estimated the gross national product would grow 4.5 pct this year. it grew 8.3 pct last year.     its april inflation rate was a record 20.96 pct and contributed to an accumulated rate of 84.19 pct in the first four months of 1987.     bresser pereira said the economic plan would seek to keep the economy growing, to build an eight billion dlr trade surplus and to force a sharp drop in the inflation rate.  reuter &#3;</h3>
