	<h3>south africa's director-general of finance chris stals said he was optimistic about reaching a mutually acceptable agreement with foreign bank creditors in debt renegotiation talks scheduled to begin next month.     stals, the country's chief foreign debt negotiator, said "we are busy finding out how they (banks) feel. they all have different opinions. there is no consensus."     but asked if he was optimistic on agreement for a new debt repayment plan, stals replied "yes" in a telephone interview from his pretoria office.     he declined to comment further before the major review of the interim debt agreement regarding the moratorium on principal repayments on 13 billion dlrs of south africa's 24 billion dlr external debt.     the agreement on the moratorium with some 330 creditor banks expires on june 30. "we have had a series of discussions with a great number of banks both bilaterally and individually on the foreign debt situation in preparation for april," stals said.     he said no date has been set for the meeting and declined to comment on published reports in the past few months that banks may demand accelerated repayments.     banking sources here said only an escalation of south african political unrest would increase foreign pressure on repayments.     finance minister barend du plessis said last month that in the forthcoming talks south africa would give a fair deal to all creditors but not agree to "unrealistic demands."  reuter &#3;</h3>
