	<h3>with the death of sen. edward zorinsky (d-neb.), midwestern grain farmers have lost an ally who from his senior post on the senate agriculture committee had fought hard against cutbacks in farm benefits.     zorinsky's passing could trim the democrats' majority in the senate and change the makeup of the senate farm panel.     zorinsky, who died of a heart attack last friday, was the second-ranking democrat on the senate agriculture committee and chairman of the crucial subcommittee on agricultural production and stabilization of prices.     once a republican, zorinsky was fiscal conservative. but he was an outspoken critic of reagan administration proposals to trim target prices, and at the time of his death was girding himself for another push for mandatory supply controls.     if melcher decides, however, to continue as chairman of the subcommittee on agricultural research, conservation, forestry and general legislation, other democrats would have a crack at the vacated chairmanship.     by order of seniority, those senators would be david pryor (ark.), david boren (okla.), howell heflin (ala.) and tom harkin (d-iowa), a forceful advocate of mandatory supply controls.  reuter &#3;</h3>
