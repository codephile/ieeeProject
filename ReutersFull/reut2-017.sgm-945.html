	<h3>the finance ministry would raise lending limits on local non-life insurance firms to meet the increasing need for efficient fund management, a ministry spokesman said.     he said the allowable non-collateral lending limits would be increased to 30 pct of each insurer's total assets from 25 pct and that overseas subsidiaries will be made eligible as borrowers.     the lending limit for non-life insurers which do not satisfy criteria for making non-collateral loans would be expanded to three pct of total assets from one pct.     the upper limit of lending of securities by non-life insurance companies, now set at five pct of each insurer's total assets would be abolished, the official said.     this will enable such lending by non-life insurers to be included in the separate category of money lending, which is limited to 55 pct of the total assets of each insurer.     approvals for the changes, which must be given to each insurer on application, were expected to begin soon, possibly as early as next week.  reuter &#3;</h3>
