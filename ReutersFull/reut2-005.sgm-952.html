	<h3>massey combines corp, 45 pct owned by varity corp, said it shipped 48 large conventional combines valued at nearly five mln canadian dlrs to its saudi arabian distributor, located in riyadh.     massey combines said the combines shipment is the company's first major sale in saudi arabia since the sharp drop in world oil prices forced many oil-producing countries to curb machinery imports.     massey combines, formerly varity's combines division, became an independent business during a company restructuring completed last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
