	<h3>turkey's banks are reporting a strong recovery in 1986 profits, but a government drive to liberalise capital markets poses new challenges to a banking industry seeking to broaden its earnings base.     a dozen of turkey's 55 banks have announced higher 1986 profits so far, a trend bankers in the financial capital of istanbul expect to be reflected through most of the industry.     but while ankara's policy of liberalising markets offers new opportunites to expand operations, some bankers see dangers attached to a related drive to push down turkish interest rates.     bankers said the government's policy of fostering lower interest rates could lead to a consumer boom and reignite inflation, currently running at about 30 pct. they worry that this could further reduce the industry's shrinking deposit base.     this has given added urgency to bank moves to build up their capital market operations as turkey's market-oriented prime minister turgut ozal liberalises the financial system.     bankers said the 1986 recovery in earnings stemmed partly from foreign exchange operations and trade finance. but a growing volume of trading in government securities is now also a major source of revenue for banks.     bankers said the proportion of bank profits generated from the traditional financing of commerce and industry is falling, and some have even been making a loss on these operations.     the major challenge to bank profits in turkey came in 1980 when the government, faced with its worst financial crisis in 50 years, raised domestic interest rates sharply to fight an inflation rate of over 100 pct and launched an export drive.     deniz gokce, associate professor of economics at the bosphorus university, told reuters that banks were forced to pay depositors real interest rates for the first time and profits started to fall. previously, rates had been below inflation.     turkey's domestic banks also partly missed out on the export drive as foreign banks moved into istanbul and reaped the benefits of trade finance with their added expertise. the number of foreign banks has risen to 16 from just two in 1981.     although local banks tried to follow suit, turkey's exports declined last year to 7.4 billion dlrs from 7.9 billion in 1985 and bankers doubt there is enough business to go round.     as a result banks, including a few foreign operations, have started moving into capital market operations to broaden their earnings base and take advantage of the relaunch just over a year ago of the istanbul stock exchange.     "when we saw that there was a demand and supply of money outside the banking system, we could not envisage ourselves excluded from these transactions," said osman erk, deputy general manager of the private bank yapi ve kredi bankasi as.     the number of banks active at the exchange, mainly trading government securities, went up to 28 this year from 23 when the market was revived in december 1985.     liberalisation went one step further last week when parliament passed a law encouraging companies to go public. last month, yapi ve kredi bankasi launched the country's first commercial paper programme, for a joint-venture chemical firm.     medium-sized private pamukbank as announced a strong recovery in 1986 pre-tax profit to 12.9 billion lira from 603 mln in 1985, while yapi ve kredi bankasi profits increased to 30.6 billion lira from 6.1 billion. bankers said both benefited from trade finance and increased capital market operations.     turkey's second biggest bank, the private turkiye is bankasi, announced a profit rise to 35 billion from 32.3 billion in 1985.     however, bankers said some banks have been "window dressing" their balance sheets to mask non-performing loans which are variously estimated by bankers at between 20 to 50 pct of the industry's 9,026 billion lira in total credits.     non-performing loans began to mount in the early 1980s as industry failed to cope with higher interest rates and started to default. some banks continued to count loans as performing.     "after 1984 all banks started to be more careful in giving credits, so the non-performing loans is a problem of the period between 1980 to 1984," erk said.     but the problem of bad loans led to a rescue by three state banks of medium-sized turkiye ogretmenler bankasi as earlier this year when the treasury, which acts as a watchdog body over banks, discovered that the its assets were to a large extent made up of non-performing loans.     some 51 billion lira out of the bank's 69 billion lira loan portfolio was non-performing. but the bank had reported a 1986 pre-tax profit of 65 mln lira.     bankers cited this as a typical example of how balance sheets could hide problems despite a drive by the central bank to standardise accounting.     gokce said the only solution would be for compulsory auditing by international accounting companies.  reuter &#3;</h3>
