	<h3>house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have president reagan's support.     he told a national press club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget.     however, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.     there have been calls in congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.     reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases.     on trade issues, rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any u.s. industry for special protection.     "to go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide," he said.     this apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was proposed again this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
