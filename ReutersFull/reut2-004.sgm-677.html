	<h3>kampuchea harvested more than two mln tonnes of rice paddy in 1986, up on the crops of the previous two years, the official spk news agency said yesterday.     diplomats said estimates put the 1985 harvest at less than one mln tonnes, slightly up on 800,000 in 1984.     spk said kampuchea planned to expand planting from 1.5 mln to 1.93 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 2.5 mln tonnes this calendar year.     two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 1.3 mln tonnes of milled rice, above the 1.25 mln tonnes kampuchea says is the minimum its 7.5 mln people need.  reuter &#3;</h3>
