	<h3>the securities and exchange commission began proceedings in which it will consider allowing options trading on exchange-listed securities on more than one options market.     in a three-nil decision, the sec voted to seek public comment on a proposed rule removing restrictions that prevent the options from being traded on more than one market.     exclusive trading rights in options on exchange-listed stocks are now determined by a lottery system among options exchanges.     the sec also voted to ask the new york, american, chicago board options, pacific and philadelphia exchanges to voluntarily postpone an options allocation lottery scheduled for june 22 while the matter is under consideration.     richard ketchum, head of the sec's division of market regulation, said the exchanges are not required to adhere to the request.  reuter &#3;</h3>
