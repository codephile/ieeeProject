	<h3>mcorp said it plans to convert 35 of its 62 member banks to branches during the next nine months.     it said it expects the conversions, pending regulatory approval of branching applications, will provide substantial long-term benefits for its customers and shareholders.     in connection with the conversions, mcorp said it also has realigned its operating structure and named eight group chairmen.     it said the group chairmen, with its chairman and president, will comprise its management committee.  reuter &#3;</h3>
