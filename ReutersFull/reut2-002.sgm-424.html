	<h3>a house agriculture committee meeting to draft a disaster aid bill containing a controversial 0/92 provision has been postponed until next tuesday, committee staff members announced.     the bill contains a provision implementing a 0/92 acreage reduction plan for 1986 wheat and 1987 winter wheat, thereby making payments available to farmers who were not able to plant last year's winter wheat crop because of flooding.     controversy exists over whether the 0/92 provisions of the bill should be expanded, cut back or left as is.  reuter &#3;</h3>
