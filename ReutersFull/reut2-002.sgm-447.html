	<h3>delegates from the national pork producers council, nppc, attending the american pork congress in indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the u.s. congress not to change the farm bill. while there are no specific pork items in that legislation, feed grain prices directly affect pork producer profits, the nppc said.     don gingerich, a delegate from iowa, said "to have unpredictable changes come along periodically makes it very difficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption."     other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but that's a price pork producers are willing to pay for legislative stability, an nppc spokesman said.     delegates also passed unanimously a resolution that congress and the administration should act swiftly to identify problems in the farm credit system.     farm credit task force chairman and newly elected vice president of the nppc ray hankes, said delegates wanted a program that all commodity groups can work with and bring a  resolution to this problem with legislators in washington.     hankes added that the national pork producers council will work to save farmers and keep credit available, but not to save or create any one credit system.   reuter &#3;</h3>
