	<h3>japan agreed in talks with the u.s. to amend its laws to allow more companies to engage in international value-added network telecommunications services, a post and telecommunications ministry official said.     such services make communications between otherwise incompatible computers possible over telecommunications lines.     the official said firms registering as "special type two telecommunications firms," which are those leasing lines from common carriers, will be permitted to re-lease the lines to users and provide international services.     steps will also be taken to assure fairness in negotiations between common carriers and firms seeking to lease lines, the official said.     since december, 10 companies have registered as special type two firms, including two which have american telephone and telegraph co <t> or mcdonnell douglas corp <md> as major shareholders, the official said.     currently only <kokusai denshin denwa co ltd> and <nippon telegraph and telephone corp> are allowed to operate international telecommunications services.  reuter &#3;</h3>
