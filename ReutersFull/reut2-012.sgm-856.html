	<h3><noranda inc> said a copper mine fire that killed one miner and trapped 44 others for nearly a day caused an estimated 10 mln canadian dlrs in damage.     the fire, which started wednesday and burned for more than 24 hours, destroyed the mine's three-year-old conveyor system, officials said.     michel lefebvre, vice president of operations, said noranda will operate the mine at about one third of its normal 72,000 short ton annual finished capacity, using above ground reserves, until it decides whether to keep the mine open.     "the events we sustained yesterday and the day before are a very serious setback for gaspe mines operations," lefebvre said. gaspe mines is the name of the noranda division that operates the murdochville mine.     he said it would take four or five months to bring operations up to full capacity if the company decides to do so, adding that he believes there is a good chance noranda will fully reopen the mine.  reuter &#3;</h3>
