	<h3>china's foreign debt is very low given its export capability, the size of its economy and its growth potential and the country is politically stable, jean-maxime leveque, chairman of credit lyonnais, told reporters.     leveque, who has met the heads of most of china's banks including the president of its central bank during a visit here, said the chinese authorities are very attentive to its foreign debt and have the matter under control.     official figures show china's foreign debt at a post-1949 record 16 billion dlrs at end-1986.     asked if he had advised china to borrow more francs and u.s. dollars and less yen, leveque said he had not offered any advice, but added: "the yen and the dollar are not stable, but the ecu is stable."     asked if his bank has lost any confidence in china after the resignation of communist party chief hu yaobang in january, he said: "we have total confidence in the political stability in china. the policies of the open door and economic development outlined in 1979 will not change, although there may be fluctuations in speed."  reuter &#3;</h3>
