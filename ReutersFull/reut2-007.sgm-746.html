	<h3>audio/video affiliates inc said it has filed suit against <dixons group plc>, cyclops corp, alleghany corp <y> and others in connection with dixons' recently completed tender offer in which it raised its ownership of cyclops to 56 pct.     the company said the suit, filed in u.s. district court for the southern district of ohio, seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction requiring dixons, for 10 business days, to permit any cyclops shareholder who previously tendered and now wishes to withdraw to do so.     the company said the order and injunction would also prohibit dixons from exercising a "lockup" option granted it by cyclops and prohibit dixons for 10 business days from attempting to exercise any control over cyclops.     audio/video said the suit also requests the court to order cyclops to immediately provide to all potential bidders for cyclops all information given to dixons.     audio/video and citicorp <cci> have been tendering for all cyclops shares in a competing offer at 80.00 dlrs per share but said it could raise its bid to 92.50 dlrs under certain circumstances.  dixons offered 90.25 dlrs in its tender.     in february alleghany agreed to buy cyclops' steel and nonresidential construction business for 111.6 mln dlrs in cash and the assumption of liabilities.  reuter &#3;</h3>
