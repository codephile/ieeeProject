	<h3>central bank president francisco gros said possible retaliation by brazil's creditors would not be an intelligent measure because it would affect both sides.     "if our creditors considered retaliation, brazil would lose its capacity to export, thus would never be able to pay its debt," gros said in a news conference.     gros said that during their 12-day globe-trotting tour of several countries, he and finance minister dilson funaro warned creditors that brazil could no longer continue representing the role of merely an exporter of capital.     "we made it very clear to our creditors that we must find other means to pay our debt. we told them we wish to pay but that first we must make sure that the country grows," gros said.     "we pointed out to them that in the last two years brazil paid 24 billion dlrs just in interest rates, while only receiving two billion dlrs in new loans over a similar period." gros reiterated that brazil will not accept interference from the international monetary fund (imf), as creditors suggested.     "the performance of the imf over the years has not been convenient to our needs. it is an important institution, but we do not accept it to monitor our economy," he said.     "the banks would welcome us going to the imf. we would welcome if they pardoned half our debt," gros said.     brazil announced suspension of interest payment of 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial foreign banks on february 20. no deadline was established for the renewal of the payment.     "our major commitment is with the country's growth. therefore, we need more money to invest on new projects," gros said.  he said that before the announcement of the suspension of interest payment, brazil was paying about 500 mln dlrs a month to its commercial foreign creditors.     "we can say that at least we are saving some money," he said.     gros said brazil has not submitted specific proposals to creditors, and instead hopes that proposals would come through bilateral negotiations.     the central bank president said he will be going next week to washington to take part in a meeting of the inter american development bank .     in brasilia, sources linked to the presidency said brazil was preparing a new program of economic readjustment to strengthen its negotiations on its 109 billion dlr foreign debt. the sources said the new program could be announced by the end of the month and calls basically for preservation of the country's growth.                 reuter &#3;</h3>
