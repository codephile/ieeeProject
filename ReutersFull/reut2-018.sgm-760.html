	<h3>the european parliament threatened to block european community spending plans for next year and implied it could also hold up attempts to solve an ever-deepening budget crisis this year.     the parliament voted unanimously in favour of a resolution condemning the annual haggling and compromising between the community's 12 member states on spending levels.     "it is no longer possible to resort to short-term measures or to provisional budgetary solutions. it is no longer possible to accept a budget in which real expenditure is not covered by revenue," the resolution said.     parliamentary blocking could jeopardise efforts to solve a financing crisis over a five billion european currency unit (ecu) shortfall for this year, diplomats said. ec ministers are deadlocked on the issue.     it also would plunge the ec into an ever-deepening crisis next year. without parliamentary approval of the 1988 budget, the community would be forced into emergency measures, with spending set according to the previous year's levels.     british conservative parliamentarian peter price told reporters that parliament could delay an emergency package until ec ministers prove they are ready to find a long-term solution.  reuter &#3;</h3>
