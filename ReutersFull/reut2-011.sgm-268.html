	<h3>ivory coast maize output has risen steadily during the last two decades and the country aims to produce two mln tonnes annually "very rapidly," the official daily fraternite matin reported.     it said the country reached self-sufficiency in maize three years ago and harvested a record 530,000 tonnes in 1985 compared with only 200,000 tonnes 20 years earlier.     the daily did not detail 1986 output but said further production increases are anticipated in the years ahead as part of a policy of boosting domestic output to cut grain imports.  reuter &#3;</h3>
