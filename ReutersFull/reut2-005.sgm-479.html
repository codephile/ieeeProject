	<h3>the governor of the bank of england, robin leigh-pemberton, repeated his criticism of city predators, describing them as "thoroughly irresponsible."     "i have been concerned when predators have sought to use a minority shareholding to unsettle a perfectly well-managed company and to create an atmosphere in which a bid becomes daily expected," he said in a speech to the industrial society.     "such activity can amount to a thoroughly irresponsible exercise of shareholder power, and an abuse of the arrangements we have for the protection of shareholders' interests," he said.     leigh-pemberton was resuming a theme he developed in a speech last week, when he attacked the practice of "putting a company into play."     this is when predators use a minority shareholding to force a company's management into action which will raise the company's share price. the predator then withdraws, taking substantial profits.     in today's speech, leigh-pemberton said it was hard to find the right tightrope to walk between intervention and adherence to a free market philosophy.  reuter &#3;</h3>
