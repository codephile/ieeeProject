	<h3>den danske bank af 1871 a/s said it was issuing the first certificates of deposit from a danish bank and that the cds will be for six, nine and 12 months or a negotiable period.     they will come in denominations of 10 mln crowns without commission to the bank. interest will be linked to money and capital market rates and paid on a discount basis, with certificates sold below par and maturing at par, a bank statement said.     the certificates are not liable to stamp duty. "they will be a flexible supplement to negotiated deposits and will give companies and institutional investors better chances to organise liquidity," the statement said.     bank spokesman arne lund said "we could not do it earlier because it was not possible for the tax authorities to say if the certificates were liable to stamp duty or not."     he said the issue should be assisted by high short-term interest rates.  reuter &#3;</h3>
