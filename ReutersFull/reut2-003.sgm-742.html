"good domestic demand, higher operating earnings and a strng export business, probably benefitting from a lower dollar and effects of reduced imports in chemicals will continue to aid du pont." he also noted that energy earnings in the first quarter are better than expected because of the rise in crude prices. semegran expects first quarter earnings of about 1.85 dlrs a share from 1.67 dlrs last year.     he also expects the company to raise its annual dividend about 20 to 30 cts a share, from its current dividend of 3.20 dlrs a share, "and a stock split is possible but it has a low probablility."  reuter &#3;</h3>
