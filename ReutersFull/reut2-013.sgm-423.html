	<h3>the australian dollar staged a strong recovery on the local market after sharp overnight falls offshore, as a weak u.s. dollar and capital inflow into local gold stocks and securities boosted demand, dealers said.     the dollar closed at 0.7092/97 u.s. dlrs, after opening easier at 0.7040/45 from u.s. lows of 0.7030/40. but the dollar still had not recovered to yesterday's local closing levels of 0.7109/14.     traders are confident the local unit will return above 0.7100, and they regard today's fall as a correction in the currency's recent uptrend.     traders said the australian dollar, after trading around 0.7040/50 for most of the day, surged to its day's high in late afternoon trading on asian buying.     they said offshore traders are still bullish towards the australian dollar as yesterday's u.s. selling occurred in thin volume.     nervousness over the short-term direction of the u.s. dollar ahead of the international monetary fund meeting also provided support for the australian dollar. in asia, the u.s. dollar ended lower at 145.15/20 yen against tokyo's 145.25 close and new york's final 145.85/90.     the u.s. dollar also finished at 1.8208/18 marks against tokyo's 1.8205/15 and 1.8260/70 in new york.     the reserve bank trade weighted index eased to 55.7 points from yesterday's 56.0. the u.s. dollar average hedge settlement rate was struck at 70.66 from 71.10.  reuter &#3;</h3>
