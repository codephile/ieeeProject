	<h3>yugoslavia has signed up for a 550 mln ecu loan from the european community (ec), the  official tanjug news agency said.     it said the agreement, which has yet to be ratified by the 12 ec countries and the european parliament, was signed last night in brussels.     the 20 year, 7.5 pct interest loan will be used to complete the trans-yugoslavia motorway and modernise the country's railway network, the agency said.     yugoslavia's request for a 100 mln ecu grant was refused by the ec, but will be discussed again, tanjug added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
