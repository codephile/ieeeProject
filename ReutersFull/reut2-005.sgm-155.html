	<h3>brazilian bank workers voted to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour unrest arising from the failure of the government's anti-inflation plan.     at a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of sao paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on march 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.     wilson gomes de moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, told reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks.     the vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company petrobras.     the government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the troops were removed yesterday.     petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their willingess to negotiate next wednesday. the government has also sent marines into the main ports.     a spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in rio de janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise.     seamen employed by two small companies have already accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about 5,000 seamen employed by petrobras.     last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high interest rates charged by banks.     according to official estimates, prices rose by more than 33 pct in the first two months of this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
