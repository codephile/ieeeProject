	<h3>a south african trade union is in dispute with a subsidiary of britain's johnson matthey plc over the company's proposal to move a platinum refinery near johannesburg to a black tribal homeland.     the 30,000-member mainly black chemical workers industrial union said it fears the planned move to the bophuthatswana homeland, where south african unions are not recognised, could lead to job losses and affect wages.     a mass dismissal last year at the impala platinum holdings ltd <ipla.j> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinum prices rocketing.      the union said talks with management over the proposed move had broken down. it said an earlier ballot of refinery workers showed that most favoured striking over the move but added that no final decision had been taken on strike action.     the refinery processes all platinum metals of rustenburg platinum holdings ltd, the world's largest platinum producer.     it is owned by matthey rustenburg ltd, a joint-subsidiary of johnson matthey and rustenburg which, in turn, is owned by mining group johannesburg consolidated investment co ltd.  reuter &#3;</h3>
