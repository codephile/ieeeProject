	<h3>cotton futures were steady this morning on commission house buying. but trade selling was keeping gains to a minimum, brokers said.     there was no news, but brokers said the market is  technically weak and in search of a bottom. recent news of poor export sales remained a damper, brokers said.     cotton for may delivery was up 0.25 cent at 56.05 cents a lb in a 56.30 to 55.80 cent range.     december delivery was up 0.40 cent at 55.15 cents.  reuter &#3;</h3>
