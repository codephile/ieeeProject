	<h3>cominco ltd said it will permanently close its fertilizer plant at kimberley, british columbia, in the latter half of may and 140 employees will lose their jobs.     it said the operation has been losing money for several years, and lost seven mln dlrs in 1986.     cominco said the decision to close the plant was based on high production costs, anticipated continued losses and excess capacity for phosphate-based fertilizers. the plant produced 98,500 metric tonnes of ammonium phosphate fertilizer and 190,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid in 1986.                                             reuter &#3;</h3>
