	<h3>italy's barley crop is generally in good condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the agricultural marketing information and research board irvam said.     first consignments were expected to be available around mid-june.     excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in sardinia, which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop because of extreme dryness.     irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.     given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national production would be around two pct higher than in the previous season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.     if yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
