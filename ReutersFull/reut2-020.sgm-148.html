	<h3>the white house took a wait-and-see attitude toward the stock market crisis, barring "precipitous action" to deal with it.     referring to news reports, white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said, "it seems most of the world economists are uncertain as to the specific causes, so we'll just have to wait and see if there's a rebound today."     "we certainly don't want to take precipitous action," the spokesman added.     "no meetings are scheduled at this time. we'll monitor the situation and see how the markets respond today," he said.      reuter &#3;</h3>
