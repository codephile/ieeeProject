	<h3>opec president rilwanu lukman accused "oil market manipulators" of drawing down their own stocks and spreading rumours to give the impression opec was breaking its 15.8 mln barrels per day output ceiling, set last december.     lukman told reporters the aim was to pull prices below the 18 dlrs per barrel reference level set by opec.     "people are playing a waiting game to test the will of opec by drawing down more on their stock than normal, and this is having the effect of giving an apparent excess supply on the market which we know is not real," lukman said.     lukman, nigeria's oil minister, said that despite probable "minor deviations" by one or two member countries, "basically opec is producing around what it said it would produce."     after opec's price and production accord last december, the market firmed steadily but spot prices fell in the last week to around 16 dlrs. industry reports estimated the organization was producing up to one mln bpd above its ceiling during february.     but lukman was confident opec would maintain its discipline, in view of past experience. "we have the experience of what happened in 1986 behind us, when violations of agreements led to the collapse of the market," he said.     lukman was in kingston as a guest of the state-owned petroleum corp of jamaica.  reuter &#3;</h3>
