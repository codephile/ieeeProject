	<h3>u.s. agriculture department proposals to offer 260,000 tonnes of subsidized vegetable oil to four countries are still under consideration by an interagency trade policy group, a usda official close to the group said.     the official, who asked not to be identified, dismissed a report circulating in markets today that the interagency trade policy review group had rejected the proposals.     under the proposals, usda would offer vegetable oil under the export enhancement program, eep, to four countries, including 80,000 tonnes to turkey and 60,000 tonnes to algeria, morocco and tunisia, industry sources said.     the proposals "are still under review" by the interagency working group, the usda official said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
