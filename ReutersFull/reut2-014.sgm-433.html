	<h3>new immigration rules relating to alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the u.s. agriculture department are meeting with objections in congress, sources on capitol hill said.     usda is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable commodities.     the department is considering including in its definition of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops, spanish reeds and christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane, the new york times reported yesterday.     rep. howard berman, d-calif., would like to see the definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which is "a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation," gene smith, a spokesman for berman, said.     livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying usda hard to have their products covered by the amnesty provision, farm industry sources said.     chuck fields of the american farm bureau federation said livestock producers were "desperate" because they fear they will be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined that industry.     a house staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986 immigration law who asked not to be identified said congress did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and spanish reeds was "marginal."     in addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of christmas trees "a tough call," this source said.     usda officials declined to comment on the draft regulation except to say it was subject to change before it will be released, probably some time later this month.     while lawmakers may object to the usda rule under consideration relating to perishable commodities, congress is not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration question, congressional sources said.     the amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.     congressional staff members estimate the special farm worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to 350,000 aliens. the law would allow eligible farm workers who worked for 90 days during the year ending may 1, 1986, to apply for temporary, then permanent, resident status.  reuter &#3;</h3>
