	<h3>french finance minister edouard balladur discussed the need to control public spending in talks here today with british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson, a treasury spokesman said.     the spokesman said the ministers reviewed their economies, and public spending, domestic and european community-wide.     he declined to comment on whether the subject of concerted action to shore up the dollar had arisen. the u.s. currency dipped sharply earlier this week after a month of relative stability after an agreement by six major industrialised nations in paris on february 22 to stabilise their currencies. reuter &#3;</h3>
