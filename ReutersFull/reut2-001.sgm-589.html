	<h3>sen. rudy boschwitz, r-minn., said he intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they planted.     boschwitz told the senate agriculture committee that applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.     the minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the senate floor or in a conference committee with the house of representatives in the event a similar bill before the house agriculture committee is approved by that body.     boschwitz told reuters that neither he nor the u.s. agriculture department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme.     if payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments.     senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy, d-vt., said he wanted to go to conference with the house as soon as possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter further before deciding how he would vote on it.  reuter &#3;</h3>
