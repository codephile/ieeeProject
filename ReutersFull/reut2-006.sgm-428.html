	<h3>the european community executive commission today announced plans to open up government contracts to companies throughout the 12-country bloc.     internal market commissioner lord cockfield told a news conference the commission will shortly make proposals to open up contracts awarded by state-owned utilities such as telecommunications, transport, energy and water.     about 400 billion european currency units worth of contracts are awarded by governments and public bodies in the ec every year. the commission says only 20 pct of these are open to competition from outside the country.  reuter &#3;</h3>
