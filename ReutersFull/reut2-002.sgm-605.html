	<h3>the failure of international coffee organization talks on the reintroduction of quotas has paralysed business on the hamburg green coffee market in the past week, trade sources said.     there was only sporadic activity for spot material, which was mainly requirement buying, they said, adding that pre-registered coffees were no longer available.     they said they expected brazil and colombia to open export registrations for may shipment next week. however, the president of the brazilian coffee institute, jorio dauster, said yesterday he had not yet decided when its registrations would reopen.  reuter &#3;</h3>
