	<h3>the united auto workers confirmed an earlier company statement that contract talks between striking workers at a general motors corp's michigan plant and the union will resume at 1000 est tomorrow.     a uaw spokesman, in confirming a gm statement that talks will restart, said it "remains to be seen whether the talks will be successful."     the union, in a statement, said it was unable to reach a comprehensive settlement with gm on the issue of the company's subcontracting work to non-union labor, although tentative agreement was reached "on many matters." a uaw spokesman would not discuss the issues involved.     the union's 9,000 workers walked off the job at gm's pontiac, mich., truck and bus works earlier today.  reuter &#3;</h3>
