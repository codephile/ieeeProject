	<h3>poland's communist government raised food, fuel and energy prices but said it had taken an economic risk by reducing the scale of the increases under pressure from the country's official trade unions.     a communique broadcast on saturday evening said food prices would rise on average by 9.3 pct, petrol, gas and electricity by 25 pct and coal by 50 pct.     the immediate increases will be followed by a rise of 10 pct in the cost of meat from april 1. some postal charges will go up 100 pct next month and rail and bus fares by 30 pct in october.     the government said its annual plan for the economy had specified a 13 pct increase in food prices this year.     "economic reasoning calls for greater price rises than those which have been announced ... the government has taken an economic risk in accepting a portion of the trades unions' demands," the communique said.     the national trade union alliance (opzz), which claims seven million members, warned earlier this month it would fight efforts to impose the original range of price rises. it said the rises would badly affect the lower paid and the old, despite government pledges to protect their purchasing power.     solidarity leader lech walesa, whose banned organisation has been replaced by the opzz, condemned the increases in front of a crowd of 1,500 cheering supporters at st brygida's roman catholic church in the baltic port of gdansk.     "for the first time in six years (since solidarity was banned), i say enough. for the first time, i am decidedly against. i am against price rises as being the only sign of reform," walesa said.     "i am for reforms. i favour the reforms which (soviet leader mikhail) gorbachev is carrying out  ... but i am not in favour of make-believe reforms," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
