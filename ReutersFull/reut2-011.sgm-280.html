	<h3>south korean finance minister chung in-yong will resist pressure for a currency revaluation to cut south korea's trade surplus with the united states when he meets treasury secretary james baker next week, finance ministry officials said.     they said chung would leave monday to attend the international monetary fund's interim committee meeting and to hold talks with baker and other u.s. officials on ways to reduce the surplus.     the april 9 committee meeting is expected to review the agreement by six industrialized nations in paris last month that newly-industrialized countries, such as south korea and taiwan, should allow their currencies to increase in value.  reuter &#3;</h3>
