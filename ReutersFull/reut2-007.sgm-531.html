	<h3>west german president richard von weizsaecker called on creditor banks to ease pressure on argentina's foreign debt repayment terms.     "we cannot remain indifferent to the pressure of creditor banks, since there is correlation between political stability and the economic situation," weizsaecker told reporters.     argentina said last month it would suspend debt payments if creditor banks did not loosen repayment terms and grant a new 2.15 billion dlr loan.     argentina's debt is latin america's third largest at 51 billion dlrs.     weizsaecker, on a four-day official visit to argentina, said: "argentina's problems require joint action from creditor and debtors countries," and not prepared recipes from creditor banks.     a group of ecologists staged a demonstration to protest argentina's plans to build a fourth nuclear power plant and a german company's role in the project as a contractor.     earlier, weizsaecker said that the potential of patagonia, the barren tableland covering a third of argentina, could assure the economic future of the country.  reuter &#3;</h3>
