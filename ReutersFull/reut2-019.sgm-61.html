	<h3>japan must try harder to reduce its trade surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure, economic planning minister tetsuo kondo.     he told a press luncheon he hoped japan could cut its current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs. in the fiscal year ended march 31 the surplus totalled 93.76 billion dlrs, or about 4.5 pct of gnp.     the 6,000 billion yen economic stimulation package the government unveiled late last month would help slash japan's current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
