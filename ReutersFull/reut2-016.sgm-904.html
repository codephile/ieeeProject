	<h3>gulf and western inc <gw> said it believes it has no liability under an earlier reported lawsuit seeking 500 mln dlrs in damages against it and two other companies.     the suit, filed by niagara mohawk power corp and other owners of the nine mile point two nuclear plant, concerns the design and fabrication of the ball valve system for the facility.     "niagara mohawk appears to be trying to shift their responsibilities in connection with the construction of the nine mile point two plant to others," gulf and western said.     gulf and western said it has not yet seen the lawsuit.     the company said a subsidiary no longer owned by it sold the valves in question in 1977. since then, the valves have been subject to substantial modifications by others, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
