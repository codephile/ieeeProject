	<h3>indonesia's foreign debts are a cause for concern, but remain within manageable limits, world bank president barber conable said.     he told a press conference before leaving for tokyo that indonesia's rising debt-service ratio was a problem and cause for concern. but he said it was not necessarily due to imprudent borrowing and "it is still within an area of being manageable."     the bank estimates indonesia has total foreign debts of around 37 billion dlrs. the debt service ratio has risen to a projected 33 pct for fiscal 1987/88, from 25 pct in 1986/87 ending march 31.     anything above 20 pct is considered high by bankers.     conable said the decline in world oil prices and the rise in the value of the japanese yen had increased the ratio by reducing indonesian exports and raising its debt repayments.     indonesian debt servicing of 6,760 billion rupiah takes up almost one third of the 1987/88 budget.     payment on the principal of government debts is officially projected at 2.73 billion dlrs in 1987/88 against 2.11 billion in 1986/87.     conable linked an increase in world bank lending to indonesia to implementation of further economic policy reforms.  reuter &#3;</h3>
