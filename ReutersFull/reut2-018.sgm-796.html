	<h3>the world bank said it has loaned mexico 400 mln dlrs to help support an agricultural credit project.     the project hopes to increase agricultural productivity, exports, and real farm income by providing credit to private farmers, ranchers and agro-industries, the bank said.     the loan will be used for lending mainly by commercial banks and the national rural credit bank, mexico's largest agricultural credit lender, the bank said.     it also said the project hopes to aid in reducing the government's interest rate and credit subsidies.     the project will also support improvement of the agricultural credit system through reduction of subsidies for credit and crop insurance, and increased domestic resource mobilization, the bank said.     the loan, guaranteed by the government, is for 15 years, including three years of grace, at a variable interest rate - currently 7.92 pct, the bank said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
