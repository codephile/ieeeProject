	<h3>the stock exchange is virtually certain to agree to change its regulations in order to permit "when issued" trading of u.k. government bonds (gilts) as part of an experimental series of bond auctions later this year, market sources said.     "the principle that this "when issued' trading should take place has been accepted by the executive committee of the international stock exchange," said george nissen, chairman of the gilt edged market makers' association (gemma). "it's a question of how, rather than whether," he told reuters.     the bank of england announced in february that it planned a possible series of experimental auctions for gilts, similar to the system used to market u.s. treasury issues, with the first auction possibly in april or may.      the bank said at that stage that it was not opposed in principle to "when issued" trading developing in bonds in the period between the announcement of full details of the auction and the auction itself, as in the u.s.     however, "when issued" trading is prohibited under the rules of the international stock exchange, formerly the london stock exchange, and would require an amendment in order to proceed.     nissen said discussions on the technical details of a rule change to allow "when issued" trading were still taking place between the government broker at the bank of england and the quotations department of the stock exchange.     the 27 gilt-edged primary dealers regard the introduction of grey market trading as an essential feature of an auction system covering part of the government's funding needs.     "if we are going into an auction system, we need to have some form of market test of the stock we're bidding for," said simon hartnell, head trader at primary dealer alexanders laing and cruickshank gilts ltd.     "the american wi (when issued) market certainly functions very efficiently," he said.     nissen said he believed that if "when issued" trading were not allowed, market-makers "would be extremely unhappy about the whole auction."     gilt dealers noted that it was a basic provision of stock exchange rules that dealing could not take place in a stock until it was listed by the quotations department. however, this was mainly designed to prevent a grey market springing up in equities prior to listing.     they pointed out that in contrast to the many uncertainties connected with an issue of equity securities, there would be few imponderables relating to bonds just about to be issued by the bank of england.     senior market sources noted that in any case "when issued" trading would be supervised by the stock exchange and would be subject to bank of england supervisory guidelines.     since the bank of england and market-makers themselves are known to be in favour of the idea, the sources said, there was now a presumption that there would be scope for "when issued" trading to take place.     gilt sales now are effected by means of large-scale stock tenders or by tap issues of stock tranches direct to the market. but greater market capitalisation following the "big bang" restructuring last year provided an opportunity for change.     a combination of both systems would enable the bank to benefit from both the flexibility offered by traditional marketing methods and the guarantee of a steady supply of funds implied by auctions.     the bank said in a consultative document published in february that possibly two or three experimental auctions might each raise between one to 1-1/2 billion stg.     the remainder of the funding would be conducted by traditional tender and tap issue means. total gross official sales of gilt-edged stock were 11.9 billion stg in 1985/86.     nissen said that market-makers had agreed unanimously with the bank's view that auctions would be more easily conducted on a price basis, rather than based on yield.     he said that the odds were also in favour of adoption of a bid price form of auction, where successful bidders were allotted stock at the various prices at which they bid, rather than a common price allotment whereby stock was allocated at the lowest accepted price.     hartnell said that while a "when issued" facility was crucial to market-makers' adaptation to the new system, he would also have liked to see an extension to the "fallow" period proposal made by the bank of england.     the bank said that it would not sell by any method stock of the same type as that to be auctioned between the time of the announcement of auction details and a period ending 28 days after the auction itself.     noting that in the case of long bond auctions, u.s. primary dealers have as much as three months between successive sales of stock, hartnell said the bank's proposal was "very tight."     nissen said that following a meeting between gemma and the bank of england on march 3, which he described as "very helpful," gemma submitted a note making several further residual points.     market-makers are now awaiting a further, fairly definitive, paper from the bank which would contain details of auction procedures. although the bank has not yet formally announced a definite intention to proceed with the auctions, most market participants assume that they will go ahead.     "my own view is that we are on course and the first indications from the original paper - an auction at the end of april or in may - must be the best assumption," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
