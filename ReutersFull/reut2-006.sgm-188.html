	<h3>the surinam aluminum company (suralco) registered a 75 pct drop in alumina exports in february after its operations were shut down by worker violence and guerrilla sabotage, the official surinam news agency, sna, reported.     sna said suralco's alumina exports dropped to 23,869 tonnes in february from 92,852 tonnes in january. aluminum exports, meanwhile, decreased nine pct in the same period, to 1,511 tonnes from 1,647 tonnes.     suralco's alumina refinery at paranam, 18 miles south of the capital, was shut down february 2 after workers destroyed plant and computer equipment in a protest over layoffs at the company's nearby aluminum smelter.     the smelter was shut down january 26 after anti-government guerrillas dynamited two electricity towers which transmit power to the plant from the afobaka dam.     the alumina refinery, owned jointly by suralco and billiton nv, a royal dutch shell subsidiary, was reopened march 9. but the smelter remains closed, as do the suralco mines at moengo, 60 miles east of paramaribo, which were closed down by guerrillas last november.  reuter &#3;</h3>
