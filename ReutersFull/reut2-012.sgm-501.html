	<h3>mauritius has lifted import duties on textiles and other goods connected with the textile industry as part of its economic liberalisation programme, finance minister vishnu lutchmeenaraido said.     lutchmeenaraido said the move was aimed at boosting the local textiles industry and making this indian ocean island a shopping paradise for textile goods. he said all types of textiles, textile machinery and associated goods such as sewing thread, buttons and collar supports would be placed on the duty-free list, effective from april 1.     official sources said the government was also planning to abolish import duties on fertiliser and agricultural equipment, with the liberalisation measures would be extended to other areas of industry later.     the textiles industry dominates mauritius's export processing zone, and the island has become a major exporter of woollen knitwear.  reuter &#3;</h3>
