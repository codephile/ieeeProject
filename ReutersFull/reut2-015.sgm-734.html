	<h3>beirut radio stations said israeli helicopter gunships raided south lebanon and that one of the craft was downed.     state owned beirut radio quoted witnesses as saying one helicopter was apparently shot down by heavy anti-aircraft fire as it attacked targets in the ain al-hilweh area east of the port of sidon.     the sunni moslem voice of the homeland radio said the helicopter was seen falling into the sea.     there was no immediate independent confirmation of the reports.  reuter &#3;</h3>
