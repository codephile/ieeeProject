	<h3>unisys corp vice chairman joseph kroger said the company's new series 1100 mainframe computer products will not be available for at least a year.     at a press conference introducing new products in the v500 computer series, kroger said unisys's new super 90 and mercury computers will not be available until after march 1988. the products are being developed for addition to the 1100 series.     no specific time frame had been set for introduction of the super 90, which will be based on the existing 1190 mainframe, or the mercury, which will be a new computer, a unisys spokesman said.     "there is a lot of pent-up customer demand for the products," kroger told reuters. but unisys has not lost any customers currently using its 1190 mainframes because of the wait for the new products, he said.     at the press conference, kroger said unisys is not developing a one-megabit computer memory chip but will probably buy them when appropriate from japanese suppliers.     in response to a question, kroger indicated first quarter orders should be up from a year ago, with international business good and the u.s. market still "difficult."  reuter &#3;</h3>
