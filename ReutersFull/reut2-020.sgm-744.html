	<h3>the securities and exchange commission said it made a one-day exception to its rule of prohibiting companies from repurchasing their own stock in the last half hour of trading, and allowed firms to continue stock repurchases until the close of market.     an sec spokesperson told reuters that the rule exception only covered repurchases made today.     analysts said that widespread stock repurchases by many firms today were a contributing factor in the market's rebound from yesterday's huge losses.     the rule prohibiting repurchases in the final half-hour of trading works to prevent rapid end-of-day stock price rises which could be caused by a company's open-market purchase of its own stock at the end of a trading session, the spokesperson said.     share repurchases today were called "a smart way to use corporate equity," by one sec staff member who refused to be identified.  reuter &#3;</h3>
