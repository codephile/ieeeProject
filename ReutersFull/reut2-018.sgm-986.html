	<h3>france's growth rate is expected to strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half, but unemployment will worsen, the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) said.     in its semi-annual review of the world economy, the oecd forecast that growth in the french gross domestic product (gdp) would run at about two pct in the next six months. it said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly higher than in the first half of this year.     the oecd said france's economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987.      activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated, the oecd said. unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.     the report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year. but both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.     the oecd forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six months. the slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
