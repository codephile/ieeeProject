	<h3>a new rabobank mortgage bond, whose terms dealers considered extremely generous, was in heavy demand on the amsterdam bourse today, bond dealers said.     rabobank, not anticipating a strong two-day rally in dutch bonds, on wednesday set an issue price of 99.50 pct for a 6.25 pct eight-year open mortgage bond, giving it a yield about 1/4 pct higher than the market average.     rabobank stopped trading in the bond five minutes after the bourse opened, but already between 200 and 300 mln guilders worth had been sold, a rabobank spokesman said. one japanese investor took 50 mln guilders alone, a dealer said.     later, the bank proposed to allot only 30 pct of subscriptions, causing a general outcry among traders. rabobank finally gave in to bourse demands to honour all subscriptions.     "we simply did not expect prices to rise so much," a rabobank spokesman said." since the pricing, the bond price index has risen 0.9 to 117.3, and the average state loan yield has fallen accordingly to 6.04 pct.     two weeks ago, rabobank issued a 250 mln guilder 6.75 pct bond at par, giving it a yield 0.40 above the average bank loan yields that day of 6.35 pct. the issue was heavily over-subscribed.  reuter &#3;</h3>
