	<h3>congressional ire is rising against the multinational development banks which make loans to help other countries produce goods in direct competition with beleagured u.s. farmers and miners.     with a record u.s. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year and a farm economy in the doldrums, congress is pressing to hold back u.s. funds for the world bank and other development banks if the money is used to subsidize production or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.      "american tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct competition with our producers," senator don nickles, an oklahoma republican, said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans.     nickles and senator steven symms, a conservative republican from idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly limit u.s. funding of multinational development banks if they make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus commodities or minerals.     current law requires that the united states vote against such loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately approved by the banks.     treasury secretary james baker's assurances that u.s. policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised at two senate committee hearings last week.     baker told a senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, "as a policy matter, we oppose loans for production of commodities in oversupply."     the senators cited a 350-mln-dlr world bank loan made to argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.     nickles, symms and others also have cited other loans such as a 1985 world bank loan to hungary to expand livestock exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to thailand from 1981 to 1985 at low interest rates for agriculture.     last year the republican-controlled senate voted three times over the objections of the administration to cut u.s. funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.     but even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal, the restrictions were weakened in the final version. only a provision directing u.s. officials to vote disapproval cleared congress.     this year's version, called the foreign agricultural investment reform (fair) act would require the u.s. to vote against loans designed to increase production of surplus commodities and minerals. also, the recipient countries would have to prove that the production, marketing and export of the commodities could be handled without government subsidy.     if the loan is approved over u.s. objections, the united states would not increase or replenish funds for that institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.     objections to such loans have most often been raised by conservative republicans who have traditionally opposed u.s. funding for these international development banks.     but the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised similar concerns among more moderate senators.     the administration opposes any legislation that would tie its hands in votes on the loans. it argues there might be instances in which a country needed the money to continue its moves toward u.s. policies in other areas.     baker said the united states would continue to use its leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.     two house republicans, representatives larry craig of idaho and beau bolter of texas, have introduced the bill. but it faces stiff opposition in the house banking committee which has blocked its consideration by the house in the past.     symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any related legislation this year, an aide said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
