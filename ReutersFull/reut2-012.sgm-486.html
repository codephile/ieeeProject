	<h3>international technology corp said it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter ended march 31 of about 20 cts per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of 11 cts.     the company blamed the expected loss on regulatory and permitting issues that limited the full utilization of hazardous waste treatment cites in califoirnia, continued startup delays for major remediation projects, the writeoff of an investment in a subsidiary and a settlem,ent with the california attorney general's office and department of health services.     the company said the settlement relates to regulatory violations alleged by the u.s. environmental protection agengy and the california health services department at the company's vine hill and panoche treatment facilities in northern california.     it said under the agreement, it will pay the state 2,100,000 dlrs in civil penalties over a two-year period and pay 500,000 dlrs over five years to local medical facilities as part of a community awareness and emergency response program developed by local communities.  the expenses will be charged against fourth quarter results, it said.     the company said it has agreed as well to make compliance and public safety capital expenditures of about 600,000 dlrs.     it said it has now received an operating permit for a new 250,000 cubic yard landfill cell at its imperial county, calif., from the health services department.     the company said the panoche facility remains closed but is expected to reopen for liquid and sludge receipts in the near future.  but it said receipts of solid material, which had accounted for the majority of the revenue at the site, could be restricted until 1988 pending resolution of capacity issues in the panoche site permit.  reuter &#3;</h3>
