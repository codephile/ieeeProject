	<h3>rising service payments on kenya's three billion dlr external debt will absorb nearly all the 1.1 billion dlrs of foreign aid likely over the next four years, president daniel arap moi said.     "while we expect to receive 18.3 billion kenyan shillings in the form of external loans for our development programs in the next four years, we will be repaying more than 13.5 billion... by way of external debt servicing...," moi told a conference of american businessmen in nairobi.     the president added that if developing countries continue to experience foreign exchange outflows on this scale, many will be unable to sustain a level of imports necessary to ensure economic growth. he called on the international community to ensure a real transfer of resources from the industrialised to the developing countries.     moi said kenya had so far met all obligations regarding its foreign debt, which his government has never tried to reschedule.  reuter &#3;</h3>
