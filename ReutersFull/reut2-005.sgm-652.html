	<h3>the business journal of new jersey said it will publish garden state home and garden monthly, beginning in september.     the company said the publication was launched as a bi-monthly in november 1986. the decision to covert to a monthly was made as a result of increasing demand for advertising space in the first four issues.     the company also said it expects 1987 revenues of about three mln dlrs, continuing average growth of over 50 pct for a second year.     a spokesman declined to release actual 1986, stating the company had not completed its 10k report. for the first nine months of 1986, it had sales of 1,070,000 dlrs while sales for all of 1985 were a little less than one mln dlrs, he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
