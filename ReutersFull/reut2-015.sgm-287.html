	<h3>the group of 24 developing countries said in a communique that some kind of debt relief is necessary and called for "a new attitude" on the part of the banks.     the communique, released in conjunction with the semiannual meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank, said the very low income countries needed a cancellation of debt to industrial countries, a conversion of part of their debt into grants and a rescheduling on concessional terms.     for some other countries, the communique said, the debt cannot be properly serviced if the countries are to grow at the same time.     "the debt overhang effects the capacity to grow as it reduces the ability to import," the communique said.     it added: "some kind of debt relief and a new attitude on the part of the banks is necessary."     the communique added that debtor countries and banks have to explore new market mechanisms, debt into equity swaps, capitalization of interest and writeoffs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
