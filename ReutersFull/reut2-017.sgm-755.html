	<h3>federal deposit insurance corporation chairman l. william seidman told a bankers' meeting he thinks more banks will follow citicorp and chase manhattan in building up their reserves to meet latin american debt problems.     seidman, speaking to an american bankers association trade conference, said he did not think regulators would play as big a role in encouraging banks to build up their loan-loss reserves as the marketplace.     "my guess is that we as regulators won't become the key factor. i think the market system will get most of the other banks to follow suit," seidman said.     in the past two weeks, citicorp added three billion dlrs and chase manhattan 1.6 billion to loan-loss reserves.  reuter &#3;</h3>
