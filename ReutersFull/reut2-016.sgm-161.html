	<h3>gold bullion continued to move higher supported by good general buying and was fixed this morning at 436.50 dlrs, 268.368 stg, an ounce, up from friday's close of 432.00/50, dealers said.     the setting was the highest since october 8 as gold built on friday's gains, which had been based on the weakness of the dollar and fears of a trade war between the united states and japan.     it opened slightly firmer at 433.50/434.00 and moved up steadily during the morning supported by commission house and trade buying, dealers said.     dealers said there was resistance around 440.00 but with sentiment still firm some traders believe the rally may even take gold as high as 500 dlrs.     platinum was fixed this morning at 583.50 dlrs an ounce, up from friday's close of 578.50/580.50, and also the highest setting since october.  reuter &#3;</h3>
