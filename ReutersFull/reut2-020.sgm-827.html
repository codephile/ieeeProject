	<h3>the u.s. senate on tuesday backed president reagan's retaliatory strike against iranian targets in the gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy in the volatile region.     senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed monday's u.s. attack on two iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an iranian attack last friday on a kuwaiti ship flying the american flag.     the measure said the attack was a firm indication of u.s. resolve that iran "cannot take military action against the united states with impunity."     earlier, the senate cut off republican stalling tactics and set a vote on a measure that could give congress a larger role in making gulf policy. the measure, however, does not require reagan to comply with the 1973 war powers act, which could lead to a pullout of u.s. forces from the gulf.     while democrats and republicans praised the u.s. retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing u.s. involvement in the gulf and some demanded that reagan comply with the war powers act.  reuter &#3;</h3>
