	<h3>the u.s. court of international trade has upheld the international trade commission's refusal to extend countervailing duties on canadian hogs to include pork products, the national pork producers' council said.     the court's ruling came in an appeal to the trade commission's decision filed by the pork producers' council.     council president tom miller said he was disappointed by the court ruling and said the council will accelerate activities in support of an amendment to the 1930 tariff act that would address the objections outlined in the trade commission's ruling.     the commission had said there was insufficient economic integration between the pork production industry and the pork packing industry to justify extending the duty on live hogs to fresh, chilled or frozen pork.     the legislation has already passed the house of representatives and recently passed the senate finance committee. it is expected to be considered by the full senate by the end of the summer.     an appeal by the canadian pork council that the current countervailing duty on canadian hogs entering the u.s. be lifted is pending before the court.  reuter &#3;</h3>
