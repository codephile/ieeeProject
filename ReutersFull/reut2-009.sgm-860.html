	<h3><carolian systems international inc> said it anticipates profit for fiscal 1987 ending june 30 will be lower than fiscal 1986 earnings of 410,000 dlrs, despite an expected revenue increase of 37 pct to more than 3.5 mln dlrs.     after an extraordinary expense associated with the december, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering, "we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the 410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986," the company said.     carolian previously reported fiscal six month profit of 12,933 dlrs, excluding an extraordinary loss of 17,210 dlrs, compared to earnings of 69,829 dlrs in the prior year.     the company said it anticipated fiscal 1987 earnings to be lower due to withdrawal of its share offering, computer equipment shipment delays and costs associated with sales staff expansion.     a strengthening canadian dollar against u.s. currency will also adversely affect revenues and earnings, since 85 pct of revenues are generated by sales outside canada, said carolian, a leading supplier of utility software for hewlett-packard computer systems.  reuter &#3;</h3>
