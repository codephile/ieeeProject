	<h3>the short-term effect of foreign exchange rate movements in correcting international trade imbalances appears to be waning, and long-term efforts are required to cut japan's chronic dependence on external demand, the bank of japan said in a monthly report.     japan's trade surplus in nominal terms is likely to remain high in the near future, the central bank said.     fundamental adjustments will be needed as long as japan hopes to benefit from a better international allocation of resources and maintain the free trade system, it added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
