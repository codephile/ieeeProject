	<h3>the democratic-controlled house budget committee, over republican protests, approved and sent to the house a trillion dlr spending budget for 1988 that would cut the anticipated federal deficit by about 38 billion dlrs.     the democratic-written budget would produce about a 133 billion dlr deficit using the nonpartisan congressional budget office economic assumptions.     using president reagan's more optimistic assumptions the deficit would be about 108 billion dlrs -- which would reach a new budget law's goal.  reuter &#3;</h3>
