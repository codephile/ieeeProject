	<h3>japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa said the group of seven (g-7) nations still support the louvre accord to stabilise currencies.     he also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting that the group of five (g-5) and g-7 do not have any plans to meet for talks.     the finance minister further said that overseas stock market plunges will not lead to a freefall in the tokyo stock market. "there is no special worry about the stock market in tokyo," he added.     miyazawa said the tokyo stock market should not be gravely affected by the downturns of markets in new york and london because there is a clear sign of an economic recovery in japan and stability of exchange rates.     asked if the u.s. had contacted japan after the stock market plunge in new york, miyazawa said there was not any contact.  reuter &#3;</h3>
