	<h3>the house of seagram, seagram co ltd's u.s. marketing arm for joseph e. seagram and son's distilled spirits and wine coolers, said it is replacing its four current national spirits companies with a single sales force, one marketing unit and a centralized finance and administrative function.     effective may four, house of seagram said its sales force will operate nationally through seven, equal-sized regions, five in open states and two in control states, seagram said.     the change reflects a more aggressive marketing and sales focus on the local level, the company said.     a vice president-general manager will head each region, reporting to jerome mann, executive vice president, seagram said, adding that sales, seagram distillers, 375 spirits, perennial sales and summit sales will cease to exist as companies.     "we will no longer have individual spirits companies, the resulting internal competition for distributor and retailer attention or centalized decision making on virtually all issues," edgar bronfman, house of seagram president, said.     seagram said the group that markets seagram's line of wine coolers, the be caled the seagram beverage co, will not be affected by the reorganization.     the company added that seagram beverage will remain inside the house of seagram, but separate from the spirits unit.  reuter &#3;</h3>
