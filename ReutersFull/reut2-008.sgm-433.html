	<h3>duke power co said it began its licensing process for a new hydroelectric power plant on coley creek, near the towns of cashiers, n.c., and salem, s.c.     duke said it will decide whether to pursue the project once the licensing process is completed.     in order to be producing electricity by the turn of the century, the company said, it needed to start the four to six year licensing process now.     if the site is developed to its full potential of 2,100 megawatts, its cost will be slightly greater than three billion dlrs, including projected effects of inflation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
