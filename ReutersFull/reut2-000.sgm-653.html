	<h3>federal regulators said dean witter reynolds inc, the brokerage subsidiary of sears, roebuck and co, agreed to a censure to settle charges that it failed to fully report cash transactions.     in a complaint which was issued simultaneously with the settlement, the securities and exchange commission charged dean witter, the fourth largest u.s. brokerage house, with failing to report more than one mln dlrs of cash transactions.     in its administrative complaint, the sec stressed that was not charging dean witter with taking part in a scheme to launder cash.     but it said it found 35 single lump sum cash deposits in excess of 10,000 dlrs made with dean witter's branch offices and another three multiple cash deposits made by a customer on a single day which totaled more than 10,000 dlrs. the total unreported cash was 1,062,234 dlrs, the agency said.     federal law requires brokerage firms and banks to report to the treasury department all cash deposits greater than 10,000 dlrs.     after examining seven pct of the dean witter's branch offices between july 1983 and april 1985, the sec said it found that the firm reported 1,880,376 dlrs in cash deposits, each of which had been greater than 10,000 dlrs, but failed to report another 1,062,234 dlrs.     besides agreeing to the censure, dean witter agreed to tighten its oversight of its branch offices.     another major brokerage firm, e.f. hutton group inc, recently disclosed in an sec filing that a federal grand jury in providence, r.i., was probing its compliance with cash deposit reporting requirements at its providence office.  reuter &#3;</h3>
