	<h3>poland met the paris club of western creditor nations for renewed talks on rescheduling its debt repayments but no conclusive result was expected, diplomatic sources said.     they said the discussions, led on the polish side by deputy finance minister andrzej doroscz, were to renew contacts agreed after an inconclusive meeting in january and the talks were described as a "technical meeting."     the january talks focussed on the rescheduling of about 500 mln dlrs of interest and principal due by end-1986 and also touched upon delays in debt repayments recheduled previously.     poland has a 33.5 billion dollar debt to western creditor countries and commercial banks and has already indicated it will not be able to meet interest payments this year after falling behind for the past two years.     "the paris club is demanding repayment but poland needs new credits and has made certain supplementary proposals, but it is up to the club to show an initiative," one of the diplomatic sources said without elaborating.     poland is still continuing a dialogue with the international monetary fund but this is progressing slowly, the source said.     one diplomatic source said the key to poland's debt problem lay in london, saying that the commercial bank creditors there must take a practical position before a paris club decision.     "but their position seems to be hardening," the source said. "one really cannot expect a positive conclusion to today's talks," the source added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
