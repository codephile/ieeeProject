	<h3>the administration is expanding its crackdown on bad debts, officials of the white house office of management and budget (omb) told reporters.     omb deputy director joseph wright said the administration this year plans to turn over to private credit rating firms data on about 3.5 mln "deadbeats" who are seriously behind or in default in their payments on federal loans.     next year, the government will turn over to private collection bureaus four billion dlrs in bad education loans and three billion dlrs in other bad government loans, wright said.     the government is also considering letting individuals make payments on their student loans with credit cards, officials told reporters.     the internal revenue service is already studying the use of credit cards to pay income taxes, but this usage would require a change in federal law while no congressional action would be needed for credit cards to be used for student loans, the officials said.     the officials disclosed these plans in releasing the third annual omb report to congress on management of the u.s. government.     the report details steps to be taken by the administration to increase federal efficiency and to continue president reagan's highly publicized "war on waste, fraud and abuse."     according to the report, elinquent u.s. debt had soared to 68.3 billion dlrs, or 18.8 pct of total receivables, by the end of the fiscal year that ended last sept. 30. at the end of fiscal 1981, when reagan took office, bad debt stood at 29.8 billion dlrs or 12.3 pct of total debt.     but omb officials said other reagan administration efforts had already saved taxpayers 84 billion dlrs and would save another 25 billion dlrs or so by the time reagan left office.  reuter &#3;</h3>
