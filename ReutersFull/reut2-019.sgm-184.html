	<h3>federated financial savings and loan association said it wrote off its fslic secondary reserve balance, previously carried as an asset, as required by the federal home loan bank board.     the reduction of income is estimated to be 16 cts per share, but the company said it will record a profit for the third quarter ending june 30.     federated said the elimination of the reserve will not affect its ability to pay dividends to stockholders and will have a minimal impact on annual profits for the fiscal year ending sept 30, 1987.         federated said the secondary reserve consists of previous contributions to the fslic fund in excess of insurance premiums, along with accumulated earnings on those contributions.      reuter &#3;</h3>
