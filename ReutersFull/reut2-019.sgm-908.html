	<h3>middle south utilities inc said the federal energy regulatory commission has requested a 30-day stay of a u.s. court of appeals ruling ordering the commission to reconsider its allocation of costs from the grand gulf one nuclear power plant.     more than two years ago, ferc set the allocation af grand gulf capacity and costs among the four middle south operating companies. these allocations, in turn, have become the basis for contested rate filings the four operating utilities made to regulators in their service areas.     in a ruling dated june 24 and distributed june 26, the u.s. court of appeals in washington reversed its january 1987 decision and ordered ferc to explain its criteria for determining undue discrimination and why the ferc's allocation currently in effect is not unduly discriminatory under that definition, middle south said.     the company said the ruling by the three-judge appeals court panel "was totally unexpected, especially in light of the timetable the full 11-member court set in april of this year when it announced that all judges would rehear the panel's january decision in which the panel had upheld ferc.     in essence, middle south said, "the three-member panel has adopted the dissenting opinion as the new majority opinion, and the full court has accepted the new decision."     the company said it supports ferc's motion for a stay. the commission said it needed the time to determine the appropriate course it should take in light of the new court decision.     "given its complexity and the need for clarification by the ferc, the significance of this latest order will take time to determine," middle south said in a statement.  reuter &#3;</h3>
