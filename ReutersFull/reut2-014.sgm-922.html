	<h3>the european community (ec) is expected to award export licences at today's weekly tender for above 60,000 and possibly up to 100,000 tonnes of white sugar after last week's award for 102,350 tonnes, traders here said.     they expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50 ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week's 46.864.     earlier, traders in london said the outcome of the tender was very hard to predict after last week's substantial award and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention. they said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but declined to give a rebate figure.  reuter &#3;</h3>
