	<h3>canada's 1.20 billion dlr bond offer was virtually sold out as bond prices closed weaker in moderate trading, dealers said.     sales of today's issue were slowed by the decline in american credit markets and rising oil prices, which stirred concerns about inflation, the traders said. the issue was selling at or just below issue price.     overall prices fell as much as a point, with the benchmark canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001 at 106-3/8 5/8, the 8-1/4 pct of 1997 at 99 99-1/4 and the 8-1/2 pct of 2011 at 98-1/8 3/8.  reuter &#3;</h3>
