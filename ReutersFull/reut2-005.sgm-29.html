	<h3>goldman sachs international corp received forged bonds of a unit of exxon corp <xon> in a trade, a spokesman for goldman sachs and co inc said in a telephone conversation from new york.     he said the transaction left goldman sachs international with an exposure of about 2.2 mln dlrs but that it had insurance to cover the loss.     the spokesman was responding to an enquiry about an item in the london "standard" newspaper, which said goldman sachs "is feared to be the victim of a new multi-million pound city scandal."     the newspaper also said, "the firm (goldman sachs) is believed to be the paying agent for some 900 bonds issued in the name of oil giant exxon which were deposited at banks in brussels and have now been found to be forgeries."     the spokesman said that the bonds were delivered to the firm by a man working on behalf of a third party. he said it wasn't until the bonds were cleared through euro-clear (a major clearing house for the eurobond market) that it was discovered they were forgeries.     the spokesman also said he believed that the intermediary had been apprehended by police. however, a spokesman for the city of london police said he was unaware of such an arrest and could neither confirm nor deny it.     last friday, exxon corp said forgeries of a 20-year zero coupon euronote issued by its exxon capital corp subsidiary have been discovered in the european market. it also said morgan guaranty trust co was the fiscal agent and paying agent and that morgan, euro-clear and cedel (another major clearing system) and police in london and brussels were investigating the case.  reuter &#3;</h3>
