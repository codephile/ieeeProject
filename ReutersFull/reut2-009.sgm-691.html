	<h3>guyana hopes to overcome its financial problems within three to five years and is now seeking help from donor governments, finance minister carl greenidge said.     he said guyana took its problems in january to the caribbean group for cooperation and development, which includes governments and multilateral agencies, with a view to finding a long-term recovery plan.     guyana's arrears to the international monetary fund (imf) are now 70 mln dlrs and it would not be eligible for new loans in the near future, greenidge told reuters during the inter-american development bank (iadb) annual meeting here. more     greenidge also said a world bank mission would visit georgetown this week to assess prospects for a rescue plan that would enable guyana to revive its economy. but he said the government does not expect to be able to reduce its arrears this year.     arrears to the imf and the world bank are projected to rise to 100 mln dlrs by the end of 1987. about 90 mln dlrs of this, equivalent to nearly half guyana's annual exports, would be owed to the imf.     "expecting us to pay arrears is like asking a dying man to give a pint of blood," greenidge said.     but greenidge said guyana has taken steps to reduce its fiscal deficit, which now amounts to 65 pct of gdp. it has increased taxes, reduced public expenditure and refinanced its internal debt.     he said the world bank would meanwhile look at investment requirements for potential export-earning projects such as gold mining, timber, oil and kaolin.     because of its arrears, guyana has been unable to draw down a 40 mln dlr world bank loan for a bauxite industry rehabilitation project. bauxite accounts for 90 mln dlrs of exports, or 40 pct of the total.  reuter &#3;</h3>
