	<h3>finance minister kiichi miyazawa said that the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable to the perception inside and outside japan that the country has failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand.     he told a lower house budget committee in parliament that it was natural for other nations to think that japan is not doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88 budget.     the budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax.  reuter &#3;</h3>
