	<h3>regulations governing hedging and risk management should be revised and development of new futures instruments cautiously monitored in dealing with the growth of off-exchange futures instruments, robert davis, a commissioner on the commodity futures trading commission, cftc, said.     davis told the chicago chapter of the futures industry association commodity research division last night "there is no cause for undue alarm" in the growth of off-exchange instruments.     however, he said, the cftc "must clarify jurisdictional and regulatory issues" by maintaining the safeguards intended by commodity regulations while encouraging "the further development of competitive markets."  reuter &#3;</h3>
