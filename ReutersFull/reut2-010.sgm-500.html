	<h3>the united states told india it could purchase a supercomputer because u.s. concerns over a possible security breach had been removed.     u.s. officials said the united states did not specify which supercomputer it was willing to sell but had offered india a choice.     they declined to comment on a newspaper report that the united states wanted to sell india a computer less powerful than the indians had sought.     they said the united states was awaiting a response from new delhi.     the new york times, quoting unnamed government and industry officials, said the united states wanted to sell a weaker-model supercomputer to india.     u.s. and indian negotiatiors reached a tentative agreement in december on security precautions for the sale of the computer, which has a wide variety of military applications.     "we have told the indians that we ratify the tentative agreement reached in december," a u.s. official said.     india proposed to use the supercomputer to analyze weather patterns to forecast monsoons.     the sale of a u.s. supercomputer to a non-western nation is rare. this transaction was seen as a test of a technology-sharing agreement signed by prime minister rajiv gandhi and president reagan in 1985.     the american concern was that the advanced technology might fall into the hands of the soviet union, which is india's main weapons supplier.     one condition calls for u.s. personnel to service the computer in india for three years, a pentagon spokesman said.     the spokesman predicted the negotiations, which also involved the state department, could be quickly resolved.     the only countries which make the supercomputer are the united states and japan.     in new delhi, indian officials told reuters that a u.s. offer had been made.     "an announcement will be made in 10 days to two weeks time," an official said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
