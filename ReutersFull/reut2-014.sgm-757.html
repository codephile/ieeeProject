	<h3>moody's investors service inc said the credit quality of corporate bond issuers continued to decline in first quarter of 1987.     of all corporate ratings changes during the quarter, 66 pct were downgrades compared with 55 pct during all of 1986.     moody's said downgrades led upgrades last quarter by two to one. it downgraded 50 companies, affecting 61 billion dlrs of debt and upgraded 25 companies, affecting 9 billion dlrs of debt.     it said more than half of the quarter's downgrades were in the industrial sector, affecting 25 billion dlrs of debt.     moody's said that continued leveraged buyouts and restructuring among small and medium-sized companies will account for up to one-quarter of coporate debt downgrades.     worldwide competition and overcapacity will continue to take its toll on industrial companies, moody's added. it said intensifying competition in an environment of slow economic growth, moody's predicts 2.5 pct worldwide growth in 1987, will lower returns and margins for many multinational firms.     bank and finance company downgrades outpaced upgrades by 16 to 6 respectively. it said this trend will continue because of latin american debt problems.  reuter &#3;</h3>
