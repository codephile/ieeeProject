	<h3>senate democratic leader robert byrd yesterday failed to win the 60 votes needed to force a senate vote on a bill demanding president reagan account for u.s. aid to the nicaraguan contras, including millions of dollars diverted to the rebels from u.s. arms sales to iran.     following the defeat, byrd said he would drop his effort, ending congressional manoeuvring over the 40 million dlr final instalment of a 100-million-dlr aid package approved last year for the contras.     without congressional action to stop it, the aid became legally available to the contras last weekend.  reuter &#3;</h3>
