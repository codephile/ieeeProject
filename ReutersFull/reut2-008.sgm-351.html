	<h3>the supreme court let stand a ruling that threw out a 36-mln-dlr judgment that western union telegraph co had been ordered to pay to a now-defunct independent teleprinter vendor.     the justices, without comment, left intact a ruling last july by a u.s. court of appeals in chicago that threw out the jury's 1985 verdict and judgment in a major antitrust case.     the case stemmed from a 1977 lawsuit filed by olympia equipment leasing co, alfco telecommunications co and the companies' late founder, abraham feldman of san francisco.  reuter &#3;</h3>
