	<h3>datacard corp said it adopted a dividend rights plan in response to deluxe check printers inc <dlx> having agreed to sell its 38 pct interest in datacard to national computer systems inc <nlcs.o>.     datacard declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right on each outstanding share its common stock. the dividend is designed to deter national computer or other potential suitors from preventing datacard from evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value, datacard said.         national computer told reuters june 22 it could make a bid for datacard. on june 25 datacard filed suit in hennepin county district court in minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct stake of its stock to national computer.     in announcing the rights plan, datacard said it "is not designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of datacard's stockholders."     the rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 44 pct or more of datacard's common stock.         once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy 1/500th of a share of datacard series a junior participation preferred stock for 35 dlrs. holders other than an acquirer would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred stock with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of the rights.     the rights dividend distribution is payable july 9 to shareholders of record july 9.  reuter &#3;</h3>
