	<h3>thai zinc ingot exports fell to 882 tonnes in march from 1,764 in february and 3,008 in march 1986, the mineral resources department said.     a spokesman for padaeng industry co ltd, the country's sole exporter, attributed the decline to the company's lower stocks, which averaged 5,000 tonnes in the first quarter against 16,000 tonnes in late 1985 when it began exporting.     the department said major buyers included china, japan, the philippines, south korea, singapore and taiwan.     thailand exported 4,842 tonnes of zinc ingots during the first quarter, down from 14,937 a year ago.  reuter &#3;</h3>
