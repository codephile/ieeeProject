	<h3>software ag systems inc said it expects to report earnings for its third quarter "substantially weaker" than earnings of prior periods due to an unexpected shortfall in u.s. domestic license revenues.     for the second quarter ended november 30, software ag earned 2,089,000 dlrs, down from 5,014,000 dlrs a year before. in last year's third quarter, software ag earned 1,598,000 dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
