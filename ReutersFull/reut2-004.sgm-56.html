	<h3>the australian wheat board's (awb) 1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes already sold, awb general manager ron paice said.     "we are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export target for the year," he said in a statement.     he did not detail the commitments already made, but an awb spokesman said they include sales to egypt, china, iran, the soviet union and iraq.     in the 1985/86 wheat year ended september 30, the awb exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.     paice also said the 1986/87 australian wheat harvest has ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the awb.     the season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.     however, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final guaranteed minimum price for 1986/87, he said.     paice did not give a crop estimate, but the awb's february wheat australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.     but the awb spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes. the official estimate is not yet available.     in the 1985/86 season, the awb received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop.     another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000 sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the awb's receival system, according to bureau of agricultural economics data.  reuter &#3;</h3>
