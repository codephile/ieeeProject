	<h3>the asian development bank (adb) will open an office in jakarta later this year to speed up work on indonesian projects, bank vice-president s. stanley katz said.     "we have very large projects in indonesia and we would like to accelerate their implementation," katz told reuters.     indonesia is the largest recipient of adb lending. it received 118 loans worth 3.7 billion dlrs for 112 projects between 1968 and 1986, 19.0 pct of the adb's total lending. ordinary capital resources (ocr) lending to indonesia was 3.6 billion dlrs, 27.1 pct of ocr loans at end-december 1986.     jakarta has also received loans worth 162 mln dlrs from the bank's asian development fund.     adb sources said indonesia's cumulative disbursements at end-1986 amounted to only 1.1 billion dlrs or 30 pct of loans received. "project implementation is very slow in indonesia and we are not very satisfied with the pace. we hope the new office might help," gunther schulz, adb vice-president in charge of projects, said.     planned projects were further slowed down in 1986 because of the country's budgetary problems, he added. indonesia's revenue from oil exports was cut in half last year.     "decision making is quite slow, complicated and very centralised," schulz told reuters.     indonesian president suharto set up a high-level team in july last year to speed up projects using adb funds. adb sources said bank staff have been stationed intermittently in jakarta in response to government requests.     the jakarta office will be the third adb office outside its manila headquarters. the bank has a resident office in dhaka and a south pacific regional office in vanuatu.  reuter &#3;</h3>
