	<h3>robert salomon, managing director of salomon inc, said the company's second quarter is "likely to be comfotrably in the black, but down from the comparable year-ago quarter," when salomon earned 117 mln dlrs or 78 cts a share on a primary basis.     "its been a difficult quarter," salomon told reuters, adding that financial analysts today lowered their second quarter earnings estimate for the company to 30 cts to 50 cts per share from a range of 75 cts to 80 cts a share.     salomon's stock closed at 34-3/4, off one, on heavy trading.         salomon said he was deluged with calls from analysts after yesterday's announcement by first boston inc <fbc> that it will report a loss for the second quarter due to steep losses in the bond market during april.     salomon acknowledged that the quarter was "difficult" but said the company will report a profit for the period.  reuter &#3;</h3>
