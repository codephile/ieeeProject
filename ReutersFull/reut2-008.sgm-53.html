	<h3>the federal home loan bank board said dallas-based vernon savings and loan association, the 15th largest thrift in texas, was closed by state authorities and its assets, deposits and liabilities were transfered to a new federally chartered association.     vernon, with 1.35 billion dlrs of assets and nine offices in texas and oklahoma, was closed after state regulators concluded it was in unsafe and unsound condition.     the thrift was owned by texas businessman donald dixon, who bought it in early 1982, when it had only 120 mln dlrs in assets.     the bank board said growth was accomplished largely through the purchase of brokered deposits and the sale of jumbo certificates of deposit, which totaled 29 pct of total deposits at the end of 1986.     the bank board also said that 96 pct of its loan portfolio was nonperforming as a result of sloppy loan practices.     it said vernon also paid excessive salaries and dividends to officers and directors and bought a beach house and five airplances for the use of thrift executives and stockholders.     the bank board ousted the thrift's officers and directors and hired another texas association to run it.     the bank board also said it closed first federal of maryland, a federal savings association that had 115.2 mln dlrs in assets. it said its 118 mln dlrs in insured deposits were transferred to columbia first federal savings and loan association of washington, d.c.     the bank board said first federal had engaged in unsound loan underwriting practices and many of the loans are now deliquent. the institution experienced heavy and continuing losses and became insolvent, the bank board said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
