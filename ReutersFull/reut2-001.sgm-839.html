	<h3>pan am corp said its pan american world airways unit will reduce management costs by 20 pct, or about 80 mln dlrs, through job cuts, salary freezes and other measures.     pan am also said it has asked its labor unions to help lower costs by an additional 180 mln dlrs.     the airline said it will eliminate 464 managment positions and freeze all management salaries, a move that will save 30 mln dlrs a year.     an additional 50 mln dlrs of expenses under management's control will also be cut, it said without offering details.     pan am said it is seeking a 20 pct pay cut from its unions.     pan am vice chairman martin r. shugrue said in a statement, "management is leading the way, but with 40 pct of our operating expenses represented by labor costs, we must have the cooperation of our labor unions if we are to make additional improvements to our 1987 operating plan."     shugrue asked pan am's unions to begin negotiations on the pay cuts immediately.  reuter &#3;</h3>
