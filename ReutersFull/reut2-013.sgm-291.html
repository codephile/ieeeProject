	<h3>european community unemployment fell slightly in february to just under 17 mln from 17.1 mln in january, the ec statistic's agency eurostat said.     it said the fall came despite a bad winter in most of the ec when seasonal factors could be expected to have had a more adverse effect.     however, the agency added, the long-term trend was virtually unchanged stating that compared to february 1986 the number of registered unemployed increased by 222,000.  reuter &#3;</h3>
