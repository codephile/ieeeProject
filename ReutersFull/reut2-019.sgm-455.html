	<h3>argentine president raul alfonsin met for more than an hour with international monetary fund managing director michel camdessus, and argentine economy minister juan sourrouille said the two men discussed argentina's economy and its commercial bank financing package.     sourrouille told reporters that 91.5 pct of the 1.95 billion dlr loan, which forms the core of the package, has been subscribed.     citibank, the chairman of argentina's bank advisory committee, said yesterday that subscriptions totalled about 91 pct.     the imf has said that a "critical mass" of bank commitments is needed before it will start disbursing the 1.83 billion dlr standby loan that it has approved in principle for argentina.     asked what the imf has stipulated as a critical mass, sourrouille said, "that has not been defined but anywhere over 90 pct we are doing fine."     although most of the money has been subscribed, officials noted that about a third of argentina's 350 creditor banks hold 93 pct of its debt. they are worried that it might take a long time to persuade the other banks to join the deal.     monetary sources said alfonsin and camdessus, who had not met before, mostly discussed argentina's political and economic situation. alfonsin, who is beginning a four-day private visit to the u.s., was in philadelphia to speak to the private world affairs council, a non-partisan body dedicated to increasing public awareness of international affairs.     in his speech, alfonsin said economic integration is the only way for latin america to overcome its current crisis.     "this (economic integration) is probably the most audacious challenge facing latin america this century, perhaps the most audacious of our history," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
