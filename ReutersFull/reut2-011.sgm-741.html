	<h3>brazil's leading political party has expressed full support to president jose sarney's decision suspending interest payment of 68 billion dollars owed to private foreign banks.     besides expressing its support, the government's brazilian democratic movement party (pmdb) urged sarney to keep on with his decision "up to the last consequences."     conducted by veteran party leader ulysses guimaraes, head of brazil's constituent assembly, the pmdb praised finance minister dilson funaro for his courage to propose suspension of interest payment of the debt for an indefinite period.     the brazilian government announced suspension of interest payment on part of its 109-billion dlrs foreign debt on february 20.     "the road to dignity has no return," said a document issued by the pmdb.     the party said the government's decision also had the support of all sectors of society, including the governors of 22 brazilian states.     the statement said brazil had two ways to take: "a return, by way of submission to manoeuvres and outside pressure... or the way which leads the country to its independence."  reuter &#3;</h3>
