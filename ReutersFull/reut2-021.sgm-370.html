	<h3>the international telecommunications union, which regulates communications worldwide, decided at the end of a five-week conference to allow mobile phone systems to be linked with satellites, telecommunications officials said.     until now, car phones have been linked with land stations and have been limited mainly to urban areas. the new ruling will make it easier for calls to be made from remote regions.     the meeting, which finished over the weekend, also decided to allow a "radio determination satellite system," which would enable fleet owners to trace to within about 15 metres the movements of their lorries or cars or ships around the world.  reuter &#3;</h3>
