	<h3>the bank of england will step up reporting requirements for primary dealers in u.k. government gilts during the when-issued trading period in between the date an auction is announced and the date the sale is actually held.     in its document on the auctions, the bank said "the bank is content for such (when-issued) trading to cevelop subject to certain conditions, in particular for predential supervision of the credit risk to which the gilt-edged market makers and inter-dealer brokers may become exposed."     the bank is widely expected to require dealers to report wehn-issued trading positions on a daily basis.     when-issued trading presents certain unusual risks because dealers are buying and selling a security that technically does not exist although there is no uncertainty about when it will be issued.     still, the fact there is no physical delivery possible presents certain credit risks as well.     the bank is widely expected to expand its reporting requiremenmts for unsettled trades, requiring firms to report unsettled when-issued trades one day after they occur. normally, unsettled trades must be reported three days after they occur.  reuter &#3;</h3>
