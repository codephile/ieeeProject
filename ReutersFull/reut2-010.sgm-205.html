	<h3><glenwood inc> said it is recalling lot number 54238 of its potaba tablet (aminobenzoate potassium), a prescription drug used mainly to treat scleroderma, a painful skin thickening condition.     it said 5,474 bottles of 100 tablets were distributed nationwide. the product is made by vitarine pharmaceuticals of springfield gardens, n.y, exclusively under the glenwood label.     glenwood said the recall is due to the pacakging of a non-prescription tablet containing ammonium chloride and caffeine with the potaba tablets.     only one lot number is involved, but the company said it urges all potaba tablets purchased since january 1987 be  discontinued if a lot number cannot be identified.     it said potaba therapy requires about 24 tablets a day, and in the mispackaged bottles patients could take excessively large doses of caffeine and chloride which could produce rapid heart beats, anxiety, and other ill health effects.  reuter &#3;</h3>
