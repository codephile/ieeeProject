	<h3>the house banking committee voted 45-5 in favor of a bill to raise five billion dlrs over two years to assist the federal savings and loan insurance corp.     the federal home loan banks would borrow the five billion dlrs in financial markets to assist the fslic, which government auditors have said is approaching  bankruptcy.     the committee narrowly rejected a version of the legislation that would have permitted 15 billion dlrs in borrowing authority over a longer time and was the version favored by the administration.     the committee, backed by committee chariman fernand st germain (d-ri) and house speaker jim wright (d-tex), voted 25-24 to change the amount of borrowing authority.     in addition to the funds raised in capital markets, the fslic would receive another five billion dlrs in assessments on financial institutions belonging the fund.     the bill also requires regulators to apply more liberal standards when deciding whether to close ailing thrifts in depressed regions.     the bill now goes to the full house.     the senate has passed a bill providing for a 7.5 billion dlr recapitalization for fslic.  reuter &#3;</h3>
