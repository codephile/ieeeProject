	<h3>united press international  announced that milton benjamin had resigned as company president and the news agency's chairman, mario vazquez-rana, a mexican newspaper owner, would take over his duties.     the agency, which emerged from bankruptcy court protection when vazquez-rana bought it for 41 mln dlrs last june, has had four presidents over the past year.     benjamin, who had served in the post since last november, said he was stepping down because restoring upi would take a greater financial investment than he had envisaged and vasquez-rana thus wished to take direct control.     "in recent weeks, mario (vazquez-rana) has indicated that in light of the increased investment, he wants to devote even more time to upi and to play a more direct role in managing its financial affairs," benjamin said in a statement.     benjamin said he would return to his consulting firm of anderson, benjamin, read and haney inc., which he founded in 1984. he left the firm on november six last year to take over as president of upi.     besides benjamin and vazquez-rana, the other presidents have been luis nogales, a california businessman who helped steer the agency through bankruptcy proceedings, and maxwell mccrohon, former editor and managing editor of the chicago tribune.     vazquez-rana, who is both chairman and chief executive officer of upi, is the publisher of a successful chain of 62 newspapers in mexico, chairman of the mexican olympics committee and chairman of the worldwide association of national olymnpics committees.  reuter &#3;</h3>
