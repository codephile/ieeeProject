	<h3>the government adopted an 8,829 billion yen stop-gap budget for fiscal 1987 starting april 1 to compensate for the delay in the passage through the parliament of the full 1987/88 budget.     the provisional budget includes 1,862 billion yen in public works spending to help stimulate the economy and meet overseas demand for japan to import more and reduce its huge trade surplus, officials said.     they said the stop-gap budget will be in effect for 50 days through may 20 and is the largest ever.     the budget includes 1,580 billion yen in new government bond issues.     officials said the spending on public works accounts for about two-sevenths of the 6,017 billion yen in public works outlay set aside in the pending formal 1987/88 budget.     the planned full budget totals 54,101 billion yen.     the government had to work out the stop-gap budget because budget debates have been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business in protest against a planned five pct sales tax.  reuter &#3;</h3>
