	<h3>the international monetary fund said it approved a 48 mln dlr loan to assist ecuador in meeting its foreign exchange needs following the earthquakes that struck in march.     the loan, which the imf provides countries under special circumstances, is equal to 25 pct of ecuador's quota, or economic standing, in the fund.     the imf said that according to recent estimates, the earthquakes will hurt the country's balance of payments this year because of the loss of oil revenues due to destruction of part of the oil pipeline.  reuter &#3;</h3>
