	<h3>the cabinet has approved a bill making it easier for the government to issue commemorative coins, a finance ministry official said.     the bill, which must still be approved by parliament, would take effect in april 1988. it would allow the government to issue 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 yen coins without special legislation, although higher-valued coins would still need a special law, the official said. at present it can only issue coins of 500 yen or less.  reuter &#3;</h3>
