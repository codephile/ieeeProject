	<h3>argentina's controversial new financing package should be completed quickly thanks to a wide range of innovative options in the deal, said jorge gonzalez, undersecretary for external debt in the economics ministry.     the deal offers banks a lucrative fee if they sign early and an "exit bond" provision allowing banks to sell as much as five mln dlrs of their existing loans. gonzalez also disclosed that banks will have the choice of lending up to one mln dlrs in the form of a bearer bond. "we expect to complete the package very quickly," he said in a telephone interview.     by providing their share of the 1.55 billion dlrs in new money being raised for argentina via an easily tradable bearer bond instead of a participation in the syndicated loan, smaller banks could avoid time-consuming legal paperwork.     the bonds, currently dubbed "alternative participation instruments," would carry the same terms as the syndicated loan - a 12-year term, five years' grace and an interest rate margin of 7/8 pct over eurodollar rates, gonzalez said.     the idea of the "exit bond" is that a creditor bank may exchange up to five mln dlrs of existing debt for a new, tradeable bond that bears below-market interest rates.     in return for accepting a lower yield, the amount of debt converted will be subtracted from the bank's exposure for purposes of calculating its contribution to future new loans.     gonzalez said it was difficult to say how many banks would take up the "exit bonds" because no such instrument has been offered before.     on paper, however, argentina's lending syndicate could shrink dramatically because over 100 of the country's 350 creditors have exposure of less than five mln dlrs.     details of the "exit bonds" are still being finalized, gonzalez added.     argentina has pressed hard for a streamlining of the lending process because it has bitter memories of its last package, which was agreed with the citibank-led steering committee in december 1984 but not signed until august 1985.     gonzalez praised the committee for its cooperation in the latest negotiations and said the resulting deal, which was announced by the banks on wednesday, should put argentina on the road to meeting its economic goals.     "we believe this is a package that will help argentine to continue on the track it has elected to follow - stable growth and equilibrium in the external accounts," he said.     asked what role the reagan administration had played in the final stages of the talks, gonzalez said it had lent "practical support."     he did not elaborate, but bankers said the u.s. had pressed for an agreement after economics minister juan sourrouille threatened at last week's spring meeting in washington of the international monetary fund to break off talks unless banks stopped blocking a deal.     the specter of argentina emulating brazil and suspending interest payments haunted policymakers and bankers alike, who have long feared the emergence of a debtors' cartel.     "that was a feeling among people on the committee," one banker said.     as a result bankers agreed to give argentina the same interest rate margin as mexico, 13/16 pct, on the rescheduling of 30 billion dlrs of debt, even though they knew this would raise the ire of the philippines and venezuela, which paid 7/8 pct on recent rescheduling packages.     asked about the angry reaction of the manila government, which promptly said wednesday that it would demand a spread of 13/16 pct, gonzalez said this was a matter between the philippines and the banks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
