	<h3>pennzoil co chairman j. hugh liedtke said the company has made several proposals to texaco inc <tx>  to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to pennzoil and that a settlement was "in the best interests of both companies."     liedtke, in a letter mailed today to pennzoil shareholders, said texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recent public statements that pennzoil was not interested in settling the case.     "pennzoil has made texaco several proposals, both before and after trial, to settle this dispute," liedtke said in the letter. "we do not know why texaco's officials would now make such clearly untrue statements."     last month, a texas state appeals court upheld a jury judgment that texaco illegally interfered with pennzoil's plan to acquire getty oil in 1983. the appeals court reduced by two billion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awarded to pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed the total amount back above 10 billion dlrs.     pennzoil said that texaco had made four unsatisfactory proposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit.     "other than to put on the record that it has made offers, texaco's proposals make no sense," liedtke said in the letter. "in fact, two of texaco's offers were identical and were proposals that texaco knew in advance pennzoil would not accept."     the letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers made by either pennzoil or texaco.     "if and when texaco's management changes its position and demonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt to settle this matter, pennzoil will make every effort to cooperate," liedtke said. "such a solution, i believe, is clearly in the interests of both companies, even if it not attractive, as a personal matter, to texaco's management and directors."     liedtke said that cash flow from the getty oil assets and profits from those assets that have since been sold "approximately equaled" texaco's purchase price of 10 billion dlrs for getty.               reuter &#3;</h3>
