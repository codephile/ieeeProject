	<h3>spanish farm minister carlos romero, speaking at a meeting of ec farm ministers, called for action to help the spanish maize market, spanish diplomatic sources said.     spain is threatened with massive imports from third countries by the end of the year, they said.     they said the imports are due to come in as a result of the accord by which the ec has promised the united states it will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum into spain from third countries this year.     around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a reduced levy system and the ec cereals management committee may decide this week to authorise the spanish intervention board to make direct purchases.     the sources said romero urged that other ec countries should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the spanish market.     they said he threatened to withhold support for the ec commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached would mean price cuts unless spain received some help.     the sources said no direct reply was given to romero at the meeting.  reuter &#3;</h3>
