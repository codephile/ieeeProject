	<h3>the results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development, oecd, show japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies.     results of the study, which has not been released by oecd because of objections from some countries, were provided to reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified.     the oecd study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent, pse.     the study shows that on dairy products japan's pse, or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged 83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the european community at 68.8 pct and the united states 48.2 pct.     for wheat japan's pse averaged 95.8 pct, the ec 28.1 and the u.s. 17.2. japan's rice pse was 68.8 pct compared to the ec 13.6 and the u.s. 5.4 pct, the oecd calculations show.     in coarse grains, japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct compared with 27.9 pct for the ec and 13.1 pct for the u.s. japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the ec and 9.5 pct for the u.s., oecd concluded.     for sugar, japan's pse was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the ec and 13.1 pct for the u.s., the study shows.     the oecd calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as canada, australia and new zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the u.s., ec and japan, the sources said.     subsidies in argentina and brazil, two major developing country producers of commodities, were not included in the oecd work.     officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the oecd ministerial meeting in paris during may.     some officials hope the oecd results will be used as a  basis for negotiations during the uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in geneva.     british agriculture minister michael jopling during a visit to washington this week endorsed the oecd work as a starting point for the uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.     he said the pse calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture.     however, the oecd study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials familiar with the study said.     the u.s. agriculture department's economic research service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the oecd results and update them to 1982-84.     in some cases the results were substantially different than the oecd's, in part because farm policies in both the u.s. and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the oecd base period of 1979-81, u.s. officials said.     for example, the usda study found the united states subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49 pct, than in the ec, at zero to nine pct.     french maize producers association president marcel cazale, citing the result of the usda calculation for corn, told reporters last week that the united states subsidizes its farmers more than the ec.     however, the sources said ec corn subsidies are probably higher than the u.s. now because of increases since 1984.     officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to oecd so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation.     the updated calculations, which may take several months to complete, are expected to show substantial increases in u.s. subsidy levels for sugar because the u.s. imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.     u.s. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
