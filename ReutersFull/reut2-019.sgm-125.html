	<h3>canada post presented its striking letter carriers with a new contract offer today but both sides said there was little indication the offer would end an increasingly violent three-day-old walkout.     the strike has been especially bitter in quebec, where the federally regulated postal service has brought in replacement workers in contravention of provincial laws that prohibit hiring strikebreakers.     canada post said letter carriers in chicoutimi and jonquiere, quebec, damaged mail sorting rooms, ripped out telephone lines and letter racks, overturned furniture and threw mail on the floor before walking out to join carriers in other cities on the picket line.     the rotating strike spread today to the atlantic provinces and vancouver. carriers remained off the job in edmonton and vancouver while postal employees went back to work in montreal, calgary, and cornwall, ontario.     about 20 people were arrested in eastern canada as strikers scuffled with police called in to escort replacement workers across picket lines.     letter carriers union of canada president robert mcgarry said the new offer to the union's 20,000 members contained only minor changes and did not soften the agency's demand for concessions.     canada post officials said the agency is limited by federal guidlines which order the agency to eliminate its 160 mln dlrs deficit by next year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
