	<h3>digital communications associates said the new personal computers announced yesterday by international business machines corp <ibm> are expected to have little near-term effect on digital communications.     the company said some product modifications will be required, but they appear to be straight forward and do not represent major development challenges.     the company said it will pursue two prime areas -- the configuration of its products for use with mocrosoft corp's <msft> new operating system which has been adopted for use in the ibm products, and changes requried by the use of a new bus architecture in certain ibm products.  reuter &#3;</h3>
