	<h3>jordan is to receive 98.8 mln dlrs in loans to finance development projects, planning minister taher kan'an said.     kan'an told reporters the loans, concluded during the past six months, were made by the european investment bank, the islamic development bank and three arab funds. he gave no other details.     kan'an said the loans were for jordan's own nine billion dlr 1986-1990 development plan and not for the parallel, controversial 1.3 billion dlr plan for the israeli-occupied west bank and the gaza strip.     he said jordan would concentrate on obtaining concessionary foreign loans and keep commercial borrowings to a minimum.     performance in the first year of the national plan was close to target, the minister said. the gross domestic product at factor cost grew 2.4 per cent instead of the planned 2.9 per cent, he added, but gave no figures.     kan'an said public investment was also near the planned level, but investments by the private sector fell below expectations. "the private sector still feels inhibited," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
