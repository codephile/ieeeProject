	<h3>central bankers said they were generally satisfied with the response to the paris accord two weeks ago to stabilize currencies at around current levels.     speaking after a meeting at the bank for international settlements (bis), which reviewed the agreement, they also welcomed interest rates cuts in france and today's drop in british rates.  one top official said the rate cuts would help to stimulate growth generally in europe and welcomed that countries other than west germany were seen to be helping sustain the economy.      the central bankers, who spoke on the condition they not be named, said the meeting of governors from the group of 10 countries also heard a report from michel camdessus, the new managing director of the international monetary fund, on the imf's latest assessment of the debt crisis. in particular, they discussed brazil's debt moratorium.     but there was no sense of urgency, they said, and brazil had made no appeal for bridging loans from the bis or central banks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
