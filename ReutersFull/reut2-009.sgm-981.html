	<h3>the senate voted to condemn the proposed european common market tax on vegetable and fish fats and oils and said it would result in retaliation.     the non binding senate resolution, a sense of senate sentiment, was approved on a 99 to 0 vote.     "the administration should communciate to the european community the message that the united states will view the establishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the european community's obligations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade that will result in the adoption of strong and immediate countermeasures," the resolution stated.  reuter &#3;</h3>
