	<h3>brazilian economic officials confirmed a renewal of short-range credit lines by commercial creditors, bringing optimism that renegotiation of the 109 billion dlrs foreign debt is possible.     finance ministry sources said a "large majority" of foreign banks had accepted to extend brazil's credit lines before the midnight deadline of march 31 for payment of 15 billion dlrs servicing expired.     finance minister dilson funaro told reporters all short range credit lines were renewed, "without exception."     central bank sources, although incapable of confirming that 100 pct of the banks had renewed the credit lines, said that there was a massive affirmative reply.     the credit lines were extended in their majority by 30 days, but there were banks which renewed the deadline by 90 days and, sometimes, by 180 days, funaro told reporters.     brazil is pledging for an extension of the deadlines for an indefinite period, until its economic officials seek a global renegotiation of the debt.     last week brazil had suggested to creditors an extension of the deadline for another two months, until may 31.  reuter &#3;</h3>
