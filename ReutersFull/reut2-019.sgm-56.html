	<h3>the joint committee of taiwan's soybean importers awarded a contract to cargill inc of minneapolis, minnesota, for supply of one 32,000 tonne cargo of u.s. soybeans, a committee spokesman told reuters.     the cargo, priced at 249.10 u.s. dlrs per tonne c and f taiwan, is set for delivery before july 7, he said.     the committee cancelled a tender for another cargo because the prices offered by u.s. suppliers were too high, he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
