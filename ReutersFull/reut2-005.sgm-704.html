	<h3>consul restaurant corp chief financial officer robert lamp told analysts a previously announced conversion offer will reduce its debt-to-equity ratio to 55 pct from 380 pct, assuming full acceptance of the offer.     as of november 30, the company had about 26 mln dlrs of total debt outstanding.     earlier, consul said it would exchange 174,912 shares of convertible preferred stock for 17.5 mln dlrs of outstanding 13 pct debentures.     lamp said that excess debt due to its withdrawal from the texas marketplace has been the key factor to blocking further progress.     the mexican restaurant franchisee reported a net loss of 415,493 dlrs for the six months ended november 30, 1986.     acceptance of exchange offer by 90 pct of the debenture holders will enable consul to decrease its outstanding indebtedness and report profitably beginning in the first quarter of 1988, lamp told analysts.      reuter &#3;</h3>
