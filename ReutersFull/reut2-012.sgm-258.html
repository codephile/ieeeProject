	<h3><royal bank of canada> said it is raising its u.s. base lending rate by 1/4 pct to 8-1/4 pct, effective tomorrow.     the move is the first change in the bank's u.s. dollar base lending rate since last august, when it lowered the rate 1/2 point.     it follows the announcement yesterday of a 1/4 point rise to 7-3/4 pct of two of the largest u.s. banks' prime rates.  reuter &#3;</h3>
