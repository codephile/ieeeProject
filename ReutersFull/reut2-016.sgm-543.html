	<h3>the ruling liberal democratic party's (ldp) setback in sunday's nationwide local elections may force the government to water down its controversial proposal for a five pct sales tax and undermine its commitment to stimulating the economy, private economists said.     the ldp's failure to win seats in some crucial local constituencies will weaken the government's ability to push through its tax plan, and without a compromise tax proposal the budget for fiscal 1987/88 ending march 31 is unlikely to be passed soon, they said.     without the budget, the government would also be hard-pressed to come up with an effective package to stimulate the economy as pledged at group of seven meetings in paris in late february and in washington last week, they said.     opposition protests against the sales tax have stalled parliamentary debate on the budget for weeks and forced the government to enact a stop-gap 1987/88 budget that began early this month.     "the ldp's election setback will have an enormous impact on the already faltering economy," said johsen takahashi, chief economist at mitsubishi research institute.     takahashi said that behind the ldp's poor showing was public discontent with the government's high-handed push for tax reform and its lack of effective policies to cope with economic woes caused by the yen's appreciation.     "this explains why the ldp failed to regain governorships in the most hotly contested constituencies of fukuoka and hokkaido, where the shipbuilding and steel industries are suffering heavily from the yen's extended rise," he said.     takahashi said the government should delay introduction of the sales tax for one or two years beyond its original starting date of january 1988 and implement tax cuts now.  reuter &#3;</h3>
