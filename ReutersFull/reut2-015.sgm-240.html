	<h3>analysts at salomon brothers inc say the outlook for stock markets worldwide is postivie, although total returns in the u.s. stock market are not expected to exceed 10 pct over the next 12 months.     the report by robert salomon jr and caroline davenport said that after a strong first quarter, which saw u.s. stock market indices rise more than 20 pct, the direction of the market is still upward because slower economic growth will stretch out the recovery period. the firm expects profits for companies in the standard and poor's 500 stock index to rise 17 pct in 1987 and 18 pct in 1988.      the bullish global outlook is underpinned by continued but subdued economic growth, fiscal restraint, good liquidity and increasing profits, salomon said.     the salomon analysts say potential risks which must be monitored include any shift toward protectionism and foreign buying of u.s. stocks particularly by the japanese. "a sharp run-up in stock prices in secondary stocks" would be a warning sign, as would a big increase in enthusiasm for the initial public offering market," salomon said.     salomon said global diversification of equity markets has reached a new peak.  reuter &#3;</h3>
