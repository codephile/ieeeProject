	<h3>european consortium airbus industrie said it had no comment on press reports that it had resumed talks with u.s. mcdonnell douglas corp over a possible joint development and production of airliners.     a spokesman at airbus headquarters in toulouse said in a telephone interview: "we have no knowledge of talks and have no comment to make."     talks broke off last autumn after the two rivals failed to agree on cooperation over a new long-range jet. mcdonnell douglas wanted airbus to help build its md-11, while airbus insisted mcdonnell drop the md-11 and cooperate over its a340.  reuter &#3;</h3>
