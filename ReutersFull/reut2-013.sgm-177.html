	<h3>standard and poor's corp said that the credit quality of most u.s. cable television companies is unlikely to improve in the near term.     s and p said that after two years and many delays and disappointments, the cable television industry has firmly established a net cash generating position.     however, rather than using their improved position to decrease the leverage of current capital structures, the companies' cash flows are being fully leveraged to finance a wave of consolidations, s and p said.     many cable television companies exhibit greater financial risk because of their asset growth aspirations and debt-financed consolidation. that delays a lower risk profile for many of them, standard and poor's said.     the acquisition and financial growth policies of many company executives heavily influenced the ratings outlook.     citing aggressive capital structures, acquisitions and cash flow coverages of interest expense of between 1.0 and 1.5 times, s and p noted that the companies are more debt intensive now than in their building phase. these factors keep their ratings at speculative grades, the agency concluded.  reuter &#3;</h3>
