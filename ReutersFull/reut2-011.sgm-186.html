	<h3>hitachi ltd <hit.t> expects to achieve its parent company sales estimate of 2,900 billion yen in the year ending march 31, helped by high general-use ultra-large computer sales and despite the higher-than-expected yen.     current profits are unlikely to reach the estimated 90 billion yen as the currency's rise has reduced the value of foreign bond holdings, but the company will retain a nine yen dividend for 1986/87, a spokesman said.     current profits in the year to end-march 1986 fell 38.2 pct from a year before to 158.04 billion yen on sales of 3,003 billion, down 0.8 pct, mainly due to the yen's appreciation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
