	<h3>nec electronics inc, a unit of nec corp <nipny> said a u.s. district court judge denied nec's motion to disqualify judge william ingram from presiding over its lawsuit against intel corp <intc>.     nec said it sought to disqualify the judge when it learned in october 1986 that ingram had an ownership interest in an investment club that owned intel stock.     ingram reported that his interest in intel through the club amounted to about 80 dlrs worth of intel's stock and the judge ended his participation in the investment club after nec moved to have him disqualified, an nec spokeswoman said.     nec said it intends to appeal the ruling.     nec sued intel in december 1984 seeking a judgement declaring that microcode, or the control function, in certain nec microprocessor products does not infringe on any valid intel copyrights.     intel subsequently filed a suit charging nec with infringing on intel semiconductor copyrights.  reuter &#3;</h3>
