	<h3>consolidated-bathurst inc said three of its quebec newsprint mills have been shut down by strikes which began over the weekend.     the company said about 2,000 workers, members of the canadian paperworkers union and another, independent union, walked out at its wayagamack mill at trois-rivieres, its laurentide mill at grand-mere and its belgo mill at shawinigan.     their contract expired april 30.     the laurentide mill has an annual capacity of 200,000  tonnes, the belgo mill 350,000 tonnes, and the wayagamack mill 70,000 tonnes.     the strikes are the first at consolidated-bathurst mills since an industry-wide walkout in 1976, company spokeswoman denise dallaire said.     "as far as management is concerned, negotiations are going on right now," dallaire said, adding she could not elaborate. union officials were not immediately available for comment. company officials had said at the annual meeting in april they expected no labor problems this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
