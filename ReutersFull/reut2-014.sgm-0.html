	<h3>gold share prices closed mixed to slightly firmer in quiet and cautious trading, showing little reaction to a retreat in the bullion price back to below 420 dlrs and a firmer financial rand, dealers said.     heavyweight vaal reefs ended eight rand higher at 398 rand but grootvlei eased 40 cents at 16.60 rand, while mining financials had gold fields up a rand at 63 rand despite weaker quarterly results. other minings were firm but platinums eased.     industrials also closed mixed to firmer, the index once again hitting a new high of 1757 from friday's 1753 finish. the overall index also hit a new high of 2188 versus 2179 on friday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
