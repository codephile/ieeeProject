	<h3>long-term bank sources confirmed their banks have decided to leave the current 5.2 pct long-term prime rate unchanged.     the current rate has been in effect since march 28.     the bankers said the rate was unchanged because the falling dollar and the bond market rally made it difficult to clarify the current level of yen interest rates.     there had earlier this week been expectations of a 0.2 point cut from today in response to the fall in the secondary market yield in five-year long-term bank debentures, but bankers said last night the rate would be unchanged.  reuter &#3;</h3>
