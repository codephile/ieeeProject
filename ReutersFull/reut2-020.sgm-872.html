	<h3>active japanese investment in u.s. real estate will continue despite a weak dollar because such investments are strong hedges against inflation, financiers and real estate industry experts said.     addressing a conference on japanese investment in u.s. real estate, setsuya tabuchi, chairman of nomura securities co ltd, said japanese investors are extremely cautious about investing in treasury securities because of currency losses suffered in the past during the dollar's sharp decline.     but, he added, "real estate is a hedge against inflation, so such investment will not decline."     japanese total investment in u.s. real estate last year is estimated at around six billion dlrs, exceeding the four billion dlrs ploughed into u.s. equities, arther mitchell of coudert brothers, a u.s. law firm, told the conference.     adding in financing of real estate projects by japanese banks and leasing companies, the total aamount of japanese funds committed to u.s. real estate projects could reach 20 billion dlrs in 1987, he said.    the dollar's fall has made u.s. property cheap, and exchange risks are low because many japanese firms are making investments projected on a dollar/yen rate of 120-130, he said.     panelists at the conference said japanese are now looking at a wider variety of real estate investments, including development projects and suburban buildings.     benjamin lambert, chairman of eastdil realty inc, said the sale of 50 pct of the company to nomura last year was designed to expand its customer base to japan through the securities house's close ties with japanese investors.     participation in mortgage loans is becoming popular among japanese, panelists said. mortgages can be made to disguise active purchases, and years later the loans can be converted into ownership of the property, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
