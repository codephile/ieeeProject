	<h3>directors of the chicago board of trade, cbt, decided at their regular board meeting late yesterday to submit a long-term japanese government bond futures conrtact to the commodity futures trading commission, cftc, for approval.     the cbt's action was made possible by a ruling last week by the securities and exchange commission, sec, which removed a key regulartory obstacle to trading futures on foreign debt securities on u.s. exchanges.     the cbt originally had approved a yen bond futures contract in december 1986 but the sec rule precluded the application.     the application to the cftc could be made as soon as early next week, but the sec's rule change must first be formalized by its publication in the federal register, an cbt spokesman said.     the exchange said it did not know when the yen bond futures contract would be approved the the cftc, but that cftc provisions require that new contract submissions be acted upon within one year after submission.   reuter &#3;</h3>
