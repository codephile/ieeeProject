	<h3>entertainment publications inc said it expects an after-tax loss of 31 cts a share in its third quarter from the disposal of three units it closed.     the company said its board approved a plan to discontinue the operations of three subsidiaries, which are primarily involved in direct mail marketing.     "the discontinued units were not likely to meet the growth and profit goals of the company in the future," entertainment publications said.     the three units lost 900,000 dlrs, or 19 cts a share in the six months ended december 31.  reuter &#3;</h3>
