	<h3>many florida investors are old enough to have seen it all before -- they lived through the crash of '29 and monday's stock market debacle was just another day for some.     "i don't sell," declared one elderly investor, who said he had more than one mln dlrs in stocks. "whatever goes down is bound to come back up."     the uniqueness of south florida investors was easy to see in brokerage offices around miami, where the average age of the crowds watching the big board quotations flash by on tuesday was retirement and beyond.         "i don't know of any demographic studies, but we certainly have the highest number of elderly active investors," said marshall moore, a vice president of amerifirst securities corporation in miami.     he worries that monday's record loss of more than 500 points on the new york stock exchange will scare many people, particularly those on fixed incomes, out of the market forever.     "they will not be in stocks any longer," he said. "when you start getting heart palpitations and sweaty palms you have to get out and stay out except for maybe utilities and some income-oriented issues."         across the state on the gulf coast where there are heavy concentrations of retired persons, robert lee of investment management and research incorporated said there were "a lot of serious losses out there."     retirees account for 90 per cent of his firm's business and could take comfort in the fact that its professional managers took their money out of the market last month. "but for those who were buying in on the recent  upswing, this is devastating," he said.         miami beach broker george fox, most of whose clients are over 60, worries that many are not taking the situation seriously enough. those who depend on their market earnings should be a lot more concerned, he said. "i am scared because i think this could become very serious."     one 93-year-old investor said the market was bound to fall sharply, "i just didn't think it would happen so soon." she remembered '29 and said she remained stingy to this day as a result. "i still find it hard to spend money."  reuter &#3;</h3>
