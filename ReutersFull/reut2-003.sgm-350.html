	<h3>a confidential world bank report on the peruvian economy said the government's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to quickly lead to inflation.     the report, published today by an economic monthly, the peru report, said the success of president alan garcia's government in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct gross domestic product growth "represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long."     government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment programme and greater emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential.     the report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme was encountering increasing difficulties.     "an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable," it added.  &#3;</h3>
