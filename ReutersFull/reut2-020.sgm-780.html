	<h3>bausch and lomb inc said its board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to three mln of its 30.5 mln issued shares of common stock.     the company said recent turmoil in the financial markets has resulted in its stock being priced substantially below a level which it believes to be an accurate reflection of the company's present performance and future earnings potential.     the shares will be repurchased at management's discretion, either in the open market, or by private purchase, and will be used in connection with acquisitions, stock options and employee benefit plans.  reuter &#3;</h3>
