	<h3>silver bullion was fixed at 674.50 cents an ounce, its highest since mid-april 1985, dealers said.     the metal continued to be supported by gold/silver ratio dealing, with traders buying silver and selling gold.     dealers said the market also featured some panic short-covering.     silver moved steadily higher during the morning after opening at 671/674, up from its previous close of 663/665.     three months was fixed at 426.50 pence, up from last night's final 418.50/420.50.  reuter &#3;</h3>
