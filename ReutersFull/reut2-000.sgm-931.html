	<h3>klm royal dutch airlines <klm.a> said it agreed to take a 15 pct stake in air u.k. ltd, a subsidiary of british and commonwealth shipping plc <bcom.l>, in a transaction worth around two mln stg.    a klm spokesman said klm already cooperated closely with air uk, which runs 111 flights a week to amsterdam's schipol airport from nine uk cities.    british and commonwealth shipping said last week it held preliminary talks about a klm minority stake in air u.k. but gave no further details. klm said it hoped the move would attract more british feeder traffic to amsterdam airport.  reuter &#3;</h3>
