	<h3>bethlehem steel corp said it was disappointed by the downgrading of its debentures by standard and poor's investment service.     "we believe their action is inappropriate in view of the stability we are experiencing in the market, the realization of the anticipated improvements in our steel operations, and our current liquidity level," the company said.     it said its position of cash and marketable securities increased to 463 mln dlrs at year-end 1986 from 99 mln dlrs a year earlier. "we expect to maintain an adequate level of liquidity through 1987," it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
