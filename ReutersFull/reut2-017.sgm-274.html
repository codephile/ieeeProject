	<h3>sugar beet plantings are almost complete in southern west germany but are lagging behind in other regions, trade sources said.     in the west of the country, about 60 pct of the plantings were completed, while in the north only 40 pct of the sugar beet area has been sown, they said.     the weather is forecast to stay mild in northern west germany in the coming days and more planting progress is expected there, they said.     this year's area sown to sugar beets is likely to fall to 38,500 hectares from around 40,000 last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
