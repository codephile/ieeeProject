	<h3>president reagan said paul volcker has declined to serve another term as chairman of the federal reserve board, the u.s. central bank. reagan nominated economist alan greenspan in his place.     volcker's term expires in august.     reagan, in a brief announcement in the white house briefing room, said he accepted volcker's decision "with great reluctance and regret."     volcker, first appointed to the fed post by president jimmy carter in 1979, said "there is a time to leave and a time to come ... i have no feeling i was being pushed."     volcker, appearing with reagan, greenspan, and treasury secretary james baker in the briefing room, said he will remain on the job until greenspan's nomination is approved by the senate.     in a tribute to a smiling volcker standing beside him, greenspan told reporters that one of the departing chairman's greatest achievements was reducing inflation.     "it will be up to those of us who follow him to be certain that those very hard won gains will not be lost. assuring that will be one of my primary goals," greenspan said.     financial markets reacted with dismay at the departure of volcker, who has been widely credited with holding the line on inflation and seeking to maintain stability in currency values.     immediately following reagan's announcement, the u.s. dollar weakened sharply against all major currencies and both the bond and stock markets declined.     but greenspan told reporters he thought the dollar, which has fallen sharply over the past year, has reached its low point.         "there certainly is evidence in that direction," greenspan said when reporters asked if the dollar has bottomed out.     the market reaction was probably exaggerated by surprise because the announcement followed a number of published reports that the white house had decided to reappoint volcker.     volcker's tenure at the fed began under the cloud of major inflation under carter with consumer prices rising more than 10 per cent annually and the prime interest rate exceeding 20 per cent.         with reagan's backing, volcker pursued a tight money policy that cut inflation to about three per cent annually and reduced interest rates to their lowest level in nearly a decade.     the tight money policies were also blamed for producing a deep recession in 1981 and 1982 that caused major political problems for reagan.     reagan reappointed volcker to the chairmanship in 1983.         greenspan, who heads his own wall street consulting firm, was chairman of president ford's council of economic advisers from september 1974 until january 1977.     greenspan, a republican, is considered a traditional conservative economist and has been an adviser to several presidents.  reuter &#3;</h3>
