	<h3>prime minister poul schlueter said the downgrading of denmark's credit rating by the u.s. standard and poor's corp was regrettable but of little practical importance.     3tandard and poor's yesterday lowered the rating on danish long-term external debt to aa from aa-plus, saying denmark was less competitive with rising labour costs and this would worsen the external account deficit and increase external debt.     schlueter told journalists after the weekly cabinet meeting: "it is regrettable that they have taken a plus from us, but the change will not have much practical significance."     he was echoing comments by central bank governor erik hoffmeyer, who was quoted by the daily politiken as saying the downgrading would have little effect on denmark's borrowing capability or the interest it paid on loans.     but some bank economists said the lower rating would increase the cost of national borrowing to finance the external current account deficit, which rose to a record 34.5 billion crowns in 1986.     denmark had total foreign debt of over 260 mln crowns at the end of 1986.     finance minister palle simonsen said in a statement last night that the downgrading, the second in four years, should not be over-dramatised, pointing out that the government had already imposed a series of austerity measures to limit consumption and was willing to act again if necessary.     prices fell steeply when the danish bond market opened but recovered somewhat after the central bank cut the overnight money market lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct.     the bank said the cut was due to an inflow of foreign currency in march, following stabler currency relations after january's ems realignment.  reuter &#3;</h3>
