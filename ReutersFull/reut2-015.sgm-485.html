	<h3>japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa said the group of seven (g-7) countries reaffirmed their paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve.     at a news conference after yesterday's g-7 meeting, miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. the speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the paris accord was needed, he said.     he said this test of the g-7 nations' resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable.  reuter &#3;</h3>
