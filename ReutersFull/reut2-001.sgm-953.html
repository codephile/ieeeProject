	<h3>president of the japan chamber of commerce and industry (jcci) noboru gotoh called on the government to issue additional construction bonds as an emergency measure to stimulate domestic demand.     gotoh told a press conference that increased fiscal spending is the only alternative to prop up the economy as credit conditions are easy enough, a jcci spokesman said.     japan faces serious unemployment unless more construction bonds, to raise cash for public works, are issued but japan should continue to carry out fiscal reform programmes, gotoh said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
