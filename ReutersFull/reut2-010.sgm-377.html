	<h3>south africa's inflation rate, currently at 16.3 pct, should decline further during 1987, the reserve bank said in its latest quarterly review.     although the recent fall in inflation was "largely attributable to purely statistical factors," the decline had clearly been aided by a recovery in the rand's exchange rate, the bank said.     "the inflation rate stands to benefit further from the more recent advances in the exchange rate in the third quarter of 1986 and in the first few months of 1987," it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
