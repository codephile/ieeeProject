	<h3>the french government plans new legislation this year which will lower the thresholds at which investors in companies must declare their shareholdings, bourse officials said.     the new rules, part of a scheme to provide more openness in corporate ownership structure, will lower the initial declaration threshold to five pct of a company's capital.     under current rules, an investor has to notify the bourse supervisory commission when a holding exceeds 10 pct, and again at 33 pct and 50 pct. the officials said a 20 pct level has also been added to the scale.  reuter &#3;</h3>
