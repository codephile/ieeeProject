	<h3>orion royal bank has decided to withdraw from making markets in floating rate notes (frns), an official of orion said.     he said the decision to withdraw was made about 11 days ago before the market was battered by a loss of confidence, which resulted in sizeable losses in these securities.     the official, who declined to be identified, said orion, the merchant banking arm of royal bank of canada, had operated profitably in the market from 1984 to date. however, the decline in the market made it appear that they could no longer justify the overhead.     the official said orion would redeploy the three traders who had been in the frn sector, mostly to their euro-commercial paper operation, an area the bank believes has a greater growth potential.     officials at several other firms, who also declined to be identified, said they were reviewing their position to decide whether to continue making markets in frns.     in trading earlier today, traders said prices of several dated frns had firmed slightly and that some buyers were beginning to re-enter the market.  reuter &#3;</h3>
