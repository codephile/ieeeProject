	<h3>singapore will have an inflation rate of one pct in 1987, up from a negative 1.4 pct in 1986, trade and industry minister lee hsien loong told parliament.     he said the 1986 drop in the inflation rate, the first fall in a decade, was due largely to lower world prices for oil and oil-related items.     but lee said the negative inflation rate is unlikely to be repeated this year because of projected higher prices for primary commodities and oil.  reuter &#3;</h3>
