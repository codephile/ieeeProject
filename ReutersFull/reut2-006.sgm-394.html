	<h3>talks are underway between financially troubled zaire and the international monetary fund (imf) aimed at rescuing the economy of the second largest nation in sub-saharan africa.     diplomatic and banking sources in kinshasa agreed that a compromise formula could be reached in the coming weeks enabling pro-western zaire to obtain a much needed injection of cash.     for its part the government is expected to increase budgetary discipline, which in turn is likely to attract foreign investors, the sources said.     "barring last-ditch obstacles, which can't be totally ruled out in an issue involving a nation's pride and substantial political and economic interests, zaire and its creditors are bound to come to terms soon," a western diplomat told reuters.     "the zairean economy won't survive without massive imf assistance. similarily, the west has no interest to see zaire's strategic minerals fall into communist hands," the diplomat said.     zaire defied its creditors late last year by saying it would limit repayments on its five billion dlr external debt to 10 pct of its export earnings from january 1987.     the government also announced an end to the floating exchange rate for the zaire currency and a return to a fixed parity against special drawing rights (sdrs) with periodic adjustments.     until last year, zaire devoted up to 28 pct of its export revenue to servicing large foreign debts contracted during the copper boom of the 1970's to finance largely non-productive and often extravagant investment projects.     zaire, the world's leading cobalt producer and the sixth largest supplier of copper, depends on the two minerals for two-thirds of its export earnings.     "a young country cannot go on indefinitely sacrificing everything for the sake of servicing its external debt," president mobutu sese seko commented in october when he announced his government's decision.     as early as january 1986, mobutu had warned that "one does not feed on austerity and praise. i have another debt, one toward my people and my people's efforts must not backfire," he told diplomats.     zaire pointed out that during four years of imf-backed austerity (1983-86), it had become a net exporter of capital without receiving appropriate financing from abroad.     economists said that since the large devaluation of the zaire currency in september 1983, the country suffered a net outflow of 830 mln dlrs each year.     zaire's medium and long term public debt in the past few years reached an equivalent of about 100 pct of its gross national product (gnp), one of the highest such ratios in the world, banking sources said.     mobutu accused the imf of "strangling" his country at an october meeting of the ruling mpr party and said his people could not long endure the hardship caused by austerity.     zairean officials blame their present difficulties on the imf recovery plan's two basic assumptions which, they said, failed to materialise last year,     - a world economic recovery pushing up commodity prices and boosting zaire's export revenue and debt servicing capacity,     - substantial, additional financial help from the country's traditional donors.     in 1983 zaire set out on a major economic reform aimed at curbing its soaring debt. it floated its currency, slashed spending and privatised industry, gaining praise from western creditors and obtaining debt rescheduling.     as a result, the overall economic and financial situation improved markedly, with inflation down to 41 pct last year from 100 pct in 1983.     but it also led to a severe and steady fall in living standards for zaire's 35 mln population, fuelling widespread discontent among poorer city dwellers, diplomats said.     economists estimate the drop in purchasing power at between 20 and 35 pct for an average household over the last 12 months, despite a pay rise of up to 67 pct for civil servants announced last may.     the world bank has released in the last two months half of a previously-agreed 80 mln dlrs industrial sector loan and lent 27.6 mln dlrs to modernise the country's vital river transport system.     belgium, zaire's former colonial ruler and its main trading partner, recently agreed to release a total of 17 mln dlrs to ease payments difficulties and finance imports of spare parts for industry.     a new agreement between the imf and zaire would pave the way for another debt rescheduling, probably at the next meeting of the paris club of western creditor nations, diplomats said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
