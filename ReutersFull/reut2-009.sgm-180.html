	<h3>nippon steel corp <nstc.t> plans to reduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending march 31 1987 from the five yen of 1985/86, a company spokesman said.     the company estimated parent company current losses at 15 billion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen from the sale of securities. this compares with a 36.07 billion yen profit a year earlier.     sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2,150 billion yen, down from 2,685 billion a year ago.     poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise and slow world steel demand. nippon is expected to report parent company results in late may.     total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57 mln tonnes, down from 27.98 mln a year earlier.     crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 output but forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting april 1 are unavailable yet, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
