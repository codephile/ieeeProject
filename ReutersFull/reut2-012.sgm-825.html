	<h3>the finance ministry has proposed a change in rules affecting ownership of commercial banks by non-banking financial groups, a ministry statement said.     the proposals aim to block loopholes open to financial groups with banking subsidiaries. according to current rules these groups are not bound by the same regulations prevailing in the traditional banking sector.     the finance ministry proposals follow a recent bid by the proventus financial group to create a new holding company that would control the third-largest commercial bank gotabanken and wermlandsbanken, a small regional bank.     the proposal suggests that a holding company with a banking unit must be subject to the same rules which currently apply to the commercial banking operations, the finance ministry said in a statement.     it added that july 1 this year was the proposed date of implementation for the measures, which will almost certainly be rubber-stamped by parliament.  reuter &#3;</h3>
