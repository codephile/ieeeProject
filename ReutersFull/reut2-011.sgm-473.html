	<h3>hercules inc and collagen corp said they formed an equally-owned joint venture to develop, make and market products for the treatment of dermal wounds caused by surgery, trauma or disease.     the joint venture will focus on development of products to heal dermal wounds that are resistant to currently available treatment, the companies said.     they said clinical studies will focus initially on treating wounds such as decubitus ulcers or bedsores caused by prolonged pressure and underlying diseases such as diabetes, which compromises the blood supply.  reuter &#3;</h3>
