	<h3>mannesmann ag <mmwg.f> expects a difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief executive werner dieter told a news conference.     dieter said west german producers would see a downturn in foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer nations.     domestic business was also declining and orders for west german engineering goods have been falling since july 1986, dieter said.     mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.     dieter said mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started last year, were now having an effect.     dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products accounted for less than 30 pct of mannesmann's turnover. the company saw good chances in the automation sector, which dieter said had become one of mannesmann's "strategic aims."     he said the company's drive to combine activities in mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "plus point" for mannesmann.     mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take a majority stake in the fichtel und sachs ag car parts group for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. its world group net profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.     it has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar and lack of demand for steel pipe.     dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
