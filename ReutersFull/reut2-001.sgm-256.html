	<h3>french exporters estimated that around 600,000 tonnes of french soft wheat has been sold to china for delivery in the 1986/87 (july/june) year.     around 300,000 tonnes were exported to china between july 1986 and february this year.     another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped during this month and around the same amount in april, they said.     france sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to china in 1985/86, according to customs figures.     however, certain exporters fear china may renounce part of its contract with france after being offered one mln tonnes of u.s. soft wheat under the export enhancement program in january and making some purchases under the initiative.  reuter &#3;</h3>
