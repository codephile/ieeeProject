	<h3>genzyme corp said the u.s. patent office has approved a patent for the company's method of testing for serum alpha amylase, an indicator of pancreatic disease.     "the patent strengthens genzyme's proprietary position as the leading independent supplier of diagnostic enzymes and substrates," henri temeer, genzyme president, said.     the company said the technology combines a unique substrate with two indicator enzymes in a diagnostic assay to measure serum amylase levels.     genzyme said that since 1985 it has entered into several licensing agreements for the technology with amylase test kit makers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
