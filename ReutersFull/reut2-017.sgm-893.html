	<h3>malaysian rubber production should return to normal levels this month after a hard wintering season, the malaysian rubber exchange and licensing board said in its latest review. "as packers and remillers expect production to recover to normal levels in june, sellers will remain reserved in the near future," the review, dated may 14, said. many consumers are holding off, waiting for the best time to buy.     the market is mindful of approaching summer holidays in industrial countries and there is an air of uncertainty beyond july, it said. it gave no figures for the output drop.  reuter &#3;</h3>
