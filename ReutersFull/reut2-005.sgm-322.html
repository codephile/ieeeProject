	<h3>gold is expected to continue its rise this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in the u.s., hamburg-based vereins- und westbank ag said.     it said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil prices and the organisation of petroleum exporting countries' efforts to achieve further firming of the price has led to growing inflationary pressures in the u.s.     money supplies in the u.s., japan and west germany exceed central bank limits and real growth of their gross national products, it added.     use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank said.     speculative demand, which influences the gold price on futures markets, has also risen, the bank said.     these factors and south africa's unstable political situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country, underscore the firmer sentiment, it said.     however, australia's output is estimated to rise to 90 tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
