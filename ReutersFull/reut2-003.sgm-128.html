	<h3>norcros <ncro.l> plc said it has no intention of proceeding any further with talks on williams holdings plc's suggestion that there would be benefits arising from a merger between the two groups.     norcros said any such benefits could be achieved through normal trading and did not warrant a closer formal association.     norcros shares firmed 30p to 342p after the news on investor speculation of a possible hostile bid from williams, dealers said. williams rose 2p to 742.     williams earlier informed norcros that it holds some 2,890,000 of its ordinary shares or 2.2 pct of those issued.  reuter &#3;</h3>
