	<h3>live cattle futures were expected to continue their upward climb to new season's highs and highest levels in years as fundamentals continue to point upward, traders said.     they cited steady to higher live calls as the main buying factor. market-ready supplies remain tight and packer interest has been improving, they noted.     a firm tone to cash wholesale beef and moderate boxed beef movement at higher cutout prices were also cited as supporting factors. stopping of deliveries by strong hands will likely add to strength in spot april, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
