	<h3>barnett banks inc and home federal bank of florida said they filed a suit against the federal home loan bank board and the federal savings and loan insurance corp.     the companies said the suit asks a jacksonville, fla., federal district court to enjoin the enforcement of an interpretive rule adopted by the fhlbb last year which seeks to give it jurisdiction over barnett's proposed acquisition of home.     the suit says this rule is arbitrary and capricious.  reuter &#3;</h3>
