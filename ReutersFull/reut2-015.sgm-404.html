	<h3>british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe and u.s. secretary of state george shultz plan to discuss the growing crisis in trade relations with japan in talks in washington, government officials said.     howe views the apparent deadlock in british attempts to secure a greater share in japanese domestic markets very seriously, said an official travelling with him.     britain has threatened to impose retaliatory restrictions on japanese finance houses in london if japan does not open up its markets. the u.s. has already imposed higher tariffs on computer microchips imported from japan.     michael howard, the british minister for consumer and corporate affairs, repeated the threat of sanctions before leaving tokyo yesterday at the end of a four-day visit during which he failed to secure major concessions from the japanese.     howe's main mission in washington was to brief shultz on prime minister margaret thatcher's visit to the soviet union last week. shultz is due to fly to moscow next week.  reuter &#3;</h3>
