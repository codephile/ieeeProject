	<h3>west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg suggested that the u.k. should join the european monetary system (ems) and also urged some member countries to abandon their dual currency structures.     stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of the committee for a currency union in europe, whose key members are former west german chancellor helmut schmidt and former french president valery giscard d'estaing, founders of the ems.     he said, "one failing of the ems is important countries, like great britain, are not members. other partners should give up their split currencies or abandon broader fluctuations."     ems member belgium has both a "financial" and a "commercial" franc and the italian lira is allowed to fluctuate by six pct against other member currencies, compared with a permitted fluctuation of only 2.25 pct for other currencies.     according to a text of stoltenberg's speech, the finance minister also urged greater convergence of economic and financial policies among european countries.     he added that monetary stability should be a priority for european countries and, with reference to the u.s. dollar, he said it was wrong to presume that a "permanent devaluation" was the answer to economic problems.     stoltenberg said there were clear reasons to bring down the dollar in 1985. "but an overshooting in the other direction now brings the danger of a new inflationary push for the u.s. and other countries whose currencies have declined," he added.     he said such a development could also produce further burdens for heavily indebted developing countries. an agreement last month in paris by industrial countries to stabilise the dollar around current levels had acknowledged these risks, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
