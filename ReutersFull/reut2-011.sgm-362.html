	<h3>the dutch finance ministry said it is discussing with foreign fiscal authorities, primarily west german and belgian, possible means to combat evasion of tax on interest payments received abroad.     finance minister onno ruding told parliament yesterday he aimed in 1988 to recoup about 100 mln guilders in tax revenue on interest income both at home and abroad, and a further 300 mln by the end of 1990.     he expected dutch banks soon to start automatically reporting interest payments they make, but this could prompt more investors to open foreign accounts, ruding said.     there are no restrictions on dutch capital flows, and the ministry was therefore seeking co-operation from fiscal authorities abroad to monitor interest paid on accounts held by dutch citizens, said spokesman jaap weeda.     ruding was largely motivated by guidelines laid down in the centre-right government's policy plan which calls for the ministry to boost its income by one billion guilders by 1990.     weeda said it was difficult to estimate taxation lost through undeclared interest income, but ministry figures indicated that about 20 pct of such income was not declared.     ruding told parliament dutch banks seemed willing to co-operate in plans to report on interest payments, but they foresaw practical problems.     there was no firm target date for introducing reporting procedures, but ruding was adamant it must happen soon.     "i cannot and will not accept any delay," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
