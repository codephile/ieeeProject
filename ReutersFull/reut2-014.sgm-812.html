	<h3>yen bond futures prices hit record highs in early trade in response to the early jump in the cash bond market on speculative purchases by brokers, dealers said.     key june was 111.31 after hitting a record high earlier of 111.48, against an opening of 111.02. it closed at 110.68 yesterday. september was 110.10, below the earlier record of 110.15 and against a 109.40 close.     the rally was triggered by a fall in short-term interest rates and heavy broker speculation in expectation of more end-investor purchases. but prices eased towards end-morning as the cash bond market fell on profit taking, dealers said.     the yen unconditional call rate was 3.5000 pct today, down from 3.6250 pct yesterday.     the bank of japan sold a total of 800 billion yen worth of financial bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 1,300 billion yen due to allocation of government revenues to local governments and public entities and the return of bank notes.     dealers were divided about whether expectations of another discount rate cut have been built into the market. some dealers said it is too early for the market to discount a rate cut and projected a possible sudden market retreat.  reuter &#3;</h3>
