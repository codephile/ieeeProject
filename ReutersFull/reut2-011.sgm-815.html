	<h3>singapore's united industrial corp ltd (uic) has agreed in principle to inject 16 mln dlrs in convertible loan stock into <teck hock and co (pte) ltd>, a creditor bank official said.     uic is likely to take a controlling stake in the troubled international coffee trading firm, but plans are not finalised and negotiations will continue for another two weeks, he said.     teck hock's nine creditor banks have agreed to extend the company's loan repayment period for 10 years although a percentage of the new capital injection will be used to pay off part of the debt.     teck hock owes more than 100 mln singapore dlrs and since last december the banks have been allowing the company to postpone loan repayments while they try to find an investor.     the nine banks are oversea-chinese banking corp ltd, united overseas bank ltd, banque paribas, bangkok bank ltd, citibank n.a., standard chartered bank ltd, algemene bank nederland nv, banque nationale de paris and chase manhattan bank na.  reuter &#3;</h3>
