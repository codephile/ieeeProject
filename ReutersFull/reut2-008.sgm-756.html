	<h3>the gold mining industry had another "exceptional year" in 1986 with tonnage milled, revenues and profits reaching high levels, the chamber of mines said.     nearly 108 mln tons of ore was milled, three pct higher than the prior year, while revenues rose 17 pct to 16.5 billion rand and profits increased 6.5 pct to 8.31 billion rand, the chamber reported.     the profit rise was achieved despite substantial cost increases and a 26.1 pct rise in capital expenditures to 2.42 billion rand, it said.     the chamber said that a "comparatively buoyant gold price allowed mines to continue the practise of mining lower grade ores which has characterised recent years."     it said the industry now mines to an average grade of 5.63 grams per ton compared with 6.09 grams per ton in 1985.     gold output for the year declined five pct to 638 tons compared with the previous year's 671 tons.  reuter &#3;</h3>
