	<h3>senate banking committee chairman william proxmire said modified legislation to help a federal deposit insurance fund and prohibit new limited-service banks and thrifts could be ready for a senate vote in two to three weeks.     proxmire said he agreed to demands from committee members for a one-year moratorium on granting new business powers sought by commercial banks to increase the bill's chances.     in its new form, the bill would proscribe regulators from granting new powers to banks, proxmire told reporters after a speech to the u.s. league of savings institutions.     a vote on the bill by the committee is scheduled for thursday. if approved it will go to the full senate.     "i have spoken to the majority leader and he has agreed to bring it up promptly on the senate floor in two or three weeks," proxmire told the thrift executives.     the bill would recapitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corp fund with 7.5 billion dlrs.     it also would prohibit establishment of new nonbank banks and nonthrift thrifts, so-called because they provide financial services but do not meet the regulatory definition of both making loans and receiving deposits.  reuter &#3;</h3>
