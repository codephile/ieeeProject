	<h3>a 100 mln dlr equity warrant bond for intec inc <intt.t> of japan has been cancelled because of turbulent market activity following today's 14.9 pct plunge in tokyo stock prices, nikko securities co (europe) ltd said as lead manager.     the five year issue, on launched october 13, had terms fixed yesterday, when it last traded at a bid only price of less 2-1/4 pct, placing it on total fees, nikko officials said.     indeed, dealers said stock price volatility shut down trading altogether in japanese equity related debt issues today and cast doubt on the new issue calendar for the next few weeks, during which as many as eight new deals were to be launched.  reuter &#3;</h3>
