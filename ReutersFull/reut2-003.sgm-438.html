	<h3>japan's finance ministry auctioned 1,000 billion yen worth of tankoku, six month debt-financing paper, to roll over previously issued tankoku maturing on march 19, a spokesman said.     the last tankoku auction, on february 12, produced a record low yield of 3.383 pct, reflecting expectation of a half point cut in japan's discount rate, he said.     in the previous auction for 1,000 billion yen, four major japanese securities houses took 92 pct of the issue amount in an attempt to meet strong demand from large institutional investors, securities managers said.     securities managers said they expect the auction to go well again this time as securities houses will try to expand their inventories of tankoku on continuing good response from institutional investors.     contrary to a projected low yield on tankoku, short-term interest rates have been resisting a fall on growing demand for funds ahead of the march 31 financial year-end, they said.     the bank of japan has been trying to dampen money market rates to make the latest discount rate cut effective, but so far in vain, dealers said.     the auction results will be announced tomorrow.  reuter &#3;</h3>
