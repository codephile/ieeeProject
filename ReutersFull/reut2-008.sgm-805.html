	<h3><berliner bank ag> has suffered losses of between 25 mln and 30 mln marks on credits extended by its stuttgart branch by bank officials who exceeded their powers, a bank spokesman said.     the spokesman, replying to queries about press reports, said he could not rule out the possibility that the final loss figure may be slightly above this range.     late last week the bank said only that the losses from the credits in stuttgart would be in the "double-digit millions."  reuter &#3;</h3>
