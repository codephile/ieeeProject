	<h3>santos ltd <stos.s> said it had made a significant oil discovery at its mawson one well in the moomba block of the cooper basin, south australia.     it said the well flowed oil from sands at an average rate of 1,440 barrels per day from 2,131 to 2,135 metres through a 6mm choke.     santos said the well was cased and suspended pending further evaluation. but it said the proximity of the discovery to existing production facilities at the gidgealpa south field would allow mawson one to be brought into production rapidly.     santos has a 60 pct stake in the block, <delhi petroleum pty ltd> has 30 pct and <south australian oil and gas corp pty ltd> has 10 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
