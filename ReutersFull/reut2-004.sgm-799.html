	<h3>citicorp denied financial market rumors that it has written off some of its loans to latin american debtors,     "rumors that we have written off any of our latin american debt are unfounded," a citicorp spokesman told reuters in response to london-based rumors in the money markets.     citicorp is the largest bank group in the u.s. and one of the biggest lenders to latin america, with some eight to nine billion dlrs outstanding to brazil, mexico and argentina, bank analysts said.     in response to more specific market rumors that it had taken action on its exposure to brazil, citicorp said it made an 8-k filing on the subject with the securities and exchange commission on tuesday in relation to a registration statement for a preferred stock issue.     citing the filing, citicorp said that brazil's recent suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt and related actions "may require citicorp to place 3.9 billion dlrs of intermediate and long-term brazilian loans on a cash basis."     when loans are placed on a cash basis, interest or principal payments are only booked when received instead of being accrued on their due dates, analysts noted.     however, citicorp said in the 8-k filing that "it is premature to make such a decision at this time in view of the fluidity of the situation and management's high confidence in the long-term outlook for brazil."     brazil's new central bank governor francisco gros met senior commercial bankers here on wednesday and citicorp said formal talks on brazil's recent actions and future financing needs should begin in "the near future".     citicorp said in the filing, "the issue will be re-evaluated at the end of the first quarter."     the bank group continued, "if it is decided that these loans to brazil should be placed on a cash basis, citicorp estimates, based on existing interest rates, that the impact in the first quarter would be approximately 50 mln dlrs after tax and for the full year would be approximately 190 mln dlrs after tax."     it added that these amounts include interest accrued in 1986 that has not yet been collected.     although citicorp denied earlier rumors of major loan writedowns, its warning that it may have to place some of its brazilian loans on non-accrual unnerved many wall street investors.     the common stock price was down one dlr to 51-1/8 after the first hour on a volume of over 500,000 shares.     however, lawrence cohn, analyst at merrill lynch and co inc, said that the market's nervousness was not really warranted.     "citicorp can afford it," he said. "the amounts they are talking about are peanuts." reuter...^m &#3;</h3>
