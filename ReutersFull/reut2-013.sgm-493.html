	<h3>economy undersecretary yannos papantoniou said the greek economy was responding well to a two-year government austerity program.     he told reporters the evidence for this was in last year's figures, which showed a drop in inflation from 25 pct to 16.9 and a reduction in the current account deficit from 3.3 billion dlrs to 1.7 billion.     papantoniou said indications were encouraging that a target of 1o pct inflation and a deficit of 1.25 billion dlrs would be reached by the end of 1987.     he predicted a "mild" recovery for the greek economy in 1988 and said the government might be able to ease its tough incomes policy, which has virtually frozen wages, and allow some increases related to productivity.     the austerity program, started by prime minister andreas papandreou's socialist government in october 1985, resulted in a wave of strikes late last year and more industrial action is planned by trade unions and workers in coming months.  reuter &#3;</h3>
