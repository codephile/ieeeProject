	<h3>the federal reserve will enter the government securities market to supply reserves via either a large round of customer repurchase agreements or by overnight or possibly four-day system repurchases, economists said.     they said the fed has a fairly large add need and is likely to face the most reserve dislocations early in the new statement period started today as corporate tax payments swell treasury balances at the fed.     fed funds hovered at 6-3/4 pct after averaging 6.80 pct yesterday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
