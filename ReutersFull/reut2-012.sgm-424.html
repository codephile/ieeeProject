	<h3>two days of talks between management and unions to try to end the 3-1/2 month labour dispute at cargill u.k. ltd's oilseed crushing plant at seaforth ended yesterday without resolving the situation, a company spokesman said.     fresh talks are expected to be held early next week but the actual date has not yet been fixed, he added.     oilseed processing at the mill has been at a standstill since december 19 and the company has declared force majeure for deliveries of soymeal and soyoil ahead to may.  reuter &#3;</h3>
