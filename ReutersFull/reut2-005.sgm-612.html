	<h3>moody's investors service inc said it raised to aa-2 from aa-3 the long-term deposit obligations of citizens fidelity bank and trust co because its parent, citizens fidelity corp, has merged into pnc financial corp.     moody's said the merger should strengthen the bank's earnings potential through the acquired access to pnc's product lines. it should also result in significantly more financial flexibility to citizens fidelity, moody's said.     the bank's prime-1 rating for short-term deposits was not affected.  reuter &#3;</h3>
