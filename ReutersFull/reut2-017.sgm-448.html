"this is in line with the government's policy to limit our trade surplus with the united states to help reduce trade friction between the two countries," the official said.     south korea's trade surplus with the u.s. rose to 7.3 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion in 1985. officials said the surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but seoul would try to hold it below eight billion dlrs.     the finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later this month on a further 53 items, including acrylic yarn and ethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to check inflation.     the officials said the tariff cuts would contribute to holding wholesale and consumer price rises at less than three pct this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
