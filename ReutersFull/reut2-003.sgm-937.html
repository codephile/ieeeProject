	<h3>two u.s. government agencies are in dispute over a proposal for u.s. firms to sell computers to iran, officials said.     the commerce department said it intends to approve export licenses for two firms to sell computers and related equipment to the islamic republic of iran news agency and the iran power generation transmission, spokesman b. jay cooper said.     the export companies were not identified, but the sales included computers made by digital equipment co <dec> of maynard, mass.     high-technology exports must be approved by the departments of commerce, defense and state.     the pentagon will appeal commerce's approval of the sales because the technology could be turned against u.s. national security, commander bob prucha, a pentagon spokesman, said.     the pentagon will ask the national security council in the white house to prohibit the sales.     cooper said the state department did not object to the sales, but secretary of state george shultz indicated he may weigh in against the deal.     under questioning by rep. jack kemp (r-ny) at a hearing, shultz said he was unaware that the commerce department was preparing to grant export licenses for the sale of computers.     "i'm not in favor of sales to iran" of advanced u.s. technology, shultz said.     the commerce department has argued that excessive restrictions hurt u.s. companies that compete with foreign exporters.     cooper said the technology in the iranian sales was available elsewhere and that foreign companies would get the iran business if the u.s. export licenses were not approved.  reuter &#3;</h3>
