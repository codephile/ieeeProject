	<h3>a counter-proposal from creditor banks to argentina's request for rescheduling its 50 billion dlr foreign debt was faulty, an argentine observer at negotiations said.     "the negotiations are not going to prosper if (the creditor banks) do not change the counter-proposal put to argentina, as it is a swiss cheese full of holes," ruling radical party deputy raul baglini said.     baglini, who was recently observing negotiations with the steering committee for argentina's creditor banks in new york, spoke to reporters in mendoza, 600 miles west of buenos aires.     baglini said the counter-proposal did not take into account argentina's request for a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet four pct growth targets in 1987.     he said the steering committee wanted only to discuss some aspects of the request, while argentina's negotiators were laying emphasis on a global pacakge.     the united states said last week it would back a 500 mln dlr bridge loan to argentina.  reuter &#3;</h3>
