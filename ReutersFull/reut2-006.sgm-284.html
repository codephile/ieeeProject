	<h3>brazilian planning minister joao sayad resigned, a presidential spokesman said.     his resignation was accepted during a meeting with  president jose sarney this afternoon, the spokesman said.     no official reasons for the resignation were immediately available, but sources close to the government said sayad had pressed for a three-month price freeze and sharp government spending cuts to combat inflation.     neither sarney nor finance minister dilson funaro accepted the proposals, the sources said.     sayad was one of the architects of last year's "plano cruzado" program, which froze prices, ended widespread indexation of the economy and introduced the new cruzado currency to replace the cruzeiro in a bid to cut the 250 pct annual inflation rate.     after holding prices for nearly nine months, the plan was unable to withstand the inflationary pressures of booming consumer demand and widespread shortages. in the first two months of this year prices rose by around 30 per cent.     a sharp deterioration in brazil's foreign trade surplus caused president sarney to announce last month the suspension of interest rate payments on 68 billion dollars of commercial debt.     finance minister funaro told reporters last week new measures to correct the economy would be announced within a month, although he gave no further details.     earlier today u.s. treasury secretary james baker said  brazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes to get additional assistance from commercial banks and others.     sayad's resignation might foreshadow other changes in the brazilian cabinet.     presidential spokesman frota netto told journalists earlier today the government was considering a suggestion by the chief of civilian staff at the presidency marco maciel that a new multi-party cabinet be formed to deal with the country's current economic difficulties.  reuter &#3;</h3>
