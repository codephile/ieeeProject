	<h3>the latest british opinion poll, gave margaret thatcher's conservatives a 17-point lead over the opposition -- the highest rating yet for the prime minister who is seeking a record third consecutive term.     the poll in today's sun tabloid showed the conservatives could win a majority of 125 seats in parliament in the next general elections. thatcher must call the elections by june 1988, but is expected to do so this year. the survey, conducted between april 10 and 12 among 1,000 adults eligible to vote, gave the conservatives 44 pct, and left-wing labour and the centrist liberal-social democratic alliance 27 pct each. &#3;</h3>
