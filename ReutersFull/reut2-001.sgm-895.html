	<h3>president reagan said improper record keeping of meetings and decisions made on the iran arms initiative led to his failure to recollect whether he approved arms shipments by israel before or after the fact.     in a televised address to the american people reagan said he is still upset that no-one kept proper records -- a complaint made by the tower commission.     the arms shipment was made in august of 1985 by israel.     "i did approve it; i just can't specifically say when," reagan said.     reagan added: "rest assured, there's plenty of record-keeping now going on at 1600 pennsylvania avenue (the white house)."     the timing of reagan's approval of the israeli shipment is important because it could determine whether the sale violated various laws, including the arms export control act.  reuter &#3;</h3>
