	<h3>u.s. house speaker jim wright said he would question president reagan tomorrow about his plan to protect kuwaiti oil tankers with u.s. warships from attacks by iran in the gulf.     house and senate democrats, who control congress, have been critical of reagan's plan but have not decided how or if they should try to pass legislation to prohibit it.     wright, a texas democrat, told reporters the administration had gone ahead with plans to reflag the kuwaiti tankers as u.s. ships without asking congressional leaders for their advice.  reuter &#3;</h3>
