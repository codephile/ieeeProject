	<h3>atcor inc said the magnitude of any earnings recovery in fiscal 1987 depends on the direction of steel pricing and how fast the company's severe operating problems in its consumer segment are resolved.     atcor's consumer segment represents about 25 pct of its sales. in a letter to shareholders the company said that that part of its business continues to be unprofitable.     atcor said it does not expect performance improvements in the first quarter to be sustained throughout the year due to increasing raw material costs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
