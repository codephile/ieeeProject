	<h3>senator kent conrad, d-nd, said president reagan's goal of phasing-out world farm subsidies by the year 2000 is doomed to failure because the european community, ec, will not accept it.     "it (reagan plan) is a nonstarter. its absolutely crystal clear they (ec) have no intention of eliminating subsidies," said conrad on his return from a four-day visit to europe.     instead of proposing an end to farm subsidies, he said the u.s. should adopt some of the ec common agricultural policy, cap, principles by seeking a "compromise" agreement with brussels to jointly reduce production, and apply a two-price system of high domestic and low export prices. under the plan, export subsidies would bridge domestic and world price gaps, said conrad, a new member of the senate agriculture committee.  reuter &#3;</h3>
