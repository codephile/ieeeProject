	<h3>the finnish metal and mining group outokumpu oy said it will close its nickel refinery at harjavalta in central finland for six weeks in july and august this year due to current low prices on the nickel market.     "we consider nickel prices as bad at the moment, although they have been rising slightly since january," refinery sales manager pekka purra said.     he said the closure will mean a drop in production of 3,000 tonnes in 1987 from last year's output of 17,800 tonnes. the closure was also a move to cut labour costs as no extra staff have to be employed during holidays to keep the plant open.  reuter &#3;</h3>
