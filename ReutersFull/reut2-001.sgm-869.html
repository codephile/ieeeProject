	<h3>the philippines and its bank advisory committee completed a second day of talks on the country's request to reschedule 9.4 billion dlrs of debts, bankers said.     they declined to disclose details of the negotiations, but said it would be unrealistic to expect an outcome until next week at the earliest.     talks with argentina over 2.15 billion dlrs of new loans and a multi-year rescheduling also continued in new york, with the citibank-led advisory committee making a counter-proposal to argentina's original offer. bankers remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached by the middle of the month.  reuter &#3;</h3>
