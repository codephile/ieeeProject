	<h3>moody's investors service inc said it downgraded niagara mohawk power corp's 2.2 billion dlrs of debt securities and preferred stock.     moody's cited cost increases at the utility's nine mile nuclear unit 2 and an unfavorable rate decision by the new york public service commission.     cut were the company's first mortgage bonds and secured pollution control issues to baa-2 from baa-1, and eurobonds, unsecured pollution control debt, unsecured medium-term notes and preferred stock to baa-3 from baa-2. niagara mohawk's prime-2 commercial paper was left unchanged.     moody's said the rate decision last month by the public service commission would significantly pressure niagara mohawk's coverage of fixed charges.     moreover, cost increases associated with the in-service delay of the 41 pct owned nine mile unit 2 from september 1987 to early 1988, along with prospective delays, are unlikely to be recovered under the cost-settlement agreement for the nuclear unit, moody's noted.     the potential write-off would sharply reduce niagara mohawk's common equity and may impair financial flexibility, the agency said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
