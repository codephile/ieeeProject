	<h3>technimed corp said it has completed development of a home cholesterol testing product and will start clinical testing of its whole blood cholesterol test strip shortly.     the company said the strip is inexpensive and is simpler than lab tests now being used.  a drop of blood is applied to the strip and within about 30 seconds a simple color change allows the user to determine his own cholesterol level.     it said it expects to be the first to market a home cholesterol test and the test should contribute substantially to future earnings.   reuter &#3;</h3>
