	<h3>texton inc said it intends to repay a substantial portion of the debt generated to acquire ex-cell-o corp last year through internally generated cash and proceeds from the sale of assets.     textron financed the acquisition by borrowing about one billion dlrs under promissory notes, subsequently refinanced through the sale of commercial paper and bank borrowings.     the large diversified conglomerate with operations ranging from defense to consumer and financial services, said in its annual report that it has not yet identified the units, other than its gorham division, it expects to sell.     textron said it did expect to identify the units it intends to sell during the next year. it said the sales are expected to reduce income from continuing operations as the units' earnings will exceed the interest on the debt retired with the proceeds of the sales.     it also said it plans to "return to a more conservative balance sheet ratio of debt-to-capital," through asset sales and increasing cash flow from continuing operations.     it also said it will continue to examine "large acquisition opportunities," while "pruning" operations no longer expected to meet its strategic requirements.  reuter &#3;</h3>
