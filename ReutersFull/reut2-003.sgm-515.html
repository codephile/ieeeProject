	<h3>borrowing on the international capital markets rose moderately in february with 25.9 billion dlrs of medium and long term funds raised, up 1.5 billion from january and up 3.2 billion from february last year, the organisation for economic cooperation and development, oecd, said.     borrowing on external bond markets totalled 20.8 billion dlrs, some 2.8 billion more than in january, the oecd said in its latest monthly report.     but the market for floating rate notes (frns) saw further serious difficulties and the volume of new offerings was only 1.4 billion dlrs against a 1986 monthly average of 4.2 billion.     however, the oecd said, issues of straight bonds and especially equity-related issues continued at a brisk pace.     as in january, exchange rate uncertainties had a major impact on the currency composition of new bond issues, with issues in dlrs totalling only 6.5 billion against a monthly average of over 10 billion dlrs in 1986.     "the share of the u.s. dollar in total external bond offerings has fallen below 32 pct this year - the lowest figure in the present decade," the report said, but added that the market has absorbed a record volume of yen offerings.     in the syndicated credit market, the volume of new loans declined to 3.9 billion dlrs in february from 4.7 billion in january. activity on the market for note issuance and other back-up facilities continued to be particularly subdued with a total of only 1.2 billion dlrs completed in february, some 500 mln dlrs less than the already depressed figure for january.     in february, oecd borrowers accounted for some 85 pct of total borrowing with major borrowers including the u.s. with 4.5 billion dlrs, japan, 3.1 billion, and france with two billion, in addition to a one billion dlr refinancing for electricity board edf.  reuter &#3;</h3>
