	<h3>japanese securities houses and banks are eager to enter the market for lead-management of mark eurobonds when the ban on japanese institutions is lifted, but the entry may be difficult, japanese bankers said.     most japanese securities houses and banks established here said they have concrete plans to enter lead-management business, as soon as terms are cleared, probably this year.     japan's largest bank, the dai-ichi kangyo bank ltd, is also considering expanding its business here, bankers said.     japanese banks were excluded from lead management of mark eurobonds when the bundesbank opened that market to foreign banks in may 1985, due to the lack of reciprocity for german banks in the japanese market.     last year, the japanese began a slow opening by granting west german banks investment licences.     pressure on tokyo stepped up last week when u.k. government sources said britain may revoke the licences of some japanese banks and securities firms operating in london when they come up for renewal if progress is not made towards opening japan's markets to foreign competition.     a spokesman for the dai-ichi kangyo representative office here said the bank was naturally considering options such as expanding its mark securities trading operations to frankfurt.     sources at the bank's london branch said the bank was already seriously planning such a move.     expanding secondary operations would also improve the placement capacity of japanese houses intending to move into lead management of mark eurobonds.     but even japanese banks already established in secondary markets here face a host of problems in lead management. one is finding borrowers.     one banker at nikko securities co ltd's the nikko securities co (deutschland) gmbh said the cost of mark issues may be too high for some japanese firms.     "for the moment, for japanese borrowers, marks are expensive," he said. many prefer swiss francs or eurodollars.     a japanese borrower with a five-year equity warrant eurodollar bond issued at 2-1/2 pct can now swap into domestic yen rates of one pct. but mark swap opportunities are limited.     in addition, many japanese companies are committed already to large german banks.     to avoid souring relations with german banks they now cooperate with, japanese houses may prefer finding borrowers so far not seen in the mark sector.     names may include sanyo electric co ltd and nishimatsu construction co ltd, which both count yamaichi securities co ltd as their house bank, or hokkaido electric power co inc, which recently gave a presentation here with the industrial bank of japan's unit here.     japanese banks are also faced with finding local personnel, which is not easy. "they are definitely going to have a manpower problem," one swiss banker said.     swiss and american banks had no trouble attracting top german managers. but japanese cultural differences will be harder for germans to overcome. success may depend on whether japanese parents allow german subsidiaries independence to operate without interference.     once established, more problems are expected if extra competition shaves margins.     extra competition could cut management fees in the mark sector. separate management and underwriting fees common here may also be eroded, which now make german underwriting business profitable compared with other centres.     a few banks are unsure if they really want to get involved in the business. "i don't think sumitomo has 100-pct concrete plans at this moment unless there is a new development," a banker at the west german commercial branch of sumito bank ltd in duesseldorf said.     apart from the commercial branch in duesseldorf sumitomo has a rep office in frankfurt, but both are primarily engaged in commercial banking. if sumitomo were to set up a securities operation, it would have to set up a full subsidiary, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
