	<h3>the outlook for mexico's economy and stockmarket remains optimistic despite the market's worst-ever fall of 52,671.56 points on monday, the president of the mexican stock exchange, manuel somoza, said.     he said the 16.51 pct drop in the exchange's index reflected a "totally emotional" reaction to monday's fall on the new york stock exchange and was not a reflection of a new crisis for the mexican economy or the stockmarket."     he was speaking at a news conference here on monday.     "we think that after the psycological effect the market will tend to stabilize itself," somoza said.     somoza said he based his optimism on the relatively bright outlook of the mexican economy due to increased income from oil and non-petroleum exports, record high foreign reserves and government efforts to promote a modernization of the industrial sector.     "the u.s. economy is not the same as the mexican," he said. he did not say when he thought the market would stabilize.     he said traders had originally expected the market to level out on monday after last week's profit taking pulled the index down 44,207 points.      news of the "enormous problems" in new york, which reached mexico city before the local market opened, caused a flurry of selling on the mexican exchange, somoza said.     the stockmarket had risen 629 pct over the year by the end of september.     somoza said monday's light volume of 15.3 mln shares compared to an average of 53 mln was an indication the day's drop was not a sign of a major collapse.     he also denied rumours that the day's loss was the result of government and brokerage house manipulation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
