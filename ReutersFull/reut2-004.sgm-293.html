	<h3>the securities and exchange commission removed a key regulatory obstacle to trading futures on designated foreign debt securities on u.s. exchanges.     the move would allow the chicago board of trade, cbt, to apply to the commodity futures trading commission, cftc, for approval of a futures contract on yen bonds.     the cbt has said it may apply for approval of the yen bond futures contract, a cftc spokesman said.     the sec's action, which was approved by a 4-0 vote, specifically removes a regulation against trading futures on designated foreign government debt securities on contract markets that are not located in the country that issued those securities.     futures on the government debt securities of japan, canada and great britain can already be marketed in the united states under a designated exemption issued by the sec.     but the new move would permit u.s. exchanges to apply to the cftc for approval of establishing futures contracts on those securities, sec officials said.     the new sec move would also allow those foreign government debt securities to be marketed in the united states by countries other than those that issued the securities, the officials said.     since the foreign government securities underlying the futures cannot be traded in the united states unless they are registered with the sec, settlement and delivery of the futures would often take place in the foreign country, the sec officials said.     the sec is also considering expanding futures trading of additional countries' government securities to be marketed and traded in the united states, the officials said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
