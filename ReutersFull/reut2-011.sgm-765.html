	<h3>brazilian farmers, angry about high interest rates, staged fresh protests yesterday in the southern state of rio grande do sul and three people died when a lorry careered into one of the farmers' roadblocks, police said.     a series of protests involving hundreds of thousands of farmers has disrupted rural towns since january as the growers blockade roads and bank offices with farm machinery.     the estado de sao paulo news agency said about 300,000 of the 500,000 small farmers in rio grande do sul took part in yesterday's protests. the state is a leading producer of grains and soybeans.     the estado de sao paulo agency quoted finance minister dilson funaro as saying the government was very concerned about the farmers' situation and particularly about their credit problems.     the government provides limited cheap credits at 10 pct annual interest, but farmers are repaying bank loans at more than 400 pct since the recent surge in inflation.     brazilian press reports say financial pressures have driven some farmers to suicide in recent weeks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
