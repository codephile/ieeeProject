	<h3>bank of canada governor john crow said he expects the canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of 1986.     "we see moderate growth," crow told a news conference following presentation of the central bank's annual report in the house of commons today.     he said there were positive signs of growth in the economy, particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth quarter. yesterday, statistics canada reported gross domestic product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.     crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. canada's inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.     the governor said canada's banking system remains sound despite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in debt plagued countries such as brazil.     "it (the debt problem) is not a happy development but i think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact," crow told reporters.  reuter &#3;</h3>
