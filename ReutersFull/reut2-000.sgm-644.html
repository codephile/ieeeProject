	<h3>moody's investors service inc said it lowered the ratings on about 390 mln dlrs of fluor corp's long-term debt and commercial paper.     moody's said the action, which completes a review begun february 6, reflects expectations that pressure on earnings and cash flow are likely to continue for some time.     this will result in stress on debt-protection measures, although the firm's continuing core businesses have strong positions within their industries. ratings cut include those on senior notes, eurobonds and pollution control bonds to ba-2 from baa-3 and commercial paper to not-prime from prime-3.  reuter &#3;</h3>
