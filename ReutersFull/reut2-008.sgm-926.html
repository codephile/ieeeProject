	<h3>showboat inc said the play money opening of gambling at its atlantic city, n.j., showboat hotel, casino and bowling center has been delayed pending the receipt of regulatory approvals.     gambling with play money was to have started tomorrow. a company spokesman said showboat must still receive its certificate of occupancy, after which the new jersey casino control commission needs about 48 hours to set up for the trial-run gambling. after the trial run, showboat is required by commission regulations to run at least one day of low-limit betting.     the spokesman said, however, that showboat still expects to start normal gaming operations on april 3 as scheduled.  reuter &#3;</h3>
