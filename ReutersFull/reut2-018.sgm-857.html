	<h3>the tanzanian government, in its second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery program inspired by the international monetary fund, announced increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on government services.     finance minister cleopa msuya said the government expected to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8, 39 pct more than this year's estimate. revenue would provide 48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to be financed through domestic and foreign loans.     this year's budget initially projected a deficit of only 3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. no figure for the final deficit was avaialble.     the budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with effect from july 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30 pct.     msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct, with similar increases in the cost of premium and kerosene. diesel would rise by 75 pct.     the higher levies affect official transactions such as road tolls, vehicle transfers and various licence fees, he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
