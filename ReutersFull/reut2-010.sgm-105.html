	<h3>usx corp chairman david roderick said the company had ended talks with british petroleum co plc <bp> about the possible sale of some energy assets and said usx has no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses.     "we have terminated our discussions," roderick told reuters after a speech to the petroleum equipment suppliers association here. he said usx was not conducting talks with any other possible buyer of its energy assets.     earlier today, bp said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per share for the standard oil co's <srd> publicly held stock.     usx said in december the company had held formal discussions with bp about the potential sale of some of its overseas oil assets and usx had received expressions of interest from a half dozen other oil companies.     roderick, in response to a question, said usx had no immediate plans to restructure its marathon oil co, or texas oil and gas corp. he said usx also did not plan to sell any of its 49 pct interest in the giant yates field in west texas.     "we want to maintain our production in the yates field during these difficult times," roderick added.     in response to a question, roderick also said he did not know whether australian investor robert holmes a court was accumulating usx stock. in recent days, traders have suggested holmes a court was buying additional shares.     roderick said carl ichan, who terminated an eight billion dlr hostile takeover plan for usx in january, continued to hold a sizable interest in the company. "mr. ichan still apparently has 11.4 pct. he hasn't bought any more stock or sold any," roderick said. "he's a very satisfied shareholder right now. i talk with him monthly."     in his speech, roderick predicted the fall in the value of the dollar would set the stage for the u.s. to solve its trade deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986.     "i expect by the early 1990s the u.s. will be running a net trade surplus," roderick said. "i think the worst is over and we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead."     however, the usx chairman warned that european trading partners may resist the turn in the u.s. trade deficit. "some economic discomfort must be transferred from the united states to our friends, trading partners and allies."  reuter &#3;</h3>
