	<h3>linear films inc said it sees lower earnings in the fourth quarter ending march 31 compared with a year ago due to lower profit margins on stretch film from price increases of polyethelene resin, a key raw material.     in last year's fourth quarter it earned 1,235,000 dlrs or 19 cts a share, a spokesman said.     the company said it is raising its stretch film prices by six pct as of april 15 to reflect the higher costs of polyethelene resin. it also said sale volume of stretch film in the fourth quarter was lower than anticipated, although it has returned to normal in recent weeks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
