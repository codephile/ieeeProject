	<h3>u.s. treasury secretary james baker said he believes brazil will strike an agreement with its private creditors.     answering questions from the national newspaper association, baker said "brazil is not defaulting on its debt," and pointed out its interest payments moratorium was called because of dwindling foreign reserves.     he said that based on discussions with brazilian officials here last week, he believed brazil's approach to its problems was "nonconfrontational," adding, "we fully expect brazil will work this out with its private creditors."     baker pointed out brazil was paying in full and on time its debts to multilateral institutions, the u.s. government and other western creditor governments.     the country has declared an interest payments moratorium on 68 billion dlrs of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt and frozen some 15 billion dlrs in trade and interbank deposits by commercial bank creditors at brazilian institutions.  reuter &#3;</h3>
