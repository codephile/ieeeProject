	<h3>t. boone pickens, the texas oilman and financier, said he believes the heady days the oil service industry had in the early 1980s, when over 4,500 oil rigs were once reported operating, will not return in his lifetime.      pickens told reuters he expects the rig count to drop to below 600 before recovering. he added that oil prices will eventually rise to 35 dlrs, then to 50 dlrs after 1990.      currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the u.s., down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985 to around 10 dlrs in 1986. prices are now around 18 dlrs. the highest number of working rigs was 4,500 in december 1981.      "the rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs," he said, adding that while he expects to see 50 dlr a barrel oil, he does not expect to see 2,000 rigs operating in his lifetime. pickens is 58.      pickens, who is currently touring the country promoting his autobiography "boone," said he does not believe the u.s. should impose an oil import fee in order to stimulate the domestic oil industry.  reuter &#3;</h3>
