	<h3>morocco is likely to get an extra aid package exceeding 100 mln special drawing rights (126 mln dlrs) in 1987 following a three-day consultative group meeting of donors chaired by the world bank, moroccan finance minister mohamed berada said.     berrada said most of the extra aid sought to complete high priority investments in agriculture, education, and public health had already been secured, and additional sums were likely to emerge from forthcoming bilateral meetings with donors.     a world bank statement said the consultative group meeting attended by 15 donor countries and agencies noted with satisfaction a marked improvement in morocco's economic performance and urged it to continue recent adjustment efforts.     it added that the group saw as realistic morocco's medium-term goal of restoring creditworthiness on financial markets, and agreed to reconvene in a year to discuss morocco's five year development strategy for 1988-92, introduced in its broad outlines at this week's meeting.     morocco reached an agreement here last week with the paris club of western creditor governments to reschedule over 10 years the 900 mln dlrs of debt due by mid 1988. that followed an agreement late last year to reschedule 1.8 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt.     morocco's foreign debt currently totals 14 billion dlrs, berrada said, adding that morocco intended to stop rescheduling its debts, and pay them off instead.     he told reuters the forthcoming five-year development plan, designed to avoid the negative effects of adjustment without growth, could require further aid of 700 or 800 mln dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
