	<h3>federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said the u.s. trade deficit is a challenge for the u.s. equal to the soviet union launching of sputnik.     "the international challenge implicit in our huge trade deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of sputnik by the russians in the 1950s, when we suddenly feared we were to be left in the wake of soviet technological achievement," he said in an address to florida educators.      he said the trade problem underscored the need to reform the u.s. educational system to improve economic performance.     the commerce department reported last week that the nation's trade gap, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis, swelled to a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147.71 billion dlrs.     volcker called on educators to stress the development of basic reading, writing and mathematics skills and urged them to help students adapt to the fast-changing economic climate.     volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of low-income minority groups such as blacks and hispanics.              reuter &#3;</h3>
