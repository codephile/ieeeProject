	<h3>federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said international policymakers should make improving the stability of exchange rates a major priority.     in testimony before a senate banking subcommittee, volcker said he does not have any specific proposals for improving exchange rate stability, but thought it was worthy goal.     "i do think we ought to be thinking about and working toward greater exchange rate stability," volcker said. "i think that the objective of greater exchange rate stability ought to loom larger among our various policy priorities."  reuter &#3;</h3>
