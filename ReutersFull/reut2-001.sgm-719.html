	<h3>the senate banking committee has issued a revised draft bank regulation bill which would permit so-called non-bank banks to continue all their activities in progress as of march 5, 1987.     the bill, which the committee is scheduled to consider tomorrow, would prohibit non-bank banks from beginning any new activities after march 5, increase the number of their locations or cross-market products or services not permissible for bank holding companies.     the bill would also impose a one-year moratorium on bank securities or insurance activities.     the bill would establish a financing corporation to raise 7.5 billion dlrs for the federal savings and loan insurance corp and give federal regulators more power to arrange out-of-state mergers for failed or failing banks with 500 mln dlrs or more in assets.     committee chairman william proxmire, d-wis, had wanted to ban all non-bank bank activities started after july 1, 1983, but opposition from other committee members forced him to revise the legislation.     the house banking committee is also considering bank regulation legislation, but is waiting for the senate to act.      reuter &#3;</h3>
