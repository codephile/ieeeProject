	<h3>the australian stock exchange ltd (asx) today took up the responsibility for administering a new coordinated market made up of australia's six former exchanges, now operating as subsidiary trading floors.     at the same time, rules prohibiting corporations and non-stock-exchange members from holding more than 50 pct of australia's 101 brokerage firms were abolished, leaving brokers exposed to greater deregulation.     industry sources said the moves will smooth the changeover to screen-based trading and give the equities market one voice.     westpac banking corp <wstp.s> was one of the first to take advantage of the changes by announcing today it would double its stake in the sydney firm <ord minnett ltd> to 100 pct.     brokers have been introduced to creeping deregulation over the past three years after legislation passed in 1984 to end restrictive trade practices forced the traditional partnerships to open themselves at first to partial ownership by outside institutions, and eventually to full ownership.     the phase-in period has ended, and several major banks and offshore financial institutions are investigating taking larger stakes in australian broking houses, industry sources said.     though deregulation was all but forced on brokers, most now acknowledge that the influx of capital and contacts from non-member shareholders has benefited the industry, they said.     "deregulation has brought an infusion of additional capital and a broader base of products," asx chairman ian roach told reuters.     roach said fears that major bank shareholders would impose a restrictive and conservative "bank culture" on the dynamic sharebroking industry were unfounded.     "so far the banks have been mindful of the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial aspect of sharebroking," he said.     but some brokers said others are sceptical and expect that the expiration of "golden handcuff" pacts, which tied partners to their firms for a period after incorporation, could cause a massive talent drain.     several leading brokers have already announced plans to leave their firms and establish new private client businesses, while others plan public floats.     while bank shareholders have enjoyed dabbling in broking during australia's record two-and-a-half year bull run, they could find themselves without the expertise they need during more difficult times, some brokers said.     rene rivkin, head of sydney brokerage house <rivkin james capel ltd>, said many brokers will resist anything that restricts their individuality and entrepreneurial spirit, and this could leave new entrants into the business short-staffed.     "if i were a bank i'm not sure i would have gone into broking.... what's going to happen when a lot of these golden handcuffs come to an end?" rivkin said.     "only then will the banks know what they've got," he said.     rivkin's firm is 50 pct owned by hongkong and shanghai banking corp <hkbh.hk> unit <wardley australia ltd> and plans a public float of between 25 and 30 pct.     "my relationship with the hong kong bank is wonderful. they leave me alone and give me all the support i need.... maybe if we weren't doing so well there wouldn't be that support, but that hasn't happened," he said.     other firms might not be so lucky, he said, and they could find it difficult to preserve their independence when the bull market ends.     in the last two years, the value of the australian sharemarket has leapt 118 pct with turnover value up 152 pct to 31.24 billion dlrs in the year to june 30, 1986.     that growth put existing trading systems and clearing houses under pressure, and unification of the six sovereign exchanges should accelerate the development of screen-based trading and a single clearing house, industry sources said.     from july this year 30 leading stocks will be traded in a pilot of the asx's screen trading system which, depending on its reception by brokers, is expected to replace trading floors over the next four years, industry sources said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
