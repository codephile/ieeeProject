	<h3>shares prices were mostly higher at the oustset, bouyed by the latest opinion polls, one of which shows the ruling conservative party having a 13 point lead over the labour opposition party. record closes on both the new york and tokyo stock exchanges supported market sentiment.     dealers expect the market to open around five to eight points higher but then ease back should buying support fail to emerge. the market appears fairly convinced of a conservative win in the next general election but is likely to be restrained by uncertainty over its timing.     unilever rose 18p to 2,589 and british telecom 2p to 254.  reuter &#3;</h3>
