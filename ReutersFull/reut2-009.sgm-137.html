	<h3>bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount rate again as a way of preventing the yen's rise.     he told a press conference that the growth of japanese money supply remains high.     the bank will have to watch closely various developments resulting from its already eased monetary stance, such as the sharp rise in real estate and stock prices, he said.     although the yen's rise will have a greater deflationary impact on the economy, the economy is not likely to slow down much further, sumita said.     "i don't think we should change our economic outlook at the moment," sumita said.     sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year.     the governor said the six major industrial nations are expected to review last month's pact on currency stability when they meet next in april.     dealers said they expect the six - britain, canada, france, japan, the u.s. amd west germany - to meet just before the imf/world bank interim committee meeting in washington starting on april 9.  reuter &#3;</h3>
