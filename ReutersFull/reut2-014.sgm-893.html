	<h3>freeport mcmoran inc <ftx.n>, a new york listed new orleans-based natural resource, oil and gas company, is planning to build and run a surface sulphur mine in the central philippines, a company statement said.     it said freeport officials were in the philippines to discuss contractual arrangements with joint venture partner <international consultex (philippines) inc>.     the statement quoted robert foster, president of freeport sulphur co, as saying the company was optimistic about the proposed mine at pamplona in negros oriental province, as well as the country's investment climate.     "the sulphur project will involve initial capital expenditures of between 50 and 100 mln dlrs depending upon the processing technology and the capacity of the project," foster said. "we anticipate that the project may employ as many as 1,000 workers in negros oriental."     freeport-mcmoran's senior vice-president rene latiolais said the company was also interested in gold and other precious metals and geo-thermal energy development in the philippines.     the statement said freeport, which anticipates 1987 sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, is a major producer of sulphur, phosphate and nitrogen fertilisers, uranium oxide and geo-thermal energy.  reuter &#3;</h3>
