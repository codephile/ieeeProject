"we believe that a solid case continues to exist for soviet eep eligibility, and the recently announced and reported soviet purchases of u.s. corn indicate a soviet willingness to purchase u.s. grain if it is competitively priced," nawg said.     "consequently, we believe it is important to renew the u.s. eep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensure mutual adherence to the terms of the u.s.-soviet grain agreement," the letter said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
