	<h3>the directors of the american farm bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted tuesday to urge congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without alterations.     "we are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill," said dean kleckner, president. "the current farm bill has been in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining the legislation.     "several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced," kleckner said.     the farm bureau also urged agriculture secretary richard lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market.     a farm bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of pik certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate.     the organization also urged lyng to authorize deficiency payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat because of adverse weather.  reuter &#3;</h3>
