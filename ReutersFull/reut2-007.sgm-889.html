	<h3>miners at spain's state-owned hulleras del norte s.a. (hunosa) coal company have called a 72-hour strike starting on monday to protest against a restructuring plan that entails layoffs, union sources said.     they said more stoppages would follow in coming weeks.     the unions rejected a company compromise proposal to extend the period of the restructuring plan to four years instead of two and said there should be no job losses.     the company wants to shed some 2,000 jobs and start cutting back on production to help boost productivity by five pct yearly to the year 2000.  &#3;</h3>
