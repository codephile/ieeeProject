	<h3>zim energy corp said it has revised its loss for the year ended january 31 to 4.7 mln dlrs from the loss of 3.1 mln dlrs reported in march.     a spokesman said the larger loss, which has been reported on the company's 10k filing with the securities and exchange commission, reflects management's decision to write off 1.5 mln dlrs in costs mainly associated with an unsuccessful merger attempt.     zim also said it has a tentative agreement with "a major independent company to farm out its interest" in acreage located near currently producing areas of the buccaneer field located in the gulf of mexico offshore galveston, texas.  reuter &#3;</h3>
