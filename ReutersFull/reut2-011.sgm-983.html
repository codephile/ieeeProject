	<h3>u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter said the united states and argentina have settled a  case brought by the u.s. soybean crushing industry alleging unfair subsidies to argentina's crushing industry.     speaking to an agribusiness education forum here late yesterday, yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with argentine agriculture secretary ernesto figuerras during a trade ministers' meeting in new zealand last week.     under a verbal understanding between the two ministers, argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and products, u.s. and argentine officials said.     the u.s. case brought by the u.s. national soybean processors association alleged argentina, through differential export taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers.     the u.s. crushing industry, in its complaint under section 301 of trade law, said higher argentine export taxes on soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and represented an unfair trade practice.     yeutter told figuerras that all agencies of the u.s. government supported the u.s. complaint and unless argentina took steps to eliminate the taxes, the united states would consider taking further action in the case, u.s. and argentine officials said.     an argentine official here said no timetable was given for removal of the argentine export taxes.  reuter &#3;</h3>
