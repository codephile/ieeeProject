	<h3>volkswagen ag <vowg.f> managing board chairman carl hahn said the company was equal to the challenge of overcoming potential losses from allegedly fraudulent currency transactions.     he said the potential losses of 480 mln marks were a setback for vw but added the company's past conservative financial management meant vw was up to the challenge.     vw would not cut back on investment or fringe benefits because of the possible currency losses, he told workers in a speech before driving the 50 millionth vehicle produced by vw off the assembly line.  reuter &#3;</h3>
