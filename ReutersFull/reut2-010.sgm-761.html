	<h3>prime minister yasuhiro nakasone said that japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen.     he told a lower house budget committee in parliament that the six nations have taken measures, including market intervention, to support the dollar above that level.     finance minister kiichi miyazawa told the same committee that the six - britain, canada, france, japan, the u.s. and west germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen.     miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates.     asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the february 22 paris accord, he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially.     but he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations. he did not elaborate.     miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there has been such speculative dollar selling in the market.  reuter &#3;</h3>
