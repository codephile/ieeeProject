	<h3>u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng told representatives of several of the largest grain exporting firms and two farm organizations that he was not in a position to comment on their request that the reagan administration offer subsidized wheat to the soviet union, according to participants in today's meeting.     "he (lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talk about an eep (export enhancement program) initiative to the soviet union," said glen hofer, vice president of the national council of farmer cooperatives.     another participant in the meeting, who asked not to be identified, said lyng was "unresponsive" to the group's request.     participants in the meeting included cargill inc, continental grain co, louis dreyfus corp, union equity cooperative exchange, the national association of wheat growers, the national council of farmer cooperatives, among others, participants said.     deputy agriculture secretary peter myers and under secretary daniel amstutz also attended the 30-minute meeting.     hofer described lyng as "sympathetic but noncommittal," and said he thought he detected "a sense of frustration" on lyng's part at not being able to respond more positively to the group's urging.     a grain industry representative said some participants were "puzzled" by usda's apparent reluctance to bring before the cabinet council an eep wheat offer to the soviets.     "there is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been," this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referring to an eep wheat offer to the soviets.     this official said there was not a significant amount of pressure being exerted by lawmakers on lyng to make an eep offer to moscow.     reminded that senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy (d-vt.) had written two letters to lyng urging such an offer, this official said lyng had received virtually no phone calls from lawmakers on the subject.     but hofer said other important matters at the white house, rather than an absence of political pressure, might have restrained lyng.  reuter &#3;</h3>
