	<h3>the new singapore government securities market will start trading in late april or early may after president wee kim wee signs the development loan bill approved by parliament last week, bankers said.     but the new market is unlikely to attract many overseas investors, particularly as non-residents will be subject to a withholding tax on interest earned, loh hoon sun, general manager of <overseas union bank ltd>, said.     overseas union bank ltd is one of the five primary dealers approved to underwrite the auctions and ensure liquidity.     the monetary authority of singapore (mas), which approved the five underwriters, aims to issue seven billion dlrs of treasury bills, notes and bond issues in the first year.     a mas spokesman said a steering committee has yet to determine details, but most of the new government securities will have a maturity of up to five years and 10-year paper may be issued if demand emerges. bonds and treasury bills will be issued in denominations of 1,000 dlrs and treasury bills in a minimum denomination of 10,000 dlrs.     bankers said these rates will put the securities within reach of almost everyone and will create a more active market.     allocations will be made first for non-competitive bids from primary dealers prepared to accept average yields on up to 500,000 dlrs worth of notes and bonds and an unlimited volume of treasury bills. the remainder will be awarded to competitive bidders offering the lowest yields.     the new market should stimulate the local economy. funds will come from savings and fixed deposit accounts, "but just how much will depend on the bond yields," loh told reuters.     loh said bank interest rates currently stand at 3.0 to 3.5 pct for fixed deposits and the prime rate is 5.5 pct, and these rates are expected to remain fairly steady this year.     an act of parliament passed last week granted the singapore authorities permission to raise 35 billion dlrs in the new market over the next four years.     trading will be computerised and scripless.  reuter &#3;</h3>
