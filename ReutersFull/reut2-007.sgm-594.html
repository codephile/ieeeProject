	<h3>two world bank review teams are in the philippines to assess government requests for funding for an expanded housing plan and an accelerated land reform program, bank officials said.     they told reuters the housing program loan request is for 100 mln to 150 mln dlrs.     the government has said it will ask for another 500 mln dlr long-term loan from a world bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors to partially fund its land reform program.     the officials said negotiations will start next month on another 150 mln dlr loan sought by manila to carry out reforms in 14 major state-owned corporations.     on tuesday, the world bank approved two loans totalling 310 mln dlrs to help the country's economic recovery program.     the bank was also studying philippine proposals for loans to finance geothermal and education projects, sources said.     world bank sources said the bank's lending to the philippines since 1957, including the latest loan, totalled 4.3 billion dlrs. the money has been spread out over more than 100 loans and about 1.2 billion dlrs remains undisbursed.     the world bank sources said the bank cancelled 450 mln dlrs in loan commitments to the philippines during the last three years of president ferdinand marcos's rule. marcos was toppled by a military-civilian revolt in february 1986.     "the loans were cancelled because the projects slated for aid were not implemented properly," they said.     the sources said the bulk of this week's loan would be used to rehabilitate the state-owned development bank of the philippines (dbp) and the philippine national bank (pnb) which are saddled with seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.  reuter &#3;</h3>
