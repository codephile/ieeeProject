	<h3>head of the chamber of commerce's money and credit section, hellmuth klauhs, said the government should guarantee any company debts arising from the planned restructuring of the public sector.     klauhs said that there was no doubt that the government would meet its obligations. "but the owner should say this clearly once again," he added.     klauhs said 35 billion of 61 billion schillings owed by firms under the state holding <oesterreichische industrieholding ag> (oiag) currently had no formal state guarantee. nine of the 35 billion schillings were owed to foreign banks.     klauhs, also managing director of <genossenschaftliche zentralbank ag>, said banking industry officials would discuss the issue with finance minister ferdinand lacina next month.     lacina said last week a special guarantee would be unnecessary, as state industry had the financial power and enough liquidity to pay its debts.     the government has said the latest injection of state funds into oiag to cover losses will be the last.     under a restructuring plan, oiag is to create five new holding companies divided by sector.  reuter &#3;</h3>
