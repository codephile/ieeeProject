	<h3>u.s. money managers and investment advisors said they expect stocks to continue to outperform bonds, but some are hedging bets by keeping roughly half of portfolios in bonds and cash for quick investment shifts.     merrill lynch said its new asset mix report due today will urge weightings of 50 pct stock, 35 pct bonds and 15 pct cash versus 40 pct bonds, 35 pct stock and 25 pct cash previously.     "we believe an overweighting in stocks is warranted because of the positive momentum of corporate earnings," said christine lisec-tinto, merrill senior investment strategist.     lisec-tinto, who formulated merrill's latest asset mix recommendations with new chief investment strategist charles clough, said there may be some consolidation of recent stock price gains, but the market appears to have good potential.     through friday, stock prices as measured by the dow jones industrial average surged 19.13 pct in 1987. meanwhile, the  shearson lehman treasury bond price index edged up 0.4 pct.     "we believe that the equity market has much more upside potential than the bond market," chrysler corp <c> treasurer fred zuckerman said. he said "interest rates are not coming down and i would not bet a lot that they will come down sharply."     chrysler's 3.5 billion pension fund last week sold 405 mln dlrs of corporate bonds in the first of two planned sales of slightly less than one billion dlrs of corporates.     zuckerman told reuters the proceeds will be used to buy stock to bring equities to 50 pct or more of the portfolio.     a roughly even bond/stock portfolio split also is urged by wright investors service, with 4.25 billion dlrs under management, but it is more optimistic on bonds than stocks.     "we'd put half in bonds and half in equities now," said judith corchard, wright senior vice president. she said the bond share was lifted from 35 pct in the last three months.     "the stock market has appreciated sharply and discounted future corporate earnings extensively," corchard said. she said "we're worried about a stock price correction of as much as 10 to 15 pct within six, or possibly even three months."     meanwhile, wright expects bonds to benefit from a half to one percentage point decline in interest rates by year's end.     "at this level of the stock market, there is more of an advantage to being in long-term bonds than in equities, given our interest rate scenario," corchard said.     "the stock market has come a long way in a short time. i'd be hardpressed to jump into stocks with the dow near 2300 unless i was really convinced that earnings and multiples will increase," said a fixed-income securities portfolio manager at a major money center bank.     he said the bank has kept bond/equity portfolio mix fairly stable recently and probably will make no major changes for months as it awaits economic, oil price and dollar trends.     "we've seen no real movement from bonds to stocks among our funds," said george collins, president of t. rowe price associates, with 22 billion dlrs in assets under management.     while he detected no rush into stocks from bonds, either among the many mutual funds under the t. rowe price umbrella or among outside money managers, collins thinks stocks are better investments than bonds at this time.     "in the near term, the stock market has more prospects for growth, due to the mixed signals on the economy so far, the slim chance the federal reserve will ease policy and still heavy debt accumulation," collins said.     he expects u.s. stocks to improve further because there is more corporate earnings potential, nominal interest rates already are low and there is strong foreign demand for stock.     collins said that in funds which include bonds and stocks, the firm has long maintained an aggressive 75 pct weighting in equity with the rest in bonds and cash.     "our equity managers have taken a slightly heavier cash position in equity portfolios lately," collins said.     "cash" in portfolios usually means short treasury bills which can be readily sold to allow rapid investment shifts.     many portfolio managers are working with relatively high cash positions in equity accounts, often 25 to 30 pct, given   the belief that there may well be downward price corrections enroute to higher ground.     in bond portfolios, the money managers generally showed a preference for shorter term (10 years and under) treasury notes and, to a lesser extent, agency securities, rather than longer-dated treasury issues and corporate bonds.     since yield premiums of corporate over treasury bonds are now the lowest in years, many investors believe corporates are overvalued versus treasury and agency issues. another negative cited for corporate bonds is the risk of hostile takeovers, leveraged buyouts and sudden ratings declines that does not exist with treasury or federal agency securities.     farm credit paper was cited by some as undervalued and a good buy, despite the issuer's well-publicized financial woes.  reuter &#3;</h3>
