	<h3>banner industries inc said a judge of the u.s. district court in chicago ruled that banner must resolve its pension fund dispute in arbitration rather than in federal court.     the court's ruling stems from a lawsuit banner filed in federal court last may seeking a ruling that it is not liable to the central states fund for about 20 mln dlrs in pension withdrawal liability payments.     banner said the district court reserved ruling on whether it must pay about five mln dlrs that the central fund claims is owed in back-due interim payments.  reuter &#3;</h3>
