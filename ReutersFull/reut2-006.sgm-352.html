	<h3>cathay pacific airways ltd <caph.hk> forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over the year-earlier period.     the airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987 but said it would take delivery of one boeing co <ba.n> 747 freighter and one boeing 747-300 passenger plane in september and november respectively after it took a 747-300 last month.     it earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 1.23 billion h.k. dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14 cents a share.     but cathay pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.     a spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft deliveries in 1986.     however, the company said in a statement good returns from funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and other borrowing.     it added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel prices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in 1985.     passengers carried by cathay pacific totalled 4.2 mln last year, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometre travelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion. but passenger load factor was down to 69.1 pct from 71.0 pct.     the airline's cargo operations recorded growth of 21 pct in total tonnage over the previous year and a 35.9 pct rise in revenue to 1.79 billion dlrs.     cathay pacific floated its shares in april, 1986 and is now 50.23 pct owned by swire pacific ltd <swpc.hk>, 16.43 pct by hongkong and shanghai banking corp <hkbh.hk> and 12.5 pct by <china international trust and investment corp>.  reuter &#3;</h3>
