	<h3>a further cut in west german taxes to overcome the current weakness of the domestic economy has been called for by thomas wegscheider, management board chairman of bank fuer gemeinwirtschaft ag.     he said in  an interview due in tomorrow's die welt newspaper that tax cuts already decided by the government should be expanded by implementation of the "stability law," which allows tax cuts of up to 10 pct for a limited period.     wegscheider also said a temporary rise in state borrowing resulting from such cuts would be tolerable, according to excerpts of his remarks released early by die welt.     in line with a pledge made at the paris monetary conference in february, the government announced in march that 5.2 billion marks worth of tax cuts would be added on to reductions of some nine billion marks already scheduled for next year.     wegscheider said the bundesbank should pursue its policies aimed at lower interest rates and said a reduction in money market rates could encourage private capital market investment.     earlier today the bundesbank's vice-president helmut schlesinger said the central bank saw no current reason to change its monetary course.  reuter &#3;</h3>
