	<h3>bank of zambia general manager michael mwape has accused the international monetary fund of ignoring social conditions when drawing up its economic reform programmes for african countries.     mwape said in a speech to businessmen in the southern town of livingstone yesterday that the imf's approach had caused social and political unrest across the continent.     there was widespread rioting and looting in zambia last december after the government abolished subsidies on refined maize meal in line with imf recommendations.     mwape said told businessmen "the question which should be asked and answered when designing programmes is who is going to bear the brunt of adjustment ... and what cushion is available to minimise the burden ?"     zambia has had five imf adjustment programmes since 1976, the last of which was cancelled in february last year, he said. "in spite of these, the economy has shown signs of stress, with no significant improvement in a number of areas," he added.     zambia has just completed a new round of imf talks on its foreign exchange system and has obtained enough commercial loans to pay off its imf arrears for 1985 and 1986, paving the way for a new stand-by credit.     zambian politicians have frequently criticised the fund, however, and diplomats say president kenneth kaunda faces consistent opposition inside the ruling party's central committee over dealings with the imf.  reuter &#3;</h3>
