	<h3>senate democratic leader robert byrd said he and other critics of nicaragua rebel military aid will lose this afternoon an attempt to block 40 mln dlrs in funds to the contras.     "we're going to lose today," the west virginia democrat told reporters.     the senate votes at 1600 est/2100 gmt on giving the u.s. backed rebels, also called contras, the last installment of a 40 mln dlr military aid package congress voted last year.     however, byrd also said that he would continue to try to bring up for senate action later this week a house-passed, six-month moratorium against further nicaragua assistance until president reagan accounts for missing funds previously voted by congress and from the secret arms sales to iran.  reuter &#3;</h3>
