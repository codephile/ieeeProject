	<h3>the 1.4 mln tonnes capacity bauxite refinery at paranam in surinam, which closed at the end of january after being sabotaged by anti-government rebels, has now reopened, a spokesman for dutch metals company billiton said.     the refinery is run by suralco, jointly owned by the u.s. company alcoa and the dutch company billiton, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of royal dutch shell.     production of alumina at the refinery is currently running at around 3,000 tonnes a day and is expected to get back to full capacity of 4,000 tonnes within a week, the billiton spokesman added.     the refinery was forced to close at the end of january when rebels cut the main power line.     earlier, the refinery had had to import some supplies of bauxite, as rebel activity shut off supplies from alcoa's mine at moengo in the east of the country.     billiton's mine at onverdacht, between paranam and the capital paramaribo, is still working but moengo remains closed and the refinery is continuing to import some bauxite, the billiton spokesman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
