	<h3>the federal reserve entered the u.s. government securities market to arrange 1.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a fed spokesman said.     dealers said federal funds were trading at 6-1/2 pct when the fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system.     most had expected the fed to supply reserves directly via system repurchase agreements or to add them indirectly through two billion dlrs or more of customer repurchase agreements. some believe the fed is adding fewer reserves than are needed to keep upward pressure on rates and so help the dollar.  reuter &#3;</h3>
