	<h3>the finance ministry appears ready to allow japanese financial institutions to use overseas financial futures markets, a ministry official said.     he declined to say when, but banking sources expect approval as early as april. banks, securities houses and insurance companies are expected to become eligible to deal in deposit, interest rate, bond and stock index futures.     ministry officials said they are wary of giving permission to individuals or corporations because of their relative inexperience.     broking for japanese residents by financial institutions would be prohibited as securities exchange laws bar banks from doing this, the banking sources said.     overseas subsidiaries and branches of japanese banks and securities houses have already been allowed to use the overseas futures markets on their own accounts.     the finance ministry ordinance based on foreign exchange administration law will have to be revised to allow local institutions to join the overseas markets, a ministry official said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
