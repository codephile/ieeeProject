	<h3>china's fifth securities market will open on april 1 in the industrial port city of tianjin, the people's daily overseas edition said.     it said the market will in its first phase trade four bonds, two issued by banks, one by a well-known city bicycle factory and one issued by the city government to finance construction of a road.     buyers and sellers can either agree on a price between them and register the deal with the industrial and commercial bank that will run the new market or entrust the bank to make the deal, it said.     the paper said that only financial organisations and not other firms or individuals could handle such trading.     china's first securities market opened last year in the northeast city of shenyang and, since then, others have opened in shanghai, peking and harbin.  reuter &#3;</h3>
