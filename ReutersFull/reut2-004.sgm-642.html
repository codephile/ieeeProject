	<h3>expanding global links between futures markets mean that the singapore international monetary exchange (simex) must add chicago and london to its list of rivals, banking sources said.     when simex and the sydney futures exchange (sfe) introduced u.s. treasury bond futures last autumn, the sources expected to see fierce rivalry between the two exchanges, ending with only one winner in asia.     but surprisingly, the challenges now appear to be coming from the other side of the world, they said.     the chicago board of trade (cbot) will introduce night trading in its u.s. treasury bond contract on april 30, which could clash with simex morning activity, banking sources said.     the cbot had planned to introduce night trading on april 2, but postponed the move to allow participants time to prepare.     the london international financial futures exchange (liffe) could cut further into the simex contract with a u.s. treasury bond contract that can be offset on the cbot, they said. such a liffe contract is expected later this year.     liffe liquidity could be higher than at the simex, where average daily volume in treasury bonds dropped to 165 in february from 1,286 last october when the bonds were first introduced.     the contracts were set up to attract hedging from the rapidly growing underlying cash market in u.s. treasury bonds in toyko, but interest has waned as that market has grown more stable, traders said.     restrictions on investments by japanese residents have also inhibited the growth of the futures contracts in both singapore and sydney, the banking sources said.     nevertheless, all 450 seats on simex are now taken, with the last trading at 55,000 dlrs against the initial price of 50,000 dlrs. the current bid is 55,500 dlrs, but offers at 65,000 show that confidence in simex remains, said michael killian, general manager of chase manhattan futures corp.     killian, a simex board member, said the cbot night session might raise arbitrage opportunities and simex would benefit from a local stock exchange index contract planned for the end of 1987. simex also became more competitive after this month's budget eliminated withholding tax on interest earned on futures margin deposits.     banking sources said the tax change would boost simex trading by non-bank institutions and individuals and would benefit foreign firms and institutions.     while the treasury bond contract has been somewhat disappointing, other simex contracts continue to expand, fong yew meng, simex assistant general manager, told reuters.     volume in the simex's nikkei stock index, based on the tokyo stock market, has risen to a daily average of more than 1,000 contracts this month, from 320 contracts last october, helped by uncertainty during the recent bull run in tokyo stocks, fong said.     open interest in the nikkei contract, introduced last year, reached a record 2,697 on february 26.     killian said the nikkei contract has considerable potential for expansion, as overseas investors have been avoiding the contract because they currently see no need to hedge the rising cash market in tokyo.     simex is also enjoying record trading in other contracts. in february, total volume on the exchange reached a record 122,819 contracts, surpassing the previous monthly record of 116,767 set in september. eurodollar volume reached a record 78,546 contracts last month against 70,306 in september.     simex is likely to try to maintain its growth by moving into options soon, but competition continues regionally as well as globally, banking sources said.     the sydney exchange plans to introduce by june a share index futures contract based on a composite of stocks on which equity options are traded, which could generate more liquidity than the ordinary index, banking sources said.     local interest in the sydney treasury bond contract may also flare if the sydney exchange establishes a three-way link with chicago and london, traders in sydney said.     liffe is discussing such a link with the cbot, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
