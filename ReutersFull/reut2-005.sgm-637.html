	<h3>more than 500 people arrested during last week's riots in northern nigeria will face summary trial by a judicial tribunal, president ibrahim babangida said.     he said investigations showed the the violence was carefully planned by "evil men" and those arrested would be tried for arson, murder, rape and treason, some of which carry the death penalty.     babangida said the crisis was "the civilian equivalent of an attempted coup d'etat" against the government.  reuter &#3;</h3>
