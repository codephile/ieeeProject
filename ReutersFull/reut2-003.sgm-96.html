	<h3>the supreme court declined to hear an appeal by u.s. west inc <usw> challenging whether a consent decree was legally binding on the seven regional telephone firms created by the breakup of american telephone and telegraph co <t>.     the justices, without comment, let stand a ruling by a u.s. court of appeals last august that the restrictions of the 1982 decree were legally binding on the regional companies, even though they were not parties to it.     u.s. west, one of the seven regional companies, argued that the restrictions violated the constitutional protections of due process under the law because at and t did not adequately represent its subsidiaries during the consent decree proceedings.     the justice department urged the supreme court to reject the appeal, saying, "as a parent corporation, at and t had the legal authority to bind (its operating subsidiaries) in a consent decree."     also opposing the appeal was at and t.     the appeals court ruling also allowed the bell operating companies to offer certain services outside their territory without express permission of the federal courts.     that part of the ruling was not appealed to the supreme court.     justice antonin scalia did not take part in today's ruling, and the court gave no explanation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
