	<h3>the world bank is expected to approve a 310 mln dlr economic recovery loan for the philippines at a meeting of its executive board today in washington, central bank sources said.     the sources said the loan, agreed upon in principle last september during a visit to the united states by president corazon aquino, had been held up by philippine government delays in fulfilling key conditions.     they said the documents required by the world bank were not submitted by manila until late february.     the sources said the loan is needed to rehabilitate the the state-owned philippine national bank (pnb) and the development bank of the philippines (dbp), which together are burdened with seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.     they said the world bank had insisted the two banks appoint independent auditors and draft revised charters.     it also laid down several conditions for an asset privatisation trust (apt) planned by the government to dispose of the banks' unproductive assets, the sources said.     the apt, set up in january, is headed by banker and businessman david sycip.     the sources said the world bank wanted respected private sector individuals to be appointed to the apt, and immunity from prosecution for the trust. it wanted a clause saying buyers of non-performing assets could not be prosecuted.     the manila standard newspaper quoted rolando arrivillaga, world bank representative in the philippines, as saying the loan would be in three 100 mln dlr tranches. the first tranche would be available late this month or in early april.     arrivillaga said the remaining 10 mln dlrs was in the form of technical assistance available for disbursement during a 36-month period.     finance secretary jaime ongpin has said approval of the loan will trigger another 300 mln dlr loan expected from the export-import bank of japan.     the central bank sources said negotiations would start in april on another 150 mln dlr loan from the world bank to implement reforms in the government corporate sector.     the sources said the world bank is expected to approve the loan by august, after a review of the government's non-financial institutions. the government's 14 major corporations rely heavily on budgetary support to supplement external borrowing to meet their yearly revenue shortfalls.  reuter &#3;</h3>
