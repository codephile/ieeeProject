	<h3>a cypriot tanker was set ablaze in the persian gulf yesterday after an iranian gunboat fired missiles at it, shipping sources quoting reports from japanese tankers said today.     no casualties were seen and the tanker pivot, laden with crude oil, was towed towards dubai by tugs after they put out the fire, the sources said.     iranian gunboats usually check a ship's nationality and cargo before attacking but the pivot was hit near bu musa island without warning, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
