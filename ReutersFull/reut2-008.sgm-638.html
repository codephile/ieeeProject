	<h3>barbados is making its annual trip to the international capital markets a bit earlier this year and has mandated barclays bank plc to arrange a 25 mln stg revolving credit, barclays said.     the financing will be for seven years, with four years grace, and will allow the borrower to make drawings in u.s. dollars. the credit will be transferable and carry interest at 1-1/8 pct over the london interbank offered rate. there is a commitment fee of 1/2 pct.     banks are being invited to join at four mln stg for 50 basis points and at 2.5 mln stg for 40 basis points.     the terms represent an improvement over those obtained last year, when barbados tapped the market for a 25 mln dlr transferable loan facility, which carried the same maturity but had interest at 1-1/4 pct over libor. the facility was subsequently increased to 40 mln dlrs.     however, the loan was not signed until november 5, and bankers said that this year barbados wanted to have the financing in place early to give it greater flexibility in drawing the funds over the course of the year.     last year barbados boosted its capital market borrowings with a small private yen placement in the japanese market.     at the signing of the 40 mln dlr facility, winston cox, advisor to the central bank of barbados, said he was looking to make greater use of the international capital markets to reduce the country's dependence on multi-national orgainsations.     however, bankers believe this will be the country's only major financing for this year, although another small private placement in japan could be arranged later in the year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
