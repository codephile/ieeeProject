	<h3>u.s. senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy (d-vt.) said three senators probably would be added to the panel in the next week.     sen. david karnes, the nebraska republican recently appointed to replace the deceased democrat edward zorinsky, probably will join the minority side, leahy told the national cattlemen's association.     the committee chairman said he would like to have sen. john breaux (d-la.) join the majority.     leahy would not say who would be the other democrat to join the committee, which with the new members would be split 11 democrats to nine republicans. sen. james exon (d-neb.) is known to have expressed an interest in joining the panel.  reuter &#3;</h3>
