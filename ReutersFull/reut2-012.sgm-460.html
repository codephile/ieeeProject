	<h3>japan's leading economic organisations urged the government to prepare drastic pump-priming measures even at the cost of shelving prime minister yasuhiro nakasone's planned tax reforms, officials involved said.     officials of the federation of economic organisations (keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the government should issue construction bonds as an emergency measure to prop up the economy.     keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in the newly-privatised nippon telegraph and telephone corp should also be used to stimulate the economy.     keidanren chairman eishiro saito said the dollar's fall below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies that could shake the foundation of the japanese economy.     the keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for drastic reflationary measures sent to the government by the japan chamber of commerce and industry.     both organisations called for stepped-up bank of japan intervention to stabilise exchange rates.     chamber head noboru gotoh told a press conference the awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up japan's gross national product (gnp) by about two pct.     gotoh said the government could cope with the present critical economic condition even if it put off its plan to stop the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.     the plan to reduce the fiscal budget is a pillar of nakasone's fiscal reconstruction program.   reuter &#3;</h3>
