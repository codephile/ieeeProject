	<h3>cadbury-schweppes plc <cadb.l> said it had asked the london stock exchange to launch a formal enquiry into dealings in the company's shares in recent months.     it said it believed such a move was in the best interests of shareholders following recent charges being made under u.k. insider dealing laws about the shares.     last week, former <morgan grenfell group plc> executive geoffrey collier was charged with insider dealing in cadbury shares.     collier resigned from the bank last year and was later charged with offences on deals in shares of ae plc <aeng.l>.     a stock exchange spokeswoman said she could give no specific details about the request. an investigation would be requested from the exchange as it had access to the relevant dealing records.     if it appeared that some offence had been committed details would be passed to the u.k. trade department, which had the power to bring charges under the companies' act.     no spokesman for cadbury was immediately available for comment.  reuter &#3;</h3>
