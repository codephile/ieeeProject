	<h3>the bermuda registered <jardine matheson and co ltd> has indicated it would participate in a local consortium led by hopewell holdings ltd <hpwh.hk> which has proposed to build the second airport here, a hopewell statement said.     jardine matheson will take up a five pct stake in the joint venture which has presented the government with a 25 billion h.k. dlr infrastructure development plan for hong kong's offshore island of lantau.     the proposal includes an airport, a deep-water port and highways linking with southern china.     hopewell, which initiated the proposal, owns a 20 pct stake in the consortium. chairman of the firm gordon wu said recently he expects the airport to start operation by mid-1992 and the whole project to be completed by 1993 if an approval for the project is obtained within a year.     other partners of the joint venture comprise a combined 20 pct stake by cheung kong (holdings) ltd <ckgh.hkg> and hutchison whampoa ltd <hwhh.hkg>, while wu said at that time the remaining 60 pct will be taken up by other interested parties -- the public, and probably the hong kong and chinese governments.  reuter &#3;</h3>
