	<h3>provincially-owned hydro-quebec said it had no obligation to supply electricity to other canadian provinces if it could sell it at a higher price to americans.     the utility told a national energy board hearing that u.s. utilities generally offer higher prices for electricity than those in canada because the americans want firm energy supplies.     hydro-quebec is seeking regulatory approval to sell 70 billion kilowatt hours of firm power a year to the new england power pool over 10 years starting in 1990. utilities in ontario, new brunswick and newfoundland oppose the sale.  reuter &#3;</h3>
