	<h3>jefferies group inc's new chief executive frank baxter said the company intends to review its operations, following the resignation of founder and chairman boyd jefferies, but he has no immediate plans for changes,     "we'll be examining all our practices," baxter said in a telephone interview, adding, "we do not expect any changes."     baxter also said he does not believe that any other jefferies employees will be cited for wrongdoing.     boyd jefferies, jefferies group's founder, agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating federal securities laws, jefferies group said in a statement released earlier.     the statement said the charges against boyd jefferies resulted from a transaction in which he, on behalf of the company, agreed to purchase certain stocks from entities controlled by ivan boesky and later resell the stock to those entities.     "that was boyd's transaction," baxter said.     baxter said that although jefferies group was censured, there were no fines imposed on the company and no restrictions placed on its business. he said he believes the news of the allegations and boyd jefferies resignation should not affect client confidence.     michael klowden, an attorney for jefferies group, said that although investigations are continuing into trading activity in general, he does not believe any probe is focusing on jefferies group or its employees.     "we don't anticipate any actions of any consequence," klowden said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
