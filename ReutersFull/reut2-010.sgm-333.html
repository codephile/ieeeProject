	<h3>botswana has stopped importing almost all meat products from zimbabwe after reports of a suspected outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the neighbouring country.     botswana's official news agency, bopa, announcing the ban last night, quoted agriculture minister daniel kwelagobe as saying only sterilised and canned animal products would be allowed into the country, with immediate effect.     he said zimbabwean veterinary officials had notified him that they suspected foot and mouth disease had broken out at insiza, 100 km northeast of bulawayo, capital of the mainly cattle-ranching southwestern province of matabeleland.     zimbabwean officials were not immediately available for comment.     the ban will affect products such as uncanned meat, milk, ham, butter and bacon, bopa reported.     botswana exports much of its high-grade beef to the european community and augments its local supplies with meat imports from zimbabwe.  reuter &#3;</h3>
