	<h3>u.s. car production is scheduled to drop by 10.4 pct to about 1.47 mln in the third quarter from last year's 1.63 mln as domestic automakers react to a drop in sales from last year's record levels, trade paper automotive news said.     automotive news said general motors corp <gm> has slashed its planned car production by 12.6 pct from last year's third quarter totals while ford motor co <f> is scheduling its plants to build 5.4 pct fewer cars and chrysler corp <c> will be off 18.4 pct.     but the paper quoted analysts as saying the production should be cut by at least 200,000 more units to avoid excessive inventory build-up in view of a relatively soft market for new cars.     through june 20, sales of new domestic-built cars are off 11.9 pct from last year's levels. only ford among the detroit big three is enjoying a sales gain.     gm and ford may be working to stockpile cars despite the market conditions because of the prospect of a strike in september by the united automobile workers union, analysts said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
