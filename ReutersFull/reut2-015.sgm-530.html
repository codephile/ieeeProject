	<h3>moderately active grain fixing was reported out of the u.s. but none of the business involved the significant voyages to the continent or japan, ship brokers said.     a steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the u.s. gulf to morocco and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the gulf to taiwan. a vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat flour from the gulf to aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500 dlrs.     grain from the great lakes to algeria made 28 dlrs against 27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of march.     market talk suggested a federal commerce vessel had been booked to move grain from the great lakes to morocco on comanav account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of oilseeds from british columbia to japan, but no confirmation was obtainable.     on the continent, shippers agreed 19 dlrs for wheat from la pallice to buenaventura and 10.75 dlrs for grain from ghent to naples/venice range. elsewhere, maize from east london to japan paid 22 dlrs.     soviet charterers reappeared in the timecharter sector and secured a 30,000 tonner from savona for a trans-atlantic round trip at 4,450 dlrs daily and a 31,000 tonner from antwerp-hamburg for a similar voyage at 4,250 dlrs daily.  reuter &#3;</h3>
