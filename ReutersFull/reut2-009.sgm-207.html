	<h3>abu dhabi's offshore abu al-bukhoosh oilfield in the gulf, shut since an aerial attack last november, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry sources said.     they said the abu dhabi government and compagnie francaise des petroles (total) <tpn.pa>, whose total abu al-bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.     unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off abu dhabi, last november 25.     the raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform.     western diplomats in the region say iran was responsible but tehran has blamed its gulf war enemy iraq.     abu al-bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.     the sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said.     facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said.     abu dhabi is the largest oil producer in the united arab emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said.     they also said iran was working to reopen its sassan field, part of the same reservoir as abu al-bukhoosh and located only a few miles away. sassan was heavily damaged by an iraqi air raid only 10 days before abu al-bukhoosh was attacked.  reuter &#3;</h3>
