	<h3>exxon co u.s.a. said it is extending marketing of its mid-grade unleaded gasoline, exxon plus, into the houston and dallas/fort worth metropolitan areas beginning early next month.     exxon corp's domestic subsidiary is already marketing the 89-octane unleaded gasoline along much of the east coast.     as it introduces the third unleaded grade, exxon noted, it no longer offers a leaded gasoline in the market, except in some rural areas where leaded gaosline will be made available to distributors who have a substantial need for the product to serve customers whose equipment was designed for leaded fuel.  reuter &#3;</h3>
