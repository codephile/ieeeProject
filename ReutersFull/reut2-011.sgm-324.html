	<h3>nl industries inc said it would seek an alternative to current plans to spin off its chemical operations if an affiliate tries to block the plan.     the company said the lessor of an nl chemicals pigment making plant in leverkusen, west germany, has indicated the plan, without the lessors consent, would allow the lessor  to buy the plant and terminate a supplies and services agreement.     nl said it disagrees with the lessor's position and will seek its consent to the spin-off. if the lessor does not consent, nl will pursue an alternative that will result in the separation of its chemicals and petroleum services businesses.     nl said it believes the alternative form of the separation would not require the lessor's consent, which would not be sought. the alternative would require approval by nl shareholders and other parties, which should be attainable, it said.     as previously announced, nl plans to distribute shares of nl chemicals inc common stock as a spin-off, through redemption of nl's series c preferred stock depositary receipts, when the redemption is not likely to result in significant tax liability to either nl or nl chemicals.     nl also said it may consider paying the redemption value of the series c preferred stock in cash instead of implementing the spin-off or the alternative for separating the two businesses.     under terms of the series c preferred, nl at any time may redeem the stock for cash. at feb 28, 1987, the redemption value was about 15 dlrs per depositary receipt, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
