	<h3>ugandan finance minister chrispus kiyonga has asked the national resistance council, the country's interim parliament, to approve 1,000 billion shillings (714 mln dlrs) in extra government spending over the last three months of this financial year, council sources said.     kiyonga told the council that because of high inflation, estimated to be running at over 150 per cent a year, the government needed extra money to keep its services running until the financial year ends on june 30.     the new appropriation requested by the minister is almost as much as the 1,127 billion shillings (805 mln dlrs) the government expected to spend during the whole year.     kiyonga said the government was having trouble keeping to the deficit target of 350 billion shillings (250 mln dlrs) contained in the original budget announced last august. the deficit was to be financed by borrowing.     the minister did not give a new budget deficit estimate.  reuter &#3;</h3>
