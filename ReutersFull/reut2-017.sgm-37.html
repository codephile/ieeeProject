	<h3>a large group of "other milds" coffee-growing nations will hold talks in guatemala next month to map their strategy for next september's meeting of the international coffee organisation (ico).     mario fernandez, executive director of the costa rican coffee institute, said delegates from mexico, the dominican republic, peru, ecuador, india, papua new guinea and five central american nations will participate in the two-day strategy session beginning may 4.     the main topic will be reform of what many producing countries perceive as the ico's unfair distribution of export quotas, fernandez said.     he said costa rica would press for quotas "based on the real production and export potential of each country in the past few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic" production levels rather than recent harvests and crop estimates.  reuter &#3;</h3>
