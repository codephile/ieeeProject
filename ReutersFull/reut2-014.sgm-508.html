	<h3>the commodity credit corporation (ccc) has reallocated 5.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees previously earmarked for sales of u.s. wheat to provide coverage for sales of u.s. vegetable oil to bangladesh, the u.s. agriculture department said.     usda said the action was taken at the request of the bangladesh government and reduces the guarantee line authorized for wheat sales from 25.0 mln dlrs to 20.0 and creates a new line of 5.0 mln dlrs for vegetable oils.     to be eligible for coverage under the ccc's intermediate export credit program, credit terms must be in excess of three years, but not more than seven years.     all sales covered by the credit guarantees must be registered and shipped by september 30, 1987, usda said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
