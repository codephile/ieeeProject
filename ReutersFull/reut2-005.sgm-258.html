	<h3>cathay pacific airways ltd <caph.hk> has won a two-year license from the hong kong government to operate scheduled flights to toronto, a cathay spokesman said.     he told reuters the airline had sought a five-year right to add toronto to its existing license to serve the united states and canada.     "we're pleased," the spokesman said. "it's important because toronto has a large ethnic chinese commmunity and there's a growing amount of travel."     canadian and british authorities must agree on air service rights before cathay can begin service to toronto.     cathay pacific is controlled by swire pacific ltd <swpc. hk>.     hongkong dragon airlines ltd, a fledgling locally  based airline, had opposed the move, saying that cathay should wait until its license for its u.s. and canadian routes expires in february next year.     a hearing started today and continues tomorrow. an application by dragonair is to start flights to malaysian cities including kuala lumpur and kota kinabalu. cathay is opposing dragonair's request.   reuter &#3;</h3>
