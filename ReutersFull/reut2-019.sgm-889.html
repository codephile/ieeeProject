	<h3>cxr telcom corp and torotel inc agreed in principle to settle pending litigation regarding the sale of torotel's former halcyon communications inc unit to cxr in march, 1986, the two companies said in a joint statement.     the agreement calls for cxr to pay to torotel 1,350,000 dlrs in exchange for return of a 2.5 mln dlr note and five mln cxr common shares valued at 1,7754,000 mln dlrs, the companies said.     in june, 1986 cxr filed the suit in san francisco federal court, charging that the 10.3 mln dlr price it paid for halycon was excessive, torotel said.     it also said that in is suit cxr asked for seven mln dlrs in damages, along with an unspecified punitive award.  reuter &#3;</h3>
