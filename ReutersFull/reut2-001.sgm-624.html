	<h3>central bank director daniel marx said argentina's creditor banks were divided on the country's request for rescheduling its foreign debt.     "there are difficulties (among the banks) to reach an agreement and find a unanimous decision," marx told a local radio station in a telephone interview from new york.     argentina's great efforts to comply with obligations on its 50 billion dlr foreign debt should be met by a reduction in interest rates on the part of the creditor banks, he said.     marx is in new york with argentina's debt negotiating team holding talks with the creditor banks' steering committee.     marx said the talks should not drag on. "if venezuela and mexico have concluded their negotiations, we want to end (ours) in a reasonable manner and as soon as possible," he said.     economy ministry sources said the steering committee was expected today to make a counter-proposal not unlike that made by treasury secretary mario brodersohn at the start of the talks between the two parties.     argentina is seeking a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet four pct growth targets in 1987. it also wants lower interest rates on its foreign debt. the united states said last week it would support a 500 mln dlr bridging loan for argentina.  reuter &#3;</h3>
