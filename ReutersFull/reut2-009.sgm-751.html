	<h3>taiwan has over one trillion taiwan dlrs in savings, official statistics show.     figures released yesterday show all forms of savings by individuals and public and private firms, including bank deposits, certificates of deposits and bond's, are running at about 37 pct of gross national product (gnp).     gnp rose by 14.35 pct in 1986 to 2.74 trillion dlrs.     taiwan's strict foreign exchange controls and lack of incentives to invest abroad mean its huge export earnings are mainly deposited in bank savings accounts, earning below four pct interest each year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
