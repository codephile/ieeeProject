	<h3><toronto sun publishing corp> said it was examining an idea for a new tabloid newspaper in britain after being being approached about the concept by a person in england it declined to indentify.     "we were talking to this individual and offered to help him in effect formulate his concept and that is about as far as it has gone," toronto sun publishing vice-president of finance bruce jackson said in reply to a query.     "we have not decided anything," jackson added. "it has not been brought to the board of directors for any kind of approval or heavy discussion."     jackson said that toronto sun recently produced a dummy newspaper for the individual to use in testing possible british market reaction. toronto sun publishes tabloids in toronto, edmonton and calgary, alberta and the houston post.     asked about possible financial or editorial support by toronto sun, jackson replied: "it is far too premature to discuss anything like that." he said further developments were unlikely to unfold for "at least a month."     jackson described the british tabloid market as "very competitive, but it is a very large market as well. it most likely doesn't take a large market share to be profitable there as long as you find the right niche."     he said toronto sun is approached almost every month about ideas for starting newspapers, mostly in north america, "as the toronto sun is known to be a newspaper group that has started papers.     "unfortunately, this one leaked out and it probably attracted a little more attention than it really deserves at this point," jackson said.     toronto sun recently dropped plans to start a second english language newspaper in montreal, citing a study that indicated the lack of a sufficient advertising base for such a paper.  reuter &#3;</h3>
