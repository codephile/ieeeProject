	<h3>peru's short-term foreign trade credit lines, regarded as vital to ensure smooth foreign commercial transactions, have more than doubled to 430 mln dollars under the 20-month government of president alan garcia.     central bank general manager hector neyra told reporters many of the credits were 90-day.     trade credits were 210 mln dlrs when garcia took office in 1985 announcing a tough stance limiting foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings.     neyra told reuters peru was current on interest payments on short-term debt, including trade credit lines and on about 750 mln dlrs in so-called  "working capital" credits.     trade credit lines were 880 mln dlrs in 1982, but fell in 1984 when peru stopped some payments to private foreign banks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
