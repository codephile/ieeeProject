	<h3>the quarterly session of the international tin council (itc) continued without formal agreement on an extension of the sixth international tin agreement (ita), but delegates said it was apparent there was a general consensus the agreement should be prolonged.     some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions from capitals, but informally most have indicated they favour an extension, delegates said.     this afternoon's session was used by delegates to seek further clarification on some of the issues involved, and to discuss internal matters.     some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session would be convened to adopt the resolution after the association of tin producing countries meeting april 14 to 16.     the full council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 gmt after a european community coordination meeting at 1100.  reuter &#3;</h3>
