	<h3>argentina could suspend payments on its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling radical party deputy raul baglini told a local radio station.     "argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth of the country," he added.     baglini, an observer at argentina's negotiations in new york with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks, told the radio del plata in a telephone interview that the banks were divided on the loan request.     baglini said that as a result, today's scheduled second day of talks had been postponed.     he said argentina was prepared to follow the example of brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt.     argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was to maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in 1987, baglini said.     "debtor nations should not have to take from their own pockets, that is their commercial balance, to meet interest payments," he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
