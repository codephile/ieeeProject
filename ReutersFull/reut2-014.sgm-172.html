	<h3>delta air lines inc said it began construction to expand its passenger terminal facilities at dallas/fort worth international airport.     adding a new nine-gate terminal that will be connected to delta's existing terminal by an underground tunnel will cost about 20 mln dlrs, a delta spokesman said.     the carrier will have a total of 32 gates, up from the current 23, when the terminal is completed in late 1988.     with the new "satellite" terminal, delta will be able to expand to more than 300 daily flights at the airport, up from about 200 currently, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
