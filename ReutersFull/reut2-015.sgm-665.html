	<h3>council of economic advisers chairman beryl sprinkel said the reagan administration remains strongly opposed to a tax increase, including 18 billion dlrs of new revenues in the budget plan by congressional democrats.     "we believe that significant increases in taxes would not reduce deficits and could have adverse effects on growth," sprinkel told the house rules committee.     he said the administration wanted to continue its policy of gradually reducing deficits through restraining government spending and promoting economic growth. sprinkel said cutting the budget deficit was the best way to lower the trade deficit.  reuter &#3;</h3>
