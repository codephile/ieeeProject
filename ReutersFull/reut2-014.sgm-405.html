	<h3>philadelphia electric co said the operations engineer at its peach bottom atomic power station has been replaced with another nuclear experienced, qualified engineer holding a senior operator license at peach bottom.     early last week, the staff of the nuclear regulatory commission ordered that unit three of the nuclear power plant be shutdown after determining that operators were sleeping on duty.     in a letter to the commission detailing actions taken as a result of that order, the utility said the operations engineer had been reassigned to corporate headquarters on april 6.     releasing its letter to the nrc, philadelphia electric said it "will have no future comment on this response pending nuclear regulatory commission disposition" of the case.     effective april 11, the utility said, it is establishing 24-hour coverage of operations by at least one independent, nuclear experienced engineer or physicist per shift posted within the control room complex who will report directly to the company's superintendent of nuclear operations quality assurance division at corporate headquarters.     immediately after receipt of the nrc order, philadelphia electric said, senior plant management began making unannounced control room visits during the night shift, adding this activity will continue until the planned additional 24-hour coverage operations are in place.  reuter &#3;</h3>
