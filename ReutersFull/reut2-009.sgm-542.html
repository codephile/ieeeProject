	<h3><john labatt ltd> anticipates a good fourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for the fiscal year ending april 30, president peter widdrington told financial analysts.     he would not make any specific forecast, but said he was optimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company's brewing and food products operations.     labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months ended january 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs. revenue for the nine months rose to 3.20 billion dlrs from 2.70 billion dlrs.     widdrington said labatt's three-year business plan, now being updated, targets total sales of about six billion dlrs, including 2.50 billion dlrs in the u.s.     labatt, canada's leading brewer, has expanded in the u.s. food products industry by acquisitions.     widdrington said labatt's strategy for u.s. expansion stemmed partly from its strong market position in the canadian food and beverage industry. the u.s. share of revenues for this year will be about 35 pct, rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
