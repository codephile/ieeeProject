	<h3>zaire agreed to limit its tin exports to 1,736 tonnes for 12 months from march 1 in line with an association of tin producing countries (atpc) plan to curb exports, the atpc said.     atpc executive director victor siaahan told reuters he received a telex from zaire indicating its willingess to take part in the plan to limit total atpc exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from march 1.     siaahan said zaire is expected to produce 1,900 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987, and that in 1986 its output and exports were about 1,200 tonnes.     the atpc hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by 20,000 tonnes and boost prices.     all atpc members except zaire and australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan. australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to its expected output this year.     the atpc consists of malaysia, indonesia, thailand, bolivia, australia, nigeria and zaire.     china and bolivia, important producers of tin, are not members.  reuter &#3;</h3>
