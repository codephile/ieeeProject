	<h3>the fully state-owned dutch chemical firm nv dsm <dsmn.as> said its 1986 net profit rose to 412 mln guilders from 402 mln in 1985, while turnover fell to 17.7 billion guilders in 1986 from 24.1 billion in 1985.     the company said 1986 dividend, which will be paid to the dutch state in its capacity of the firm's sole shareholder, would be raised to 98 mln guilders from 70 mln guilders in 1985.     in an initial comment on its 1986 results, dsm said the drop in 1986 turnover had been caused mainly by losses in the company's fertilizer division.  reuter &#3;</h3>
