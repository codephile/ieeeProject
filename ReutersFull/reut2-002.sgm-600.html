	<h3>the dutch central bank announced new eleven-day special advances at an unchanged 5.3 pct to aid money market liquidity, covering the period march 9 to 20.     the amount will be set at tender on monday march 9 between 0800 and 0830 gmt. the new facility will replace the current 4.8 billion guilders of seven-day advances expiring monday.     money dealers estimated today's money market shortage at 11 to 11.25 billion guilders, barely changed from yesterday.     they said call money was still relatively high at 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 pct as a result of the tight set of bids accepted by the bank for the previous seven-day facility.  reuter &#3;</h3>
