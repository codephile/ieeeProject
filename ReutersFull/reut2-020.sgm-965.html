	<h3>the pacific stock exchange said it plans to close at 1300 pdt rather than at its normal closing time of 1330 pdt because of the extraordinary volume of transactions.     the exchange also said it will use a closing rotation in all equity options series in order to determine a single closing price for the day and to match all outstnding market orders.     daily trading volume normally totals between 8-1/2 and nine mln shares, an exchange spokesman said, adding, volume totaled about eight mln shares one and one-half hours ago.     "there's a lot of anxiety of course, but no panic," stock exchange spokesman don alexander said of the trading activity.     "i think everybody's holding up under the situation very well."     the stock market suffered its worst setback in history on monday. after the close of trading the new york stock exchange said preliminary figures indicated a record 507.99 point drop in the dow jones industrial average.  reuter &#3;</h3>
