	<h3>cold and wet weather in northern, western and central parts of europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries, sugar statistician f.o. licht said.     temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields.     but in eastern and southeastern europe, warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth.     weather in the soviet union also allowed good beet development, licht said.     in sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant population is reported to be regular and good. cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal.     in the united kingdom and ireland, it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.     in france, belgium, the netherlands, and west germany, it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible.     in austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was favourable for beet growth, licht said.     in czechoslovakia and poland, it was mostly warm, favouring beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.     in the european beet growing regions of the soviet union, it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.     in south eastern europe, warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development.     labour trouble threatens the beet crop in spain. disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where beets are maturing very early this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
