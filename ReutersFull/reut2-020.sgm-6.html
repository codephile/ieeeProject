"we must watch things a little longer. new york is down 22 pct, london 10 pct, while compared to this japan is seven pct down," kyodo quoted him as telling reporters.     asked if he agreed with analysts who called the stock sell-off "black monday," nakasone said: "compared with times past, economics have changed completely." he rejected a comparison between the present situation and the stock market collapse of 1929 and the recession which followed.  reuter &#3;</h3>
