"people are saying that (those engineering hostile takeovers) might talk about getting the stockholders a better break, but they are really not interested in that as much as they are realizing gains for themselves," concluded the poll, conducted for the university of north carolina's institute of private enterprise.     the poll said 78 pct believe most takeovers are engineered by groups interested only in making a profit for themselves and who don't care about the impact on employees or the economy as a whole.  reuter &#3;</h3>
