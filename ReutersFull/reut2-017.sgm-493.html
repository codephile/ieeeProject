	<h3>thousands of tea workers of indian origin went on strike today to press demands for citizenship and voting rights in sri lanka, a union statement said.     the ceylon workers congress (cwc) said its 400,000 members launched a prayer campaign at temples and other places in a non-violent protest to get the authorities to expedite citizenship procedures.     a cwc spokesman said a three-day campaign was suspended after a cabinet committee promised to speed up procedures under a new set of regulations. trade sources said the strike did not affect production or today's colombo auction.  reuter &#3;</h3>
