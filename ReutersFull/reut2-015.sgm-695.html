	<h3>no raw sugar is being unloaded at tate and lyles refinery at silvertown on the river thames following a fire yesterday afternoon, tate and lyle plc said.     the fire destroyed a large sector of the main conveyor from the raw sugar jetty to the weighhouse.     the company said it is not yet known how long the jetty will be out of use but it hoped that by tomorrow unloading of the bulk carrier mykon wave will be able to continue using temporary arrangements, tate and lyle said.     the mykon wave arrived in the port recently with about 18,300 tonnes of bulk sugar from maputo in swaziland. about 1,600 tonnes remain to be discharged.     five other ships loaded with raw sugar are awaiting at silvertown to be discharged, tate and lyle added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
