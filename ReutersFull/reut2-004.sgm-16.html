	<h3>phillips petroleum co chairman c. j. "pete" silas said his company's stock, ranked fourth on the most active list of stocks traded today, rose partly because of steps it took to pare its debt.     silas told reuters in an interview today, "part of this strength results from the rise in oil prices and also because some of the analysts have been happy with the steps we've taken in 1986 to pare our debt."     phillips stocks rose 1/4 to 14 dlrs a share following recommendations by some oil analysts, a company source said.     phillips debt stood at 5.9 billion dlrs in december 1986 down from a 1985 high of 8.6 billion dlrs, analysts said.     "at 14 dlrs a share, phillips is priced closer to the actual price of oil," he added.     silas said, "if the analysts are right that oil prices will rise to 20 dlrs or higher, then it seems to make sense to buy phillips." he is, however, more cautious about the strength in crude prices, expecting the price to fluctuate between 16-18 dlrs a barrel for the year.     oil industry analysts said one reason for the stock's popularity of the stock is that it traded at a strong discount to its appraised value and was attractively priced for small investors.     charles andrew, an analyst who follows phillips for john s. herold inc of greenwich, conn said that the appraised value of the company, based on available data is 34.25 dlrs.     "the stock is trading at about 1/3 its appraised value. the company has tremendous leverage and if it can get its act together and if oil prices are steady to higher there is good room for improvement," he said.    but, he added, "if oil prices turn lower, there will be a lot of pressure on phillips."    phillips' shares fell as low as eight dlrs a share over the last 52 weeks with a 1987 low of 11-3/4 dlrs in 1987.    analysts say that the appraised value of the company could be revised due to asset sales of their oil and gas reserves.    silas told reuters that the asset sales which amount to about two billion dlrs for 1986 were completed and that none were planned.  reuter &#3;</h3>
