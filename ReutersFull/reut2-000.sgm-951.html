	<h3>opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, indonesian energy minister subroto said.     he told reporters after meeting with president suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the u.s. and europe which reduced demand for oil.     prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said.     he denied that opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. asked what opec's output level was now, he replied: "below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." he did not elaborate.     he said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all opec members stick by the cartel's december pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties.     he predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.     he also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency opec meeting.     he said opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "we hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters."     refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. but opec would get through this period if members stuck together.  reuter &#3;</h3>
