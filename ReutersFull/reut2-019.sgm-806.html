	<h3>consumer countries should not intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas, brazilian coffee institute president jorio dauster said.     "distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional," dauster, a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. "when consumers want to get involved, talks are much more difficult."     the main consumer country the united states and main producer brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the international coffee organisation (ico) met in february.     dauster said brazil's role when the ico meets in london in september will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries.     "we have sacrificed a great deal already," he said. "this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours."  reuter &#3;</h3>
