	<h3>stocks of tobacco companies rose sharply as investors grew more confident that an excise tax would not be imposed on tobacco, traders and analysts said.     they also said the stocks are relatively inexpensive since fear of the tax and of pending litigation regarding warning labels for tobacco products have kept many investors away recently.     philip morris cos <mo> rose 2-5/8 to 87-3/4, rjr nabisco <rjr> 1-1/4 to 57-1/2 and u.s. tobacco <ubo> 7/8 to 27.     "the near-term activity of these stocks has been dominated by external factors such as smoking restriction legislation, concern over liability suits and the possible imposition of excise taxes," dean witter analyst lawrence adelman said. "but the feeling is that many of those externals have been discounted in the price of the stocks."     adelman, who issued a positive recommendation on philip morris earlier this week, said there have been indications that the reagan administration's staunch opposition to tax hikes would short-circuit attempts to tax tobacco.     "the tobaccos do have more risks than regular consumer stocks because of these external factors," adelman said. "they are not for the weak-hearted, but they offer a lot of value for the aggressive investor."     in a market where everyone is looking for affordable stocks, trader drew schaefer of kidder peabody said, it is not hard to understand why the tobaccos, which have been depressed for a while in a positive market, are attracting buyers.     adelman believes one of the better buys is philip morris. "it is a powerhouse of potential growth in earnings, dividends and free cash flow. and the stock is cheap now," he said.     adelman expects morris to earn eight dlrs a share this year compared to 6.20 dlrs a share earned a year ago. in 1988, the company should report a profit 10.30 dlrs a share.  reuter &#3;</h3>
