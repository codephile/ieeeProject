	<h3>u.s. attacks on two iranian oil platforms in the gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs, tehran radio quoted iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh as saying.     the rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four american destroyers on monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the gulf, the minister told a news conference in tehran. he said the reshadat rigs, 120 miles (200 km) east of bahrain in international waters, were in the final stages of reconstruction after an attack by iraqi jets last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
