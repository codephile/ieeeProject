	<h3>the new york stock exchange said it and its new york futures exchange affiliate will move the expiration of their respective index options and index futures contracts to the opening of trading in the underlying stock on each expiration friday from the close of trading.     the exchange said it has submitted the changes to the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission for approval.     the exchange said, "the nyse has long advocated settlement in the morning rather than at the close of trading as a practical way to deal with order imbalances and price volatility which historically occur on so-called "triple witching days."     the triple witching hour falls four times a year when individual stock options, stock index futures and options on stock indexes all expire on the third friday of the month, which has led to volatile last-hour market swings.     on the last triple witching friday, december 19, the nyse traded almost 85 mln shares at the close of the market. the next triple witching hour will take place friday, march 20.     the exchange said, "morning settlement would expose order imbalances to the full sunlight of public disclosure, ensure the broadest dissemination of market information, and facilitate the participation of all interested investors."  reuter &#3;</h3>
