	<h3>international coffee organization, ico, producers will meet at 1500 gmt (0900 est) for a general discussion of the market situation, producer spokesman lindenberg sette said.     the brazilian delegate said several producers requested the meeting but brazil was not among them. the ico executive board's regular session this week has so far been confined to routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to revive export quota negotiations, delegates said.     talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how quotas should be allocated.     producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among producers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with most countries now prepared to wait for the ico's annual september council session to restart negotiations.     members of the inter-african coffee organization called for today's producer meeting to exchange views on the market situation, the producer delegates said.     the lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week was cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices in london and new york futures, traders said.     near may in london hit a five-year low this morning at 1,220 stg, about 50 stg below last night's close, they said.     the executive board session looks set to end today, following a final session at 1600 gmt (1000 est) when a consultancy report of the operation of the ico will be presented to producers and consumers, delegates added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
