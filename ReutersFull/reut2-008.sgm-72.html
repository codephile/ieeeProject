	<h3>britain's centrist liberal-social democratic alliance has crept ahead of the opposition labour party to become the country's second political force, according to a gallup opinion poll.     the poll, part of a survey carried out every week by gallup on behalf of the ruling conservative party, showed the conservatives with an eight-point lead at 38.5 pct, the alliance at 30.5 and labour at 30 pct.     it was published in the sunday telegraph.     but two other surveys, the mori poll conducted for the sunday times and the harris poll published in the observer newspaper, gave labour a nine-point lead over the alliance.     these polls showed 33 pct supported labour against 26 pct for the alliance, a grouping of the liberal party and the social democratic party, while 39 pct backed the conservatives.     the gallup poll results are the latest in a series of setbacks for the labour party, in disarray over its non-nuclear policy and plagued by internal feuding.  reuter &#3;</h3>
