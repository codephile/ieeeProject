	<h3>eurobonds for texaco inc subsidiaries were unquoted this morning as traders assessed the implications of the company's shock weekend decision to file for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of u.s. bankruptcy laws, eurobond dealers said.     the decision to file for bankruptcy follows a court decision that it had to post an 11 billion dlr bond to continue its court battles with pennzoil co <pzl>.     one head trader at a u.s. securities house said, "i don't want to be obstructive, but there genuinely is no market in texaco bonds at the moment. everyone is stunned by the decision (to file for bankruptcy) and can't really believe it."     one dealer noted that texaco subsidiaries have outstanding eurobonds totalling over three billion dlrs out of total borrowings of some 6.8 billion dlrs.     he added that many of the fixed interest eurobonds - dollar straights - had been trading "basis only" for some time prior to this weekend's news. this means traders could quote a two way price for the bonds but would not be bound to trade them. any trades would be negotiated.     he said that recently there appeared to have been some speculative buying of the bonds from the u.s. but that european investors had been overall sellers.     dealers noted that under the chapter 11 filing noteholders will receive no interest payments.     texaco also has eurobonds outstanding which are convertible into texaco inc common stock - known as convertibles. trading did not open in these issues either. one convertible dealer said, "we're waiting to see the result of today's court hearing." texaco is applying today in the texas courts for relief from having to post the court bond.     texaco shares were being indicated by over the counter share dealers here at around 26 to 28 dlrs compared with friday's close in new york of 31-7/8 dlrs.     pennzoil shares were indicated at 85 to 87 dlrs compared with friday's new york finish of 92-1/4 dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
