	<h3>a pressure leak in a containment building hatch at fpl group inc's turkey point nuclear plant has forced a brief reactor shutdown, a nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) spokesman said.     ken clark, the nrc's representative in atlanta, said no radioactivity escaped during the incident last night, which he described as "a relatively minor problem that poses no safety hazard."     clark said repairs were underway and turkey point unit 4, one of two nuclear reactors at the site south of miami, was expected to be reactivated later today.  reuter &#3;</h3>
