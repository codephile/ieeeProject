	<h3>finance secretary jaime ongpin said philippine investment notes (pins), to be offered to commercial bank creditors as part of the country's 13.2 billion dlr debt rescheduling, would revive the baker plan.     pins are tradable, foreign currency-denominated financial instruments with a six-year maturity, designed for conversion into pesos to fund government-approved equity investments within the philippines.     ongpin told reporters after a meeting with businessmen the government was planning to issue between 100 and 150 mln dlrs worth of pins at a discount of about 12.5 pct this year.     the plan, outlined by u.s. treasury secretary james baker 18 months ago, stalled because commercial banks balked at the idea of lending additional money, ongpin said. it had called for substantial new commercial bank lending and development bank aid in order to help debtor countries grow out of their economic troubles.     the pins provide a mechanism to finance the growth needed by these debtor nations, provided they are willing to welcome foreign equity investment into their economies, ongpin told a businessmen's meeting. "and this can now be achieved without forcing commercial banks into involuntary new money lending."     bankers in new york said given the booming market in debt-equity swaps, pins ought to work if manila issues the notes at an appropriate discount.     ongpin said the use of pins would result in anticipated savings of one billion pesos over the debt agreement's 17-year life.     the accord restructured 5.8 billion dlrs of previously rescheduled debt, 3.5 billion dlrs of debt falling due between january 1987 and december 1992, and 925 mln dlrs of new money lent by the banks in 1985 at a spread of 7/8 percentage points over london interbank offered rates (libor).     it also rolled over trade credits worth 2.9 billion dlrs.     ongpin said the philippines' 7-1/2 year grace period was better than mexico's seven-year grace period, while the pins proposal would result in savings of foreign exchange and generate pesos which would be reinvested in domestic enterprises.     ongpin said the restructuring of commercial bank debt, as well as of 870 mln dlrs of debt by the paris club of western creditor governments in january, was expected to reduce the country's debt-service ratio to between 25 and 30 pct from its current level of 40 to 45 pct.     he said the country's balance of payments was now projected at a surplus of about 1.2 billion dlrs in 1987, compared with a surplus of about 1.1 billion dlrs in 1986 and a previous projected deficit of 1.2 billion dlrs this year.     the philippine negotiating team refined the pins idea three times before the final agreement was struck last friday, ongpin said. "what we have now is pins iv," he said.     ongpin told the meeting he had kept his promise to gain terms better than those granted last year to mexico, which won a 20-year repayment at 13/16 points over libor.     "and they (mexico) are a long way from seeing any money cross the table even as of today," ongpin said, adding he expected much quicker approval from all the philippines' 483 creditor banks worldwide.     he said he had been in almost daily telephone contact with president corazon aquino, particularly when the banks began to take a very tough stance on pricing.     "but the president's instructions were unequivocal and unwavering, 'do not yield one more millimetre and i don't care how long it takes. get a green card if you have to, but don't come home without a deal we can all be proud of'," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
