	<h3>japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa expects the dollar to rebound soon, a ministry spokesman said.     he quoted miyazawa as telling japanese reporters that major industrial nations are aggressively intervening in currency markets worldwide to prevent a dollar free-fall.     the minister believes that market forces will push the dollar back up from its record low of 144.70 yen today, according to the spokesman.     miyazawa told the japanese reporters the u.s. unit fell because japanese investors sold dollars to hedge currency risks before the close of the 1986/87 fiscal year on march 31.  reuter &#3;</h3>
