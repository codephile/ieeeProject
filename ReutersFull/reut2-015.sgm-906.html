	<h3>rai research corp said it appears that the reduced level of sales may continue for the near term.     earlier, rai reported that third quarter net declined to 17,806 dlrs on sales of 1.3 mln dlrs from net income of 328,290 dlrs on sales of 2.2 mln dlrs a year ago.    it said sales declined as a result of reduced sales of permion battery separators to japanese customers and it does not know the duration or extent of these factors.  reuter &#3;</h3>
