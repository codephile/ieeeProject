	<h3>danners inc said it has agreed in principle for indian lp, a partnership associated with sherman clay group, to purchase 100,000 shares of redeemable voting junior preferred stock with a liquidation preference of 20 dlrs per share and cumulative dividends of 1.60 dlrs per share annually for two mln dlrs.     it said the partnership would also receive detachable warrants to buy 1,600,000 common shares at 1.25 dlrs each, payable in cash or in junior preferred stock at the liquidation preference value.                                 danners said completion of the infusion would allow the partnership to name a majority of its board.     in addition, danners said it granted the partnership an option to buy 200,000 more common shares at 1.25 dlrs each, exercisable if it should fail to meet any condition connected with the transaction or if principal shareholders should accept a merger offer from another party.  it said danners family members owning 171,538 shares have granted options to indian to buy their shares on similar terms and conditions.     the company said the danner family options provide that if the infusion is completed, the partnership will have the option starting six months later and ending in april 1992 to buy the shares at the last bid or last sales price, whichever is lower.     danners said the agreement is subject to a recapitalization by its bank group of outstanding loans, satisfactory company prospects, favorable opinon from an investment banker and closing by april 30, with possible extensions to no later than may 11.     the company lost 529,000 dlrs in the prior year.     danners said it has terminated its use of lifo inventory accounting, resulting in a restatement of its net worth as of february 1, 1986, the last day of its prior fiscal year, to 15.5 mln dlrs from 9,901,000 dlrs.  but losses for the year just ended will result in a net worth deficiency at the end of that year of about 4,400,000 dlrs or eight dlrs per share.     the company said it incurred unusual fourth quarter losses due to the previously-announced closing and disposition of 17 of its 35 3d discount department stores, inventory clearances and conversion to a new pricing and promotion system.     the company said if it should fail to perform under the deal, it could be liable for all expenses incurred by the partnership.  if it does perform but the infusion transaction collapses for another reason, it said it could be liable for up to 50,000 dlrs in expenses.     it said the danner family members who have agreed to the option have the ability to sell some or all of their shares to the partnership around the closing date at two dlrs each.     danners further said it expects to report a loss for the year ended january 31 of over 19 mln dlrs, substantially worse than it had expected.     the company said it also incurred losses in the fourth quarter on the disposition of nonoperating assets.  it said it expects to report results for the year soon.     danners said problems with its credit relationships, together with its losses for the year, resulted in its transaction with indian, which is intended to alleviate its problems.  reuter &#3;</h3>
