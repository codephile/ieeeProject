	<h3>jordan's key economic priorities are having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange reserves, prime minister zeid al-rifa'i said.     "first, the national treasury should be in sound shape when dealing with the public and other countries so that its credibility is preserved," he said in a television interview saturday.     "the second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of foreign exchange reserves to provide (the) stability and confidence needed by the government to meet foreign commitments."     rifa'i said jordan's outstanding government-guaranteed and commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio of 14.9 pct.     the figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars in outstanding loans at the end of september, according to latest central bank figures.     rifa'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists here that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies, is overvalued.     "the dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve its stability," he said.     the prime minister said he hoped the next arab summit would tackle the question of continuing financial aid to jordan. under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, jordan was to receive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from algeria, iraq, kuwait, libya, qatar, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates to help it resist israel.     but only saudi arabia met its obligations, while the others failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices.  reuter &#3;</h3>
