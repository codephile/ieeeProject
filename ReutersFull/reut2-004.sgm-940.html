	<h3>the u.s. has dropped its insistence that the floor price in a new international natural rubber agreement, inra, be revised downward under certain circumstances, conference sources said.     the surprise conciliatory move by the u.s. meets one of the producers' main concerns -- that the floor price, or "lower indicative price," remain unchanged, they said.     it is not clear, however, whether all consuming countries will follow suit, as a number of them, in particular britain, west germany and belgium, appeared to have strong reservations, the sources added.     the group of consumers has been seeking an adjustment of the "lower indicative price" (set at 150 malaysian/singapore cents a kilo in the present pact) if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.     the sources said the question of to what extent price adjustments should be automatic remains a problem.     conference chairman manaspas xuto of thailand has been holding consultations with producers and consumers throughout the day.     the consumers' group is now holding a separate meeting ahead of further consultations within the "president's group" tonight.  reuter &#3;</h3>
