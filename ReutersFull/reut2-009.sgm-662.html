	<h3>the house energy and commerce committee approved major trade legislation that will give president reagan authority to retaliate if negotiations to open foreign markets to u.s. telecommunications products fail.     the provision was part of a major trade bill the committee approved on a vote of 26 to 15. it will be wrapped into a trade bill being written in several house committees and due to be considered in the full house in late april.     the bill also requires foreign investors to file detailed reports to the commerce department on their u.s. holdings in real estate, securities or u.s. companies.     in response to congressional concern over the fujitsu proposal to take control of fairchild semiconductor corp., the bill would give reagan the power to bar foreign acquisitions of u.s. firms if the sale threatened u.s. national security.     the legislation would bar for one year imports of advanced audio digital tape machines unless the recording capability is disabled. the action was taken after the u.s. recording industry said the new machines would lead to rampant recording piracy and legislation was needed to protect their rights.     the bill authorizes government spending of 100 mln dlrs a year for five years to help pay for research by a consortia of semiconductor manufacturers.      reuter &#3;</h3>
