	<h3>the u.s. dollar closed lower after a day of thin trading as most operators were sidelined ahead of the international monetary funds meeting in washington this week, dealers said.     they noted the group of seven industrialised nations is expected to meet and discuss currency movements during the course of the imf gathering.     but some speculative selling of the dollar was noted on conviction that the bank of japan will intervene less during of the meetings. the dollar ended at 145.15/20 yen against tokyo's 145.25 close and new york's final 145.85/90.     dealers said, however, the japanese central bank bought dollar persistently throughout today and limited the dollar's falls.     the u.s. unit eased to 1.8205/15 marks from an early 1.8230/40 and new york's 1.8260/70 close.     it was under pressure also because most traders anticipated the currency meeting to bring little surprise, dealers said.     sterling advanced to 1.6200/10 dlrs from an early 1.6185/95 and new york's final 1.6175/85 on rising support to the ruling conservative party of britain, dealers said.     they said the pound gained ground on belief that prime minister margaret thatcher will call an early general election in june.     but chartists said they expect strong resistance around 1.62 dlrs.     elsewhere the dollar fell to 1.5137/47 swiss francs from new york's final 1.5180/90 and was lower at 6.0600/20 french francs against 6.0745/75.     asian dollar deposits were lower with the three months settling at 6-1/2 3/8 pct against friday's close of 6-11/16 9/16 and the six months eased to 6-5/8 1/2 pct from 6-3/4 5/8.     the hong kong dollar stayed on the weak side of its 7.80 peg with the u.s. unit, finishing at 7.8015/35 against friday's close here of 7.8005/25.     interbank rates were firmer following the local banks' move to raise prime rates by half-point to 6-1/2 pct, effective today, dealers said.     the overnight rose to 4-1/2 1/4 pct from friday's close of four 3-1/2, while the three months was unchanged at 5-1/4 1/16 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
