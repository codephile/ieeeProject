	<h3>current profits of japan's major firms in the october-december quarter rose four pct from a year earlier to 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct year-on-year rise in the preceding quarter, the finance ministry said.     the improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pct profit increase in non-manufacturing industries, supported by an 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in real estate, according to a ministry survey.     total sales of the 15,308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen or more which responded to the poll, fell one pct to 217,217 billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter.     current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth quarter dropped 13.7 pct to 2,394 billion yen against a 22.1 pct fall in the preceding quarter, the ministry said.     plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell 3.9 pct to 8,004 billion yen, compared with a 1.4 percent fall the previoius quarter.     ministry officials said the survey showed that the japanese economy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell if economic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy is heading for a recovery.  reuter &#3;</h3>
