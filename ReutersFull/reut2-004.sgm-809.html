	<h3>general mills inc, reporting stronger results for the third quarter ended february 22, said it expects the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.     the company said it expects to report "strong earnings per share growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987." it said this should be achieved despite expected non-operating charges in the final quarter.     general mills said these charges will likely offset non-operating gains, which included six cts a share in the first half.     general mills said at the end of the third quarter, its return on average equity was 31.6 pct.     it said major factors contributing to the third quarter improvement were an 11 pct gain in unit volume by consumer foods, continuing good profit growth at red lobster usa and strong performance in specialty retailing.     the company reported quarterly earnings of 56.9 mln dlrs, or 64 cts a share, up from 46.4 mln dlrs, or 52 cts a share a year ago. sales rose to 1.31 billion dlrs from 1.13 billion dlrs. year-ago data reflect a two-for-one common stock split.  reuter &#3;</h3>
