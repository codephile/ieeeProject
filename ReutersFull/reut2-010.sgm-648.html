	<h3>the jeddah-based islamic development bank (idb) said in an annual report its loans during the last islamic year fell 24 pct due to world economic recession.     total financing approved by the bank for projects, trade, and technical and special assistance fell to 756.9 mln islamic dinars in the year ended september 4, 1986, from 1,001.4 mln the previous year.     "due to a general recession in the world economy, the demand for development funds was low and there was a scarcity of processable projects in most member countries during 1406 (september 1985-86)," the report said.     it said a steep decline in oil prices had led to a major transfer of resources from oil-producing countries to industrial nations.     "the oil exporting member nations of the idb faced a major adjustment problem arising from a sizable decline in oil prices and loss of export earnings, affecting their position as potential suppliers of capital," the report said.     project financing and technical assistance loans fell to 175.7 mln islamic dinars in the year ended last september from 269.4 mln the previous year.     the report said although there was a reduction in foreign trade financing loans in the past year due to a sharp decline in the price of oil and various primary commodities, the quantity financed in physical terms of imports was higher.     foreign trade financing declined to 572.8 mln dinars from 668.2 million dinars the previous year. disbursements of loans, including previously-approved loans, fell to 557.2 mln dinars from 783.9 mln.     the bank in 1986 decided to establish a fund under the name "idb unit trust" to introduce and market financial instruments in line with the principles of islam, the report said.     "this experience will provide a foundation for the floating of other financial instruments in the near future through which the bank expects to mobilise even larger resources," the report said.     the idb was established by the 46-member islamic conference organisation and opened in october 1975.  reuter &#3;</h3>
