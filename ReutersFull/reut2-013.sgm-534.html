	<h3>finance ministers from african countries in the french franc currency zone called for more aid from the international banking community at a meeting here last friday, the french finance ministry said in a statement.     the talks, held to prepare for this week's international monetary fund interim committee meeting in washington, underlined that a considerable decline in bank aid to developing nations was a major source of worry.     the ministers noted that this decline was contrary to expectations on debt strategy which emerged from the october 1985 imf general assembly in seoul.     "even if to a certain extent the efforts of banks can be helped out by those of private investors, the contribution of the international banking community remains indispensable," the statement said.     they underlined the need, given present circumstances, for a new allocation of special drawing rights (sdrs) to relieve tensions on the exchange reserves of numerous developing countries, the statement added without elaborating.  reuter &#3;</h3>
