	<h3>pier 1 imports inc said it amended its record and distribution dates for its previously- announced three-for two common and 25 cts preferred stock split.     the split common and 25 cts preferred shares will be distributed on july 2, 1987, to shareholders of record june 24, 1987.     the stock split requires shareholder approval of an increase in authorized shares of common stock to 100 mln from 25 mln and an increase of authorized shares of preferred stock to five mln from one mln, the company said.     the change in the dates was based on the company's desire to have the additional common and 25 cts preferred shares trade for the shortest practical period of time on a "when issued" basis following a favorable shareholder vote at the annual meeting june 24, it said.     the previously announced record and distribution dates were may 13, 1987, and june 29, 1987, respectively, the company said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
