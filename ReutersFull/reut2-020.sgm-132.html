	<h3>goldman sachs and co has decided to make a billion dlrs of its own capital available to mutual funds to enable them to sell securities for cash if they need to do so, a senior spokesman for the investment banking firm said.     the spokesman said goldman took the decision on its own initiative on tuesday morning after a number of mutual funds had reported a cash squeeze because of a flood of redemptions by stock market investors.     the new york stock exchange and the securities and exchange commission were informed of the move, he said.     the spokesman described the action as an effort to be helpful. "we're not trying to encourage them to liquidate, but if it's needed, the money's there," he said.     the provision of one billion dlrs poses no undue burden on goldman sachs's capital, the spokesman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
