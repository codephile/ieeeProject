	<h3>the tin price is likely to rise to 20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord on export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell the metal at lower prices, a malaysian government bulletin said.     the malaysian tin bulletin said it is in producers' interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to 90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes overhang.     it said consumption by industrialised countries should stay at 160,000 tonnes and that international tin council creditors and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively unless there is a large and abrupt price jump.     the continued depreciation of the dollar could also help push up the price of tin, the bulletin said.     a depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin cheaper in sterling terms, it added.     "even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo," the bulletin said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
