	<h3>the dollar opened slightly lower in quiet trading, with dealers holding back ahead of the outcome of this week's top-level international monetary talks in washington.     the dollar began here at 1.5128/5138 swiss francs, down from the previous 1.5185/5195 close and the 1.5180/5190 francs in new york.     however, dealers were sceptical that anything other than a mere reaffirmation of february's paris accord was likely to emerge from washington. "the dollar is likely to stay stable or drift slowly down," predicted one dealer at a major u.s. bank.     the swiss franc was also slightly higher against the other major currencies.     sterling began at 2.4526/4557 francs, down from the previous 2.4547/4578 francs close, while the mark slipped to 83.09/19 centimes from 83.11/21 centimes.     the french franc opened at 24.97/25.00 centimes from the previous 24.98/25.02 centimes close.  reuter &#3;</h3>
