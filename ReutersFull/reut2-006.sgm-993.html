	<h3>the european community (ec) farmers' and farm cooperatives lobbies, copa and cogeca, have backed the ec commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisation mechanism, claiming it would not harm consumers.     in a letter to belgian foreign minister leo tindemans, current president of the ec council of ministers, they said the mechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidise oils and fats prices in the ec under some circumstances.     this would have been the case in may 1984, when soya oil prices cif rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne, they noted.     if such price stabilisation is not implemented, ec farmers should not be the ones to suffer through their prices and incomes from the financial consequences, the letter, made available to journalists, said.     under the commission proposal the mechanism would initially result in a tax of 330 ecus a tonne on both imported and ec produced oils and marine fats.     the mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, and possibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rose from present levels.  reuter &#3;</h3>
