	<h3>canada's national energy board has denied an application by quebec-owned hydro-quebec to export about three billion canadian dlrs worth of electricity to the new england states, a board spokeswoman told reuters.     the decision is to be made public later today, chief information officer ann sicotte said.     sicotte said the board rejected tha application after four months of hearings because hydro-quebec did not offer the electricity first to canadian provinces and could not prove it was surplus to canadian needs.     sicotte said hydro-quebec can apply for a review of the decision if there are new facts or changed circumstances, and could also launch an appeal with the federal court or file a new application.     hydro-quebec spokesman maurice hebert said the utility had not yet been officially notified and will have to study the decision before deciding what action to take.     the contract was a 10-year agreement with power exports beginning in 1990. "they weren't able to demonstrate that the electricity was surplus and one way to demonstrate that is by offering it to neighboring provinces," sicotte said.     hebert said the utility argued that it can generate  enough electricity to supply its u.s. and canadian customers.     "our position is that electricity is a manufactured product--so everyboday can manufacture it and anybody can buy some--if they (the provinces) want to buy some from us, we're willing to discuss it," he said.     the application is the first the national energy board has rejected outright, sicotte said.     new brunswick, prince edward island, and newfoundland had opposed the contract at energy board hearings this spring.  reuter &#3;</h3>
