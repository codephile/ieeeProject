	<h3>the american hospital association said the best way to prevent the spread of aids to hospital workers is for workers to wear protective clothing rather than through routine tests of all hospital patients for the disease.     the non-profit advocacy organization, which represents hospitals and patients, recommended that hospital workers should wear protective gear whenever there is a chance they will be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids, regardless of whether the fluids are known to be infected with aids.     the group also said that "reliance on negative aids test results to determine when to take specific precautions can lead to a false sense of security among health care workers."     so far there are nine cases on record of hospital workers contracting aids from hospital patients. despite the low risk of contracting, the group said, "hospital workers are understandly concerned about their vulnerability (to aids)."     there are 3.6 mln workers in the nation's hospitals with nurses and housekeepers the most likely to come in contact with blood and body fluids on a daily basis, the group said.     among the americal hospital association's recommendations were that health care workers exposed to body fluids must wear gloves, and in some cases, gowns, masks, and eye coverings.  reuter &#3;</h3>
