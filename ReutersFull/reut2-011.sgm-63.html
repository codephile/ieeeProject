	<h3>texas' cotton crop stands little chance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in that state, as very little cotton has been planted, according to texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts.     "it's still pretty early for cotton planting. only six pct of the crop was planted as of last week," said doug stillmann, a statistician at the texas agricultural statistic service in austin, a division of the u.s. agriculture department.     stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had begun in the rio grande valley and south texas areas only, with planting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to begin until next month. the high and low plains accounted for 60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in texas last year, stillmann said.     temperatures tonight in most of texas are expected to drop to freezing to the low 20s, although the lower rio grande valley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s, according to meteorologists at accu-weather inc.     the price of new-crop cotton on the new york cotton futures market rallied today on weather-related fears.  reuter &#3;</h3>
