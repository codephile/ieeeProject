	<h3>genetics institute inc, earlier reporting an increased first quarter net loss, said it expects to incur losses in fiscal 1987 "that are somewhat higher than those reported in fiscal 1986."     it had a loss of 4,504,000 dlrs for fiscal 1986 ended november 30, compared to a fiscal 1985 loss of 1,732,00 dlrs.     the company said the losses result from its strategic decision to invest prudent levels of equity in development of products the company can manufacture and bring to market.     genetics earlier said first quarter ended february 28 losses rose to 1,309,000 dlrs from year-ago loss of 937,000 dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
