	<h3>taiwan is expected to boost agricultural imports from the u.s. and europe in calendar 1987 to help balance trade, the council of agriculture said.     a council official, who declined to be named, told reuters the imports, which will include about seven mln tonnes of oilseeds, grains and dairy products, would be worth some four billion u.s. dlrs against 3.72 billion in 1986 and 3.38 billion in 1985.     taiwan's surplus with the u.s. rose to 13.6 billion dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985, government figures show.     government figures also show taiwan's surplus with europe rose to 1.53 billion dlrs last year from 543 mln in 1985.     taiwan's imports of u.s. farm produce last year amounted to 1.41 billion dlrs against 1.52 billion in 1985.     imports from europe rose to 182 mln u.s. dlrs from 148 mln, the official said.     he attributed the decline in the value of u.s. imports to falling agricultural products prices last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
