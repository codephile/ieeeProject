	<h3>fighting broke out between palestinian guerrillas and shi'ite moslem amal militiamen near camps in south lebanon as syria prepared to extend its military presence at beirut's settlements.     security sources in the southern port of sidon said the clashes erupted in villages to the southeast between amal and guerrillas loyal to palestinian leader yasser arafat.     syria stepped in yesterday to halt battles at two beirut refugee camps but amal said it would only lift its siege after arafat withdrew his men from the villages near sidon.  reuter &#3;</h3>
