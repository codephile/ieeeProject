	<h3>the tanzanian government raised the price of beer, soft drinks and cigarettes by 20 pct and telephone and telex calls by 10 pct in an attempt to keep its budget deficit for this financial year roughly on target.     the deficit for the financial year ending on june 30 was initially forecast at 3,350 mln shillings and the new measures will raise some 700 mln shillings in extra revenue, a statement from the ministry of finance, economic affairs and planning said.     according to the statement, the price increases, which take immediate effect, were needed because the government had lost tax revenue through lower than expected industrial production. water and power problems and a shortage of spare parts had reduced the output of tanzanian factories, it said.     the ministry also announced a new 30 pct tax on goods imported by non-resident businessmen and said the government would take steps against importers who have been evading duty in collusion with corrupt customs officials.  reuter &#3;</h3>
