	<h3>the u.s. wants japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting u.s. under-secretary of state for economic affairs allen wallis told eishiro saito, chairman of the federation of economic organisations (keidanren), a spokesman for keidanren said.     the spokesman quoted wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by congress.     wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with saito.     wallis was quoted as saying the reagan administration wants japanese cooperation so the white house can ensure any u.s. trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.     he was also quoted as saying the u.s. would be pleased were japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three, the spokesman said.     japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products. a ban on rice imports triggered recent u.s. complaints about japan's agricultural policy.  reuter &#3;</h3>
