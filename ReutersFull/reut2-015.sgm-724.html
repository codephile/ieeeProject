	<h3>the value of colombian exports other than coffee rose 55 pct in january compared with the same period last year, apparently setting a trend for the trade balance in 1987, government statistics institute figures show.     they amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared with 147.5 mln dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last year.     the trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared with a 56 mln dlr surplus in january 1986.     the national planning department forecast that in 1987 coffee, colombia's traditional major export, will account for only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
