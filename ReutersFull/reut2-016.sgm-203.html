	<h3>former guinness plc <guin.l> chairman ernest saunders dismissed allegations he ordered the shredding of documents in the early stages of a u.k. investigation as "completely untrue," the press association news agency reported. the allegations were made by his former personal assistant margaret mcgrath, in a statement to the high court on friday.     saunders' reply was read out by his lawyer at the start of the fourth day of a hearing, on an application by saunders and u.s. lawyer thomas ward for the discharge of "asset-freezing" orders obtained by guinness on march 18.     mcgrath alleged that among the documents destroyed were papers from the files on the <distillers co plc> bid, as well as diaries, correspondence and an address book.     the temporary orders froze property owned by the two men valued about 5.2 mln stg, the sum paid by guinness into a jersey bank last may during the distillers takeover.     they are also contesting orders requiring them to disclose the whereabouts of the money and hand it back to guinness lawyers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
