	<h3>the bank of spain said it raised its rate for overnight call money to 14.5 pct from 14 pct with immediate effect at today's daily auction for assistance funds.     the move followed comments yesterday by central bank governor mariano rubio, who said money supply growth was too fast.     the bank said later that it was leaving its rate for special assistance funds from its second window unchanged at 16 pct, surprising operators who had expected an increase there too.  reuter &#3;</h3>
