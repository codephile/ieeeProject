	<h3>japan looks likely to allow u.s. banks to conduct securities business here, a move that will probably cause the barriers separating japanese commercial banks from brokerage houses to break down, financial analysts said.     but the timing of the approval remains uncertain, due to conflicting domestic interests.     j.p.morgan and co <jpm>, bankers trust new york corp <bt>, manufacturers hanover corp <mhc> and chemical bank new york corp <chl> are expected to win approval to conduct securities business in japan, u.s. bank officials said.     "there is no reason for extended delay of approval," one official at a u.s. bank said. the four u.s. banks have been seeking finance ministry approval for months.     to date, japan has allowed european banks to do securities business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries. as japanese banks can conduct securities business in european countries, this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market.     but if u.s. banks win approval, japanese banks will press hard for similiar status, since they are not allowed to conduct securities business in the u.s.     many u.s. bank officials expect their applications to be approved before june. but japanese banking sources said the decision will be delayed until next year. a spokesman for the finance ministry declined comment.     u.s. bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months. ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in april or june.     at the last round of financial negotiations in september, u.s. officials said japan's commitment to deregulation was flagging.     analysts said the finance ministry has been seriously considering the u.s. request since the u.s. federal reserve bank of new york approved five new primary government securities dealers, including two japanese brokerages, last december.     they said the ministry will have to approve the u.s. request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the u.s.     analysts said japan has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses.     japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to protect their interests, but analysts said the banks are finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional fields.     officials of major japanese banks said they will pay special attention to the ministry's reaction to u.s. bank requests because approval would accelerate market liberalization in japan.     the japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way for their own entry into the domestic securities market.  reuter &#3;</h3>
