	<h3>a strike by machinists against eastern airlines is very likely before the end of the year and eastern pilots would probably honor the picket line, the president of the airline pilots' union said.      capt. henry a. duffy, president of the air line pilots association, told a group of aviation executives meeting in atlanta duffy said the pilots' union has a contract through 1988 with eastern airlines.     however, a contract between eastern and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers is due to expire this year, duffy said.     if the machinists strike, which seems likely, eastern pilots probably would refuse to cross picket lines, he added.     noting that the pilots' union had clashed several times with eastern's parent, texas air corp <tex.a>, duffy said, "we have had a difficult relationship with texas air wherever they have existed in the industry."     eastern's pilots had picketed the airline recently over new sick leave policies and duffy repeated criticisms of those policies in his speech today.     "the new policies pressure us to try to fly when we're sick against federal air regulations and pressure us to fly beyond federal air limits," duffy said. "for all those reasons, we don't see a very happy future over there."  reuter &#3;</h3>
