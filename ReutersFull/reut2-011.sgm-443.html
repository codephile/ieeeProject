	<h3>treasury secretary james baker told the house appropriations committee that he believes the president remains opposed to an oil import fee.     he said reagan last year rejected the idea and he added:     "in my personal view he is not likely to change his thinking on that."     he said reagan last year opposed the idea because the energy industry was divided on the issue, a tax would require a new bureacracy to administer and the resulting higher energy prices would harm u.s. competitiveness.  reuter &#3;</h3>
