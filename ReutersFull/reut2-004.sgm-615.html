	<h3>finance minister kiichi miyazawa told a press conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable due to the currency accord reached in paris last month by six major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long.     the dollar has hovered around 153 yen since the six agreed to cooperate to bring about currency stability.     asked to comment on remarks by some u.s. officials calling for a further decline of the dollar, miyazawa said only the u.s. president and the u.s. treasury secretary can make official statements about exchange rates.  reuter &#3;</h3>
