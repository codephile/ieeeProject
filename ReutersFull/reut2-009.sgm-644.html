	<h3>connecticut energy corp said its southern connecticut gas co unit filed with state regulators a letter of intent to raise its rates by 2.7 pct, or about 4.2 mln dlrs, beginning in late 1987.     the company said it expects to file a formal application with the connecticut department of public utility control within 60 days.     the company said a rate increase is needed to cover higher operating and maintenance expenses that have occurred since it last received a rate hike of three pct, or 4.8 mln dlrs, in january 1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
