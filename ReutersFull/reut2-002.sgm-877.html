	<h3>brazil's economic crisis is forcing a wholesale re-examination of the established strategy for dealing with developing-country debt, leading bankers say.     while finance minister dilson funaro is unlikely to succeed in his attempt at seeking an outright political solution to the debt problem, brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt has convinced at least some bankers that new ideas are needed.     "the time has come to look at the alternatives," one seasoned debt rescheduler said.     even before brazil's move, the difficulty in syndicating the 77 billion dlr financing package for mexico agreed to in principle last october was prompting top bankers to examine  the way they are managing the debt crisis.     federal reserve chairman paul volcker, too, spoke recently of "debt fatigue" and the need to breathe new life into debt rescheduling procedures.     there are already signs of change. japanese banks are setting up a jointly owned firm to which they will transfer some ldc loans in a bid to strengthen their balance sheets, improve financial management and get tax breaks.         but bankers said a move toward a greater governmental role will be gradual. "the process is such that you cannot expect tangible progress in a short period of time," one banker said.     certainly, funaro got a frosty reception in washington and several european capitals in the past week when he called on government officials to explain brazil's crusade for a political dialogue on debt.     assistant u.s. treasury secretary david mulford, for instance, criticized what he called large-scale solutions such as debt forgiveness or the creation of new multilateral lending agencies.     "while such approaches may have some political appeal, they are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," mulford told a house subcommittee this week. he could have added that any proposal that might be construed as a bail-out of u.s. banks would be a non-starter in congress.     but bankers said the reagan administration could promote accounting and regulatory changes to foster debt-equity swaps and debt securitization and to enable banks to consider interest capitalization as an alternative to new loans.     experts say the government must also make it easier for banks gradually to write down their third-world loan books.     mulford, in his congressional testsimony, urged the banks to explore different options. "the banks should be encouraged to look at the so-called menu approach," he said.     bankers said the aim would be to keep the loan syndicates intact or, conversely, to allow small banks to write off their exposure in a way that is not detrimental to major lenders.     big banks say it is unfair that small creditors continue to receive interest on old debt even if they do not contribute to new loans. in effect, large banks say they are making new loans that fund the interest payments on the old debt.     to solve this problem - and to streamline the cumbersome negotiating process - argentina has revived the idea of "exit bonds", which would be issued at a discount to small creditors in exchange for their existing debt, bankers said. the banks would be rid of the loans but would have to recognize a loss.     amid the swirl of new ideas, even the role of the commercial bank advisory committees has come under scrutiny.     the principle of consensus on which the panels operate was challenged recently when citibank - ironically, the original architect of the committee system - stubbornly refused for a time to endorse financing offers to the philippines and chile.     the strains have not gone unnoticed in washington. "there does seem to be a lot of speculation about the frailty of the bank advisory committees," a u.s. official said.     brazil's funaro heavily criticized the panels in london on monday, charging that they are unresponsive to new ideas and that u.s. banks are over-represented on them.     hannes androsch, chairman of austria's creditanstalt-bankverein, said there was some truth to the charge. "sentiment is growing in europe that we're no longer prepared to bail out the u.s. banks," he told reporters in new york this week.     while u.s. bankers obviously see things differently, some have started to wonder whether the advisory committee is still the right tool for the job.     "the debt crisis has probably evolved beyond the capacity of commercial banks alone, at least in some cases," one top new york rescheduler said.     but, with governments unable or unwilling to play a larger role, bankers see no alternative to the advisory committee.     "it's the worst form of government there is apart from all the others," one banker said, paraphrasing former british prime minister winston churchill's opinion about democracy.  reuter &#3;</h3>
