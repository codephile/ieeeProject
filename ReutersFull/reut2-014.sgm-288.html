	<h3>raw sugar futures rallied from session lows by late afternoon on jobber shortcovering and trade buying, posting pared losses from last night of 1.20 to 0.60 dlrs.     the rally mirrored a similar upturn in new york after the market had reacted bearishly to the realisation that new raws offtake from china and the soviet union was not materialising.     however, dealers said, sentiment was still buoyed by prospective whites buying by india, syria and pakistan.     tomorrow's european community (ec) tender result was difficult to predict after last week's authorisation of 102,350 tonnes at the highest-ever subsidy of 46.864 ecus per 100 kilos.     tomorrow's ec tender was made all the more difficult to project by the movement last week of nearly 800,000 tonnes sugar to intervention by operators protesting about low rebates, dealers said.     near aug was finally quoted at 154.60/154.80 dlrs (bid-asked) from 155.80/156 last night and a session high-low of 155.80/152.     volume late afternoon was 3,371 lots including nearly 2,000 lots crossed.     london daily raws prices fell 3.50 dlrs on tone to 147 fob and 171 (105.50 stg) cif and the whites 2.50 dlrs to 190.  reuter &#3;</h3>
