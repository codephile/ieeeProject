	<h3>martin sosnoff, who has offered to buy caesars world inc for 28 dlrs a share, said senior officials of the company have offered to buy back the caesars stake he already holds, now 13.6 pct of the total outstanding.     in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, sosnoff, a new york investor and money manager, said the offers to buy back his stock occurred "on several occasions during the past year."     the offers were made by several caesars world representatives, including its chairman, henry gluck, he said.     sosnoff said he rejected all of the proposals.     the caesars world official suggested various forms of payment for sosnoff's stake, including other securities of the company and cash, he said. sosnoff did not detail the value of the proposed compensation.     also suggested was a deal involving "put" and "call" option regarding sosnoff's caesars world holdings, he said.     the proposed deals would have also included a "standstill" agreement, which would have restricted sosnoff's right to buy more caesars world stock or "to take any action adverse to incumbent management," he said.     sosnoff's report on the offers he received for his caesars world shares were amended to his official offer to purchase the company, as well as reported to the sec.     sosnoff now holds about 4.1 mln caesars world shares, or 13.6 pct of the company's 30 mln shares outstanding.     the sosnoff offer to buy the shares of the company he does not already hold has been valued at 725.2 mln dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
