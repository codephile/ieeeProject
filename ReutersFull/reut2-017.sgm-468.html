	<h3>poor returns by oil refiners and utilities will drag down average current profits of major japanese firms in the year ending march 31, wako research institute said.     current profits will drop an average 13.5 pct after a 7.3 pct drop in 1986/87, it said.     oil refiners and utilities face a sharp profit fall after two years of high profits due to the yen's strength, lower world oil prices and reduced interest rates, it said.     sales of all firms are expected to rise 2.3 pct from the previous year when they fell 11.9 pct from a year earlier.     the independent institute surveyed 436 firms listed in the first section of the tokyo stock exchange, excluding banks and insurance firms. excluding the oil refiners and utilities, wako forecasts that current profits will rise 3.7 pct after a 22.3 pct drop in 1986/87 and a 19.5 pct drop in 1985/86.     electric power firms and gas companies are likely to see 42.5 and 31.6 pct falls in current profits respectively in 1987/88 due to cuts in utility prices to recycle windfall profits made during the yen's rise against the dollar, and due to the recent recovery in world oil prices, the institute said.     current profits of manufacturing industries will rise an average seven pct after a 29.7 pct drop in 1986/87 and a 25.0 pct drop in 1985/86, wako said.     an increase in overseas production and an expected increase in domestic demand will cause the recovery in manufacturing sector profits, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
