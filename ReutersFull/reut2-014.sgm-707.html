	<h3>firm oil prices, a sharp stock price fall and widespread fear that the dollar has much more room to decline sent bond prices tumbling, dealers said.     the key 7-1/2 pct treasury bonds of 2016 fell 1-3/32 points to close at 95-1/32 and a 7.94 pct yield that was up 10 basis points from monday and was 1987's highest closing yield.     "investors threw in the towel today. the long bond seems headed for eight pct within the next few days," a trader said. that would correspond to a price of about 94-3/8.     treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points. notes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4.     bond traders said the main negative is recent instability of the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted central bank support will not be able to prevent a further sharp decline in the u.s. currency.     the dollar came under mild downward pressure early and finished with modest net losses. the currency was largely unaffected by generally supportive comments by federal reserve chairman paul volcker and japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa.     miyazawa once again said he and treasury secretary james baker agree on the need for stable foreign exchange rates.     fed chairman paul volcker told congress that the dollar's fall thus far should be "large enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the u.s., to support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead."     despite favorable comments by volcker and miyazawa, there appears to be broad agreement among currency and bond market participants that a huge federal budget deficit and a wide, although narrowing, trade gap will further depress the dollar. that could mean japanese and other foreign investors will buy fewer u.s. bonds or even start selling them.     there has been no evidence of large-scale sales of u.s. bonds by the japanese. some dealers said that these investors actually purchased a modest amount of u.s. debt today, but they focused on shorter maturities in the two-year area rather than on long bonds.     to the extent that overseas investors back away from the u.s. bond market, dealers said that higher yields will be needed to lure others to take their place.     a late federal funds rate rise contributed slightly to the bond market retreat. after averaging 6.20 pct yesterday, funds opened at 6-1/8 pct and traded between 6-1/16 and 6-1/4 pct.     the federal funds rate rise occurred despite the fed's unexpected direct supply of temporary reserves. the fed arranged two-day system repurchase agreements with funds trading at 6-1/8 pct.     treasury bill rates increased largely in response to the higher funds rate. rates on new three and six-month bills rose two and seven basis points from monday's auction averages to close at 5.55/54 pct and 5.70/69 pct. year bills at 5.81/80 pct were up eight basis points from yesterday's close.     among notes, the 6-3/8s of 1989 dropped 1/8 to 99-9/16, with the 7-1/4s of 1996 down 3/4 at 97-3/8.  reuter &#3;</h3>
