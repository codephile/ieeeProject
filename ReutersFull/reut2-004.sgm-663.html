	<h3>indonesian energy minister subroto said opec is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target.     he told reporters at an energy conference in jakarta that opec had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs.     "we are deliberately defending the price, so opec production is less than 15.8 (mln) at the moment," he stated.     asked if opec would increase production if prices went above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the next opec meeting in june. "we will discuss the market situation then," he added.     he said a meeting of the opec differentials committee had been postponed because "there is no need for the meeting."     he did not elaborate. the committee had originally been due to meet in vienna this week.  reuter &#3;</h3>
