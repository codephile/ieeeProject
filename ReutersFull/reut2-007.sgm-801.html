	<h3>the u.s. will pursue its complaint that european governments unfairly subsidise the airbus industrie aircraft consortium in proceedings at the gatt civil aircraft committee, a gatt spokesman said today.     the u.s. presented its case for the first time to the aircraft committee of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) during a special two-day session ending today. gatt rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce.     the 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the u.s. complaint, starting with informal consultations and then holding a special session in july, trade officials said.     "the tension has eased," the permanent trade ambassador of the 12-member european community tran van thinh told reporters. "the u.s. has decided to go through proper channels."     u.s. trade officials again made clear their anger over what they call unfair government support for airbus, voiced during a visit to european capitals in february.     in a letter calling for the special committee meeting, washington charged france, west germany, the u.k., spain and the ec commission with unfair practices on behalf of airbus.     the u.s. charges that the europeans are violating rules laid down in the 1979 agreement on trade in civil aircraft.     washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines during the special session and asked the committee to confirm its view.     official sources in the delegations said the u.s. views would be considered during the informal consultations but the europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against american civil aircraft practices.     some delegates said the u.s. position appeared to give such broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil aircraft accord needed re-negotiating. all these matters would be considered during the informal meetings.  reuter &#3;</h3>
