	<h3>after years of refusal, moscow has agreed to discuss the problems of afghanistan and kampuchea in its talks with peking on normalising relations, chinese vice-foreign minister qian qichen said.    he told a news conference: "recently the soviet union expressed agreement to discuss this question."     china has long referred to three obstacles to better relations -- soviet troops in afghanistan, moscow's support for vietnamese troops in kampuchea and soviet troop concentrations along the chinese border.  reuter &#3;</h3>
