	<h3>bell canada, owned by bell canada enterprises inc, said it will reduce long distance rates in canada by an average of between two and eight pct, in line with a ruling by canadian regulators.     the company said it does not expect any change to net revenues.     the company said it will cut rates for calls within  ontario, quebec and parts of the northwest territories by an average of between two and three pct and by an average eight pct for other parts of canada, effective wednesday.         the changes will decrease the charges for longer distances and increase shorter distance rates, bell canada said.     the canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission ordered bell canada to reduce its phone rates because it said the company, which has a monopoly in certain areas, was making more than the allowable rate of return.  reuter &#3;</h3>
