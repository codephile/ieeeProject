	<h3>xerox corp has decided to stop selling personal computers as standalone products, a company spokesman said.     the spokesman said "as a first priority, we're selling pc's as part of preconfigured systems, mostly desktop publishing systems, and not by themselves anymore."     he said xerox does not expect to take any material charge from changing its marketing of personal computers.  he said for the past five years, xerox has sold most of its pc's as components of larger systems.     another xerox spokesman said the company actually stopped selling personal computers alone on february 16 but never announced the move.  reuter &#3;</h3>
