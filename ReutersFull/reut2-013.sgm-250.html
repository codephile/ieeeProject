	<h3>algerian and spanish producers which together meet 40 pct of the western market's needs in quicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300 dlrs per unit, the algerian news agency aps said.     the agreement was made during a meeting here last week between algeria's entreprise nationale des non-ferreux et substances utiles (enof) and spain's almaden to discuss the market situation.     the two firms "took note with regret that prices quoted by some specialised publications do not reflect the reality of the whole market since they take into account only part of the deals made," a statement by enof said.     the result is that the prices quoted are far away from two firms' production costs.     "they have thus decided that their selling price would not be linked any more to the prices quoted by these publications and that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fob per jar, which is close to their production cost," the statement said.     it added that turkish producers would join in when the two firms meet again in madrid later this month.     the price of quicksilver on the london metal exchange hovered around 200 dlrs this week.  reuter &#3;</h3>
