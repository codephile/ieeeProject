	<h3>debt securities issued by major u.s. banks are under pressure in the secondary market as investors shy away from the paper because of brazil's suspension of interest payments last month, analysts and traders said.     on february 20, brazil said it would suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercial banks. no date was established for the renewal of payments.     "buyers have backed away from bank paper. these securities have become very difficult to sell despite a rise in their yields," said one corporate bond trader.     "debt issues of major money center banks will probably continue to trade off until such time as the brazil situation is resolved," said loretta neuhaus, a vice president with merrill lynch capital markets.     "i have not told any of our investors to stay away from the banks in general," she added. "but i have not received too many inquiries by prospective buyers lately either."     traders said debt securities of u.s. banks that are perceived by investors to be heavily exposed to latin american debtor nations declined moderately in price last week. they said the difference between bids and offers widened.     "there is not much trading of bank issues these days," an underwriter said, referring to the wider bid/offer spreads.     however, he and others pointed out that the secondary market has not seen heavy selling by institutions, funds and other investors.     "the selling has been steady over the past couple of weeks. but it has been far from panicky," said another trader.     in addition, institutional sources told reuters on friday that salomon brothers inc lowered its investment ratings on the stocks of all u.s. money centers. but the sources said it is understood the action is not a sell recommendation.     while institutional sources said salomon lowered the ratings to m from o-plus on bank stocks, bond traders said this carried over to the secondary market and further undermined confidence in bank paper.     the banks affected by salomon's change in investment coding were bank of new york co inc <bk>, bankers trust co <bt>, chase manhattan corp <cmb>, chemical new york corp <chl>, citicorp <cci>, irving bank corp <v>, manufacturers hanover corp <mhc>, j.p. morgan and co inc <jpm>, marine midland banks inc <mm>, republic new york corp <rnb>, bank of boston corp <bkb> and first chicago corp <fnb>, sources said.     the institutional sources said salomon cited a filing with the securities and exchange commission by citibank, the lead bank of citicorp.     citibank said friday it told the sec its earnings could be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after-tax in the first quarter, and 190 mln dlrs in the year, if it has to declare 3.9 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term brazilian loans non-performing.     "i believe there will be some renegotiation along the way between brazil and the banks such that the banks will not have to charge off their loans to brazil," merrill lynch's neuhaus commented.     but until then, investors are widely expected to remain leery of buying bank paper, according to analysts and traders.     in an unrelated development, rjr nabisco inc <rjr> paid what some bond traders said amounted to a "penalty fee" when the company tapped the domestic debt market on friday.     rjr nabisco sold 500 mln dlrs of sinking fund debentures due 2017 via lead manager shearson lehman brothers inc. the debentures had an 8-5/8 pct coupon and were priced at 98.675 to yield 8-3/4 pct, or 115 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct treasury bonds of 2016. the yield and premium over treasuries was greater than a similar financing in january.     on january 22 nabisco sold 500 mln dlrs of same-maturity, same-rated sinking fund debentures priced to yield 8.62 pct, or 107 basis points over the 9-1/4 pct treasury bonds.     both issues were rated a-1 by moody's and a by s and p.     bond traders noted that nabisco has called for redemption around 1.2 billion dlrs of its 11.20 pct notes of 1997. nabisco will buy them back at 107.50, traders said.     "the redemption of an attractive double-digit yield issues has tainted nabisco in investors' eyes," said one trader. "obviously, a lot of prospective buyers believe nabisco should pay a higher yield because of that."     traders also asserted that the higher yield in friday's pricing reflected the total debt issuance of one billion dlrs so far this year by nabisco.     "investors may be showing some signs of indigestion," remarked one trader. traders said they expect nabisco will float more debt in the coming weeks to finance the redemption of the 11.20 pct notes.     officers on shearson's syndicate desk declined to comment.     idd information service said the 30-day corporate visible supply rose to 3.28 billion dlrs last week from 1.79 billion dlrs in the previous week.  reuter &#3;</h3>
