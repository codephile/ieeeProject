	<h3>brazilian finance minister dilson funaro met his swiss counterpart otto stich, swiss economics minister jean-pascal delamuraz and national bank president pierre languetin on the fourth leg of a tour to discuss his country's debt problems.     funaro told reporters his trip, which has already taken him to london, paris and bonn, was aimed at explaining his country's stance to governments. talks with commercial banks will take place at a later date.     funaro said a mechanism would have to be found to end brazil's debt crisis but it would not be easy.     brazil would not repeat the measures it took in response to its debt crisis of 1982, which he said had provoked the biggest recession in his country's history, he added.     he said european and japanese banks were showing a more flexible attitude towards brazil's problems than u.s. banks and it was difficult to discuss capitalisation with the latter.     a swiss official said the brazilian delegation had made no demands.     funaro, who travels to italy this evening, said it was unclear if he would go to japan on friday or return to brazil first.  reuter &#3;</h3>
