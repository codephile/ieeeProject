	<h3>panhandle eastern corp said it had made steady progress in reducing its natural gas take-or-pay exposure from 4.9 billion dlrs to 1.7 billion dlrs worth of potential claims.     panhandle eastern chairman r.l. o'shields said settlement payments of 247 mln dlrs plus releases and waivers of gas purchase obligations since 1982 had reduced the company's take-or-pay exposure.     "while substantial, we believe the unresolved take-or-pay exposure will remain manageable," he said in a letter to shareholders that appeared in the company's new annual report.     panhandle eastern also said it had budgeted 78 mln dlrs for its 1987 capital spending program, an increase from 65 mln dlrs spent last year. the company said its primary focus of 1987 spending would be to modernize and automate its pipelines for greater efficiency.     houston-based panhandle eastern earned 133.5 mln in 1986 on revenues of 2.0 billion, compared to net income of 113.1 mln on sales of 2.5 billion in 1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
