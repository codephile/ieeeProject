	<h3>a prolonged dry spell has damaged 111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces in the central and southern philippines, agriculture officials said.     they said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of rainfall. they warned of a severe drought if the prevailing conditions continued until next month.     agriculture secretary carlos dominguez said he hoped the losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry spell.     affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice), representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8 mln pesos, department of agriculture reports said.     about 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at 170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.     officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total thus the damage is considered negligible.     in the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.      the philippine coconut authority said coconut production in the major producing region of bicol might drop by 25 pct to 320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. there were no reports of actual damage.  reuter &#3;</h3>
