	<h3>the main road between kampala and the kenya border, uganda's most important trade artery, reopened to civilian traffic on saturday after rebels who closed it on friday disappeared back into the bush, travellers said.     the government's national resistance army (nra) closed the road on friday after the rebel holy spirit movement of priestess alice lakwena reached a village on the road, said. but by the time nra reinforcements arrived the rebels had disappeared into thick forest. the road and a parallel railway line, which closed last weekend, carry 90 pct of uganda's foreign trade to the kenyan port of mombasa.  reuter &#3;</h3>
