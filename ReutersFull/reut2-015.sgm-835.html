	<h3>egypt has cancelled its april 2 tender for 200,000 tonnes of any origin wheat for april 15-30 shipment, trade and egyptian official sources said.     trade sources said the cancellation followed an offer by an egyptian company, islamic corp, at 85.80 dlrs/tonne cost and freight, undercutting other traders' offers of between 93.90 and 94.49 dlrs/tonne.     an egyptian trade official in paris confirmed cancellation of the tender following the islamic corp offer, which he said the government had refused for legal reasons.     the official denied trade reports that the government might have substituted a private deal with islamic corp for the original tender.  reuter &#3;</h3>
