	<h3>negotiations on a new international natural rubber agreement, inra, are approaching the make-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear to be in the balance, delegates said.     manaspas xuto of thailand, chairman of the inra renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues. when the talks began on monday xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week.     the talks are due to last until march 20.     xuto said, "there is nothing concrete yet, but the atmosphere is good." the discussions are expected to continue late into the night, and xuto said he may hold weekend meetings.     delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic.     at present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price (set at 201.66 malaysian/singapore cents a kilo in the current agreement) for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the international natural rubber organisation council.     consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more.     producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure.     delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue -- that of the floor price.     it now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called the "lower indicative price," under certain circumstances.     this means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price, and the "may buy" (or "may sell") and "must buy" or "must sell" levels, without changing the "lower indicative price" -- which is set at 150 malaysian/singapore cents in the current pact.     delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.  reuter &#3;</h3>
