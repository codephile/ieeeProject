	<h3>soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky said today moscow felt "indignation and regret" at what he called "truly hostile statements about the soviet union" made by president reagan.     reagan told reporters yesterday he was ordering a high-level review of security at the u.s. embassy in moscow following a sex-and-spy scandal there and said soviet diplomats would not be allowed to use a new embassy in washington until the u.s. moscow mission was made secure.     petrovsky told reporters it was not accidental that washington had chosen this time, only a week before a scheduled moscow visit by u.s. secretary of state george shultz, to make accusations against the soviet union.     objective conditions existed for improving soviet-u.s. relations. "but it seems that someone in washington fails to appreciate this process and tries to poison the atmosphere," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
