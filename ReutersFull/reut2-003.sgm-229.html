	<h3>a group of brokerage executives with a 25.25 pct stake in the cumulative convertible preferred stock of piezo electric products inc said it will seek two seats on the company's board of directors.     in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, providence securities inc, a providence, r.i. brokerage firm, and two executives said they will seek the seats that opened because of a dividend payment default to preferred holders.     the firm, its president, thomas depetrillo, and its vice president, vincent diguilio, also said they may seek additional representation on the company's board.     the cambridge, mass., research firm defaulted on dividends to preferred holders on january 31, which automatically gives preferred holders the right to elect two directors, the executives said.     the firm and its two executives, who hold a combined 104,500 preferred shares, said they originally bought their stake as an investment, but are also trying to motivate the company into reinstating dividends.     depetrillo said he has proposed that the preferred conversion rate change to 85-to-one from 10-to-one and that dividends be cut to 10 cts a share from 1.10 dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
