	<h3>argentina will tell its creditors it needs an extension of deadlines for payment of capital and interest on its 50 billion dlr foreign debt, industry and foreign trade secretary roberto lavagna told reporters.     "we, the developing countries, are going to insist on the application of contingency clauses, to extend deadlines for the payment of capital as well as interest," he said.     he said this could bring about what he called a possible automatic capitalisation of those parts of debt interest that could not be paid and even the elimination of a portion of the debt.  reuter &#3;</h3>
