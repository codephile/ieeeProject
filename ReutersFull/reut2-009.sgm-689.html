	<h3>treasury secretary james baker declined to comment on whether president reagan would reappoint paul volcker to a third term as chairman of the federal reserve board.     "i spent four years and two weeks in the white house job  refusing to comment on personnel matters," he said in an interview with the cable news network. "i'm not going to change now."     but baker did say volcker has "done a tremendous job" and added they get on "extremely well", both when he was white house chief of staff and during his term at treasury.     when asked whether he differed with volcker on international economic policy, baker said "there's really no difference of opinion between us with respect to these matters."     in other comments, baker said he did not think a tax rise was a good idea and nor did president reagan. but he believed congress would enact some spending cuts. "the minute you say raise taxes, all restraints on spending go by the board."     he once again pointed out that taxes were 19 pct of gnp but spending was at 24 pct, a statistic he used to argue strongly for spending cuts.  reuter &#3;</h3>
