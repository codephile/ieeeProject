	<h3>turnover in the u.k. government bond (gilt) market in february slipped to 81.25 billion stg from january's 83.37 billion, although it was 165 pct higher than the 30.63 billion in february 1986, the stock exchange said.     the stock exchange noted, however, that turnover between bond market-makers through the inter-dealer broker (idb) screen system, as distinct from business with outside clients, has only been included from october 1986, meaning that prior data is not strictly comparable with recent figures.     the contribution to overall february, 1987 volume from idb  business was 43.10 billion stg, against 43.19 in january.     in the 20 trading days of february, the average daily volume of business was 4.06 billion stg, against an average of 3.97 billion in january, which had 21 trading days.     total stock exchange turnover for the month was 116.73 billion stg, marginally higher than the 116.65 billion recorded in january but 129 pct more than the 50.92 billion of february 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
