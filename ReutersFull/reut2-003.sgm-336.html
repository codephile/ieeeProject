	<h3>french maize producers will ask the ec commission to grant permanent maize export rebates following the recent ec/u.s. accord guaranteeing the u.s. an annual export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for spain over four years, the french maize producers association, agpm, said.     the commission has already decided to accord rebates for the export of 500,000 tonnes of french maize, of which rebates for around 100,000 tonnes have been granted.     the request will be made when export certificates have been granted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the agpm said.     the association said that the request would cover exports to all destinations, adding that the soviet union, which has important maize needs, is currently excluded from the list of destination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of french maize.     the u.s. agriculture department has forecast soviet maize imports for the 1986/87 campaign at 4.90 mln tonnes against 10.40 mln in 1985/86.  reuter &#3;</h3>
