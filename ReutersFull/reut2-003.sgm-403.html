	<h3>president reagan signed an order  allowing sales of u.s. nuclear fuel to the european atomic energy community (euratom) to continue for a further year, even though they do not comply with a 1978 u.s. law.     under the law, which is designed to combat the spread of nuclear weapons, foreign importers of u.s. nuclear fuel must get american consent to any reprocessing.     the united states and euratom have had a series of 11 rounds of talks from 1978 to 1986 to renegotiate its nuclear cooperation agreements, signed more than 20 years ago, to conform with the 1978 law.     since 1978 the u.s.-euratom nuclear coooperation accords have been extended by a series of presidential waiver orders.     state department officials said negotiations had made more progress in the last two years after the united states had offered a longterm reprocessing consent arrangement, rather than requiring euratom to have u.s. consent for each fuel delivery.      in notifying congress of today's order extending u.s.-euratom nuclear cooperation, reagan said: "a disruption of nuclear cooperation would not only eliminate any chance of progress in our talks with euratom related to our agreements, it would also cause serious problems in our relationships."       he said further progress in talks with euratom was  expected this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
