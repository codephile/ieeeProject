	<h3>argentina's chief debt negotiator said he was confident of a prompt accord with international creditor banks for rescheduling the country's foreign debt.     "i'm quite optimistic about carrying out a serious and quick negotiation," treasury secretary mario brodersohn said on return from talks in new york with leading u.s. and world financial officials.     argentina is currently negotiating terms with the steering committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet four pct economic growth targets in 1987. it has also asked for a reduction in interest rates and fresh credit.     brodersohn said the growth targets were not negotiable, but argentina did not want to follow brazil in suspending payments on its foreign debt.     he said argentina was seeking 2.15 billion dlrs credit to meet the targets, adding that the banks' attitude had improved following brazil's decision.     the united states and a group of other industrial nations on thursday granted argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge loan.     brodersohn held talks in new york with u.s. treasury secretary james baker, federal reserve chief paul volcker and international monetary fund (imf) head michel camdessus.  reuter &#3;</h3>
