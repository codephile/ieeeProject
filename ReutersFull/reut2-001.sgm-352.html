	<h3>general motors corp said its directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 pct of its 1.66 dlr par value common stock by the end of 1990.     gm said the level of repurchases this year will not exceed 10 mln shares or about three pct of its outstanding stock.     it said the stock repurchase, as market conditions permit, will be funded from a portion of the cash flows generated by reduced capital spending and anticipated performance improvements.     gm also said its board authorized the repurchase of as many as five mln shares each of its class e and class h common, with about half of the proposed repurchases completed by year end.     gm also said it is considering offering an odd-lot repurchase program for its class h stock by mid-year.     gm said the class e and h repurchases would increase participation in the net income of its electronic data systems corp <gme> and hughes electronic corp <gmh> subsidiaries by holders of its 1.66 dlr par value common.     gm also said it anticipates a decrease in automotive capital spending, excluding eds and hughes aircraft co, to 7.9 billion dlrs in 1987 and 5.8 billion dlrs in 1989, from 10.6 billion dlrs in 1986.     it also said improvements in operating performance are expected to amount to 10 billion dlrs annually by 1990.     "we have one overriding objective--to position gm so that it is producing the best products available in an increasingly competitive global marketplace," said chairman roger b. smith.     gm had 319.4 mln shares of its 1.66 dlr par value common outstanding, 53.5 mln shares of class e and 66.6 mln shares of class h outstanding at year end 1986.     gm said that its par value holders currently participate in the 56 pct of the earnings of eds and 67 pct of hughes' earnings.     gm also said it will continue to repurchase shares of all three classes of its common in connection with ongoing requirements of various benefit plans.     that buyback, it said, will involve about nine mln shares of 1.66 dlr par value common and 2.5 mln shares each of class e and h common in 1987.     gm said the repuchased shares of its par value common will be held in its treasury indefinitely for possible future business use.      reuter &#3;</h3>
