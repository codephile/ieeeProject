	<h3>u.s. treasury secretary james baker said any attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major latin american debtor nations might damage the world economy.     in an article in monday's edition of the miami herald, baker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief, calling it a "dramatic, overnight solution."     "while these ideas may be well-intentioned and have some political appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive in the long run," he said.     the article was published to coincide with a three-day meeting here of the inter-american development bank (iadb).     baker is the chief architect of the u.s. strategy on third world debt.     brazil, the third world's largest debtor, last month declared a moratorium on interest repayments. it has given no indication of when it may resume interest payments, prompting fears that some large u.s. banks may be forced into substantial debt writedowns and calling into question the viability of the u.s. strategy.     baker, defending the strategy, said private commercial banks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt since october 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.     "together with expected progress in commercial bank discussions with argentina and, we hope, brazil, this should add up to substantial new lending for the major latin debtors in 1987," baker wrote.     he estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accounted for 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region's major debtor states. such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sell third world debt at a discount to investors who then become stockholders in firms in these countries. "these swaps aren't a panacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market can make progress in reducing the debt burden," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
