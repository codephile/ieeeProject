	<h3>the bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said.     banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on april 22.     the allocation was in line with market expectations the bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires.     call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said.     the excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks.     however major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity.     the call money declines surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the bundesbank disbursed further government funds today. however, most said this had not occurred.     banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion marks in minimum reserves at the bundesbank on friday, up from 49.9 billion on thursday. average daily reserves over the first 20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion. for all of march, banks would be required to hold net daily average reserves of 50.7 billion marks, dealers said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
