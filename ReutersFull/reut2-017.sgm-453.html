	<h3>israel's central bank said in its annual report the country made striking gains in 1986 under an austerity program, but warned a national election campaign could harm the economy.     elections are due by november 1988, but tension within the government over a middle east peace conference has led many political analysts to predict the government may fall earlier.     bank of israel governor michael bruno told a news conference the austerity since july 1985 had balanced the national budget for the first time in 15 years, and pushed inflation from 400 pct a year to just below 20 pct in 1986.     but bruno warned that if politicians followed their past practice of lifting customs duties and increasing government subsidies on basic goods in order to curry public favour during elections, the gains of the program could be lost.     "the great success of the national unity government in executing the economic programme ... depends on its ability to show proper judgement towards economic issues also when elections are on the horizon," bruno said.     he blamed a 12 pct rise in real wages in 1986 for a sharp increase in private consumption, and said higher pay was harming attempts to push inflation to under 10 pct a year.     "the lowering of inflation was one of the striking successes of 1986," bruno said.     "it is important to note that in this area of economic stability we still have to tread a delicate path to reach an annualised inflation rate of 10 pct in the second half of this year," he said. he added that this was achievable.     the bank's report said israel's gross domestic product grew by 2.2 pct in 1986. the business gdp, which most economists view as a better indicator of economic growth, rose by 3.7 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
