	<h3>a federal judge heard arguments that manville corp's chapter 11 reorganization plan, which was confirmed in december, should be thrown out.     during a four-and-a-half hour hearing, u.s. district judge whitman knapp heard arguments in five different appeals. whitman took the issues under advisement and will rule at a later date.     key challenges were made by a group of manville shareholders, who claim they were not adequately represented during the bankruptcy proceedings and that a 2.5 billion dlr fund to pay victims of asbestos is overfunded.         another challenge came from a group of asbestos victims who claimed the trust fund was underfunded.     today, manville lawyers said there have been about 54,000 claims filed by those injured by asbestos.     the reorganization plan also sets up a trust fund, with initial funding of 125 mln dlrs, to pay for property damage claims. additional funds will be available if needed. manville said there are currently 9,500 property damage claims filed.     manville filed for bankruptcy in 1982 and its reorganization plan was approved by all parties except the common stockholders.         the stockholders objected to the proposal because it would greatly dilute the value of their holdings. the plan would have the effect of converting every eight shares of common stock into just one share.     manville lawyers today criticized shareholder groups for further delaying the execution of the bankruptcy plan. herbert edelman, one of manville's lawyers, pointed out that many thousands of victims and creditors were still awaiting payments and that many victims had already died.     he also pointed out that the bankruptcy court had found manville to be insolvent.     "they (shareholders) want the plan put aside to get that nebulous value that may be down the road," edelman said.     common shareholders claim they were not adequately represented because u.s. bankruptcy judge burton lifland refused requests to divide the equity holders committee into two separate groups, one repesenting common shareholders and the other preferred stock shareholders.     during confirmation hearings of the plan, the equity committee's lawyer george hahn walked out of the hearing, saying he could not represent both groups.     the equity holders committee was then abolished.         an unofficial committee representing 10 pct of the company's stock was present at the confirmation hearings. however, lawyers for that committee did not present evidence or cross examine witnesses.     during today's hearing paul gonson, a washington lawyer representing the securities and exchange commission, told judge knapp that the agency was also concerned that the shareholders did not have adequate representation.     knapp said the unofficial committee was represented by the new york law firm of kronish, lieb, weiner and hellman. "they have one of the best law firms in town," knapp said.   reuter &#3;</h3>
