	<h3>treasury secretary james baker, facing the toughest challenge to his third world debt plan so far, is expected today to stoutly defend the strategy.      at an opening address to the annual meeting of the inter-american development bank here baker is likely once again to bluntly reject alternative approaches like wholesale debt relief.      the speech comes after washington delayed its bid to wrest control of iadb lending from latin nations.      the treasury secretary is also expected, u.s. officials say, to portray that attempt as a crucial element in his plan to promote inflation-free economic growth, open markets, and a much-reduced government role in the economies of latin america.      "we have already seen substantial progress," baker said in a miami herald article and argued the plan was never meant to be a "quick fix".      but brazil, ecuador, peru, nicaragua and bolivia have all ceased servicing some or all of their debt. brazil's interest payments moratorium, announced last month, is being seen as a major challenge to the baker plan.      owing foreigners 109 billion dlrs, brazil called an indefinite interest payments moratorium on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt.      brazilian central banker francisco gros met bankers last night to begin what u.s. officials predict will be months of extremely tough negotiations.      the scale of the problem is immense. owing some 382 billion dlrs of foreign debt, latin nations have since the start of the decade paid out some  200 billion dlrs in interest and principal and received about 28 billion dlrs in new loans.      in addition, upwards of 100 billion dlrs in capital flight is estimated to have left the region during that time.      the baker plan, unveiled in october, 1985, calls on commercial and multilateral banks to increase lending by about 29 billion dlrs in the three subsequent years to the 15 major debtors engaging in fundamental economic reform.      the theory runs that once a debtor nation has reformed its economy, it can service its debt comfortably and without an atmosphere of crisis.      u.s. officials emphasize some 8.5 billion dlrs has been paid out in the first 14 months of the plan, payments of over 70 billion dlrs of debt has been stretched out into the future  and washington  is embracing new and innovative ideas to keep debtor-creditor negotiations afloat.      baker is expected to underscore these points in his address today.  reuter &#3;</h3>
