	<h3>trade between argentina and brazil jumped 90 pct in 1986 versus 1985, foreign minister dante caputo said.     speaking to reporters, caputo said the near doubling in trade showed the "tangible and immediate results" of a wide- ranging economic integration accord signed by the presidents of both countries last july.     he said trade last year totalled 1.3 billion dlrs versus 700 mln dlrs in 1985.     the accord provided for capital goods trade between the two countries to rise to 2.0 billion dlrs over four years.     argentine wheat exports to brazil will increase from 1,375,000 tonnes in 1987 to 2.0 mln tonnes in 1991, the accord said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
