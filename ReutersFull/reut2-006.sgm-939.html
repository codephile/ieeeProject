	<h3>dismantling agricultural subsidies and implementing international farm policy reform will be the top priorities of the united states at the upcoming venice economic summit, secretary of state george shultz told a group of american farm leaders.     "we want to see the american farmer put in a position in which he can compete on a level playing field," shultz told the board of directors for the national association of wheat growers.     the global agricultural situation is in the midst of the most serious farm crisis in modern history, shultz said, and how the u.s. responds to the current problems will determine whether the u.s. will continue its leadership role in world agriculture.     government policies that subsidize production and exports have created a "crisis of overproduction," he said. shultz particularly criticized european community policies which he said encourage domestic production by providing high government supports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product with the help of huge subsidies.     the u.s. and its trading partners cannot afford to continue current high levels of subsidies, he said. but the u.s. cannot stop subsidies alone, shultz said. "we have to agree to dismantle these systems together," he said.     the u.s., ec and japan have the obligation to take the lead in agricultural reform, he said. for that reason, u.s. officials will push for farm reform at the venice meeting and have made it a top priority for gatt negotiations in geneva.  reuter &#3;</h3>
