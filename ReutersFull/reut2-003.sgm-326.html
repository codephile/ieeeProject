	<h3>carolin mines ltd said recent assays of tailings at its hope, british columbia mine indicated that ounces of gold per ton ranged from 0.64 to 0.50.     there were only trace amounts of platinum and palladium, the company said.     carolin said the results sharply disagreed with an earlier assay performed by intergold u.s.a. inc which showed one ounce of gold per ton and 1/2 ounce of platinum per ton.     carolin also said it expects to receive results of further tests and assays of the tailings within two to three weeks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
