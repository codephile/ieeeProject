	<h3>hard wheat futures closed 1-1/4 to 1/2 cents lower in light trading as exporter selling erased early gains to close the market near session lows, traders said. may closed 1-1/4 cents lower at 2.72-3/4 dlrs.     prices opened steady to higher on some follow-through buying from yesterday and hopes for new export sales in tenders scheduled this week. but selling by a major exporter brought prices off their highs, and the lack of strong buying interest reversed those gains.     volume remained generally thin with little other fresh news in the market. cargill sold 1.0 mln bushels of may, and staley bought may and july, pit brokers said. some intra-market spreading was noted with players on both sides of july/december at 7-1/2 cents, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
