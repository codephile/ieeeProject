	<h3>joseph harrosh, a fremont, calif., investor with a 5.6 pct in bethlehem steel corp preferred stock, said he intends to seek at least one of two board seats which may open should bethlehem delay dividend payments.     in a handwritten filing with the securities and exchange commission, harrosh said he would seek the board seat if betheleham steel falls six quarters behind in its dividend payments to preferred holders.     a six-quarter dividend delay would open two board seats which would be filled by preferred holders.     harrosh reported he has 139,300 shares of bethlehem's five dlr cumulative convertible preferred stock.  reuter &#3;</h3>
