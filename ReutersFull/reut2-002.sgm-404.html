	<h3>combined international corp should have another strong year, president patrick g. ryan told analysts, although he declined to forecast earnings specifically.     in 1986, the company reported operating income of 5.51 dlrs a share, up from 4.84 dlrs a share a year earlier. revenues increased to 1.81 billion dlrs from 1.36 billion dlrs.     ryan said combined is testing a direct response long-term care product through its union fidelity life insurance co and has plans to offer it through ryan insurance group.     in answer to a question on combined's possible exposure to aids-related health claims, ryan said it was "minimal" although he conceded that every carrier who provides coverage is vulnerable.  reuter &#3;</h3>
