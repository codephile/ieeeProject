	<h3>talks on coffee export quotas at the international coffee organization (ico) special council session will resume at noon gmt today, following a last minute decision taken early this morning to extend the meeting 24 hours, ico officials said.     an 18 member contact group will meet at midday to examine new ideas, and the full council is to convene at 1900gmt, they said.     the extension resulted from a last ditch effort by colombia to salvage the talks, which by late yesterday looked perilously close to ending without agreement on quotas, delegates said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
