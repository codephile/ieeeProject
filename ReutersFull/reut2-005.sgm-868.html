	<h3>while most of the world's financial markets will be monitoring the u.k. budget, traders and analysts in the u.s. credit market will be pouring over latest housing starts data for fresh clues about current and future domestic growth trends, economists said.     most economists expect the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate to ease to about 1.75 mln units in february from just under 1.81 mln in both january and december.     "the level of housing starts is likely to have declined modestly but still have remained at a relatively high level," said peter greenbaum of smith barney, harris upham and co inc.     unfortunately, meaningful comparisons between february's and prior months' underlying trends may prove difficult.     "caution should be used when interpreting (december's and january's) increase," cautioned smith barney's greenbaum.     "although underlying fundamentals remain strong -- mortgage rate stability, healthy income gains -- warmer than usual weather undoubtedly also had some influence in pushing starts higher in both months," he added.     economists at shearson lehman brothers inc were more succinct in a weekly newsletter: "a slight decline across the board, no particular economic reason, mostly weather."     charles lieberman of manufacturers hanover securities corp said single-family homes would account for most of the housing starts drop although smith barney's greenbaum saw signs of stabilization in both the single- and multi-family sectors.     u.s. treasury secretary james baker is also due to appear before a congressional committee tuesday morning.     federal funds are expected to open at 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 pct after being quoted at 6-3/16 late yesterday.     u.s. government securities prices continued to drift aimlessly yesterday, with the key 7-1/2 pct 30-year treasury bond closing 7/32 lower at 99-25/32.   reuter &#3;</h3>
