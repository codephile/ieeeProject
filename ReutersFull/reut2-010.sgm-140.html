	<h3>the federal securities and exchange commission (sec) proposed new rules that would require accounting firms that audit public companies to submit to a periodic outside review of their operations.     the sec voted unanimously to seek public comment on the plan, under which an accounting firm would have to hire another firm to conduct a so-called "peer review" every three years or lose the right to audit public companies.     sec officials conceded peer review would not end all audit failures but said they hoped it would eliminate audits by clearly unqualified firms and individuals.     "peer review will not stop all bad audits; we recognize that," sec chief accountant clarence sampson told the five sec commissioners.     "but we hope the rule will go far to eliminate audits performed by individuals without the necessary skills to conduct a proper audit," sampson said.     the move is largely symbolic, since firms and individuals responsible for auditing 84 pct of all public companies already voluntarily undergo peer review every three years, under an accounting industry self-regulatory plan.     but the sec has been under pressure for years from some federal lawmakers to make the accounting industry more open and accountable to the public.     agency officials estimated that a peer review would cost the average accounting firm between 1,500 and 2,500 dlrs, or 500 to 750 dlrs a year.     "i don't think that (cost) is a dispositive issue," sec chairman john shad said. "it's within a reasonable range of cost."     the proposal would exempt foreign auditors of non-u.s. companies required to file financial reports with the sec.  reuter &#3;</h3>
