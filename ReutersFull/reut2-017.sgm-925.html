	<h3>the united arab emirates (uae) recorded a 1986 trade surplus of 12.2 billion dirhams, narrowing from 30.2 billion in 1985, the central bank's latest bulletin shows.     the central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to the decline in the value of exports and reexports to 37.2 billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985. this reflected the decline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing uae oil, the central bank added.     the surplus on the current account narrowed to 6.8 billion dirhams from 25.5 billion in 1985. the overall balance showed a surplus of 4.8 billion after 2.6 billion in 1985.  reuter &#3;</h3>
