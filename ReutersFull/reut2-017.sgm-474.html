	<h3><british airport services ltd> (bas) has concluded an 18 mln yen contract with the <kansai international airport co ltd> for consulting work on the terminal at a new airport to be built in western japan, the airport company said in a statement.     the contract is the first to be awarded to a british company and follows the award of a 200,000 dlr consultancy contract to a division of the u.s-based <bechtel international corp> in consortium with six japanese companies, a company spokesman told reuters. bas is a subsidiary of <baa plc>, the former british airports authority.     the six-billion dlr project to build the airport has been a major source of friction with the u.s. and the european community who have put pressure on japan to allow foreign companies to compete with domestic firms in building it.  reuter &#3;</h3>
