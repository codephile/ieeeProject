	<h3>state-run tanzania railway corporation (trc) has secured 25.6 mln dlrs aid from banks and european countries for a one-year emergency repair program, transport minister mustafa nyang'anyi said.     nyang'anyi told reuters on his return from a world bank sponsored donors' conference in new york that the aid would enable trc to buy spares for 32 locomotives, overhaul 800 wagons and replace 67,000 sleepers over the next 12 months.     the world bank, african development bank, european community, canada, belgium, west germany, britain, sweden, italy and denmark had contributed to the package, he said.     trc runs a rail network linking dar es salaam and the northern port of tanga with the coffee-growing area around mount kilimanjaro and ports on lake victoria and lake tanganyika.     it is under separate administration from the tanzania-zambia railway linking dar es salaam with the zambian copperbelt and the railway system of southern africa, which has already received substantial aid as part of international efforts to ease the dependence of landlocked african states on trade routes through south africa.     but this is the first international aid package for trc, which also carries cargo for uganda, zaire and burundi.  reuter &#3;</h3>
