	<h3>a split in the thai government's main coalition party may prompt prime minister prem tinsulanonda to dissolve parliament soon, interior minister prachuab suntharangun said.     he told reporters that prem was considering new elections because squabbling in the democrat party undermined government performance and held up legislation prem wanted passed.     but prem was reluctant to call new elections or reshuffle his cabinet because that too would be likely to result in a wobbly multi-party coalition, prachuab said. he declined to say how soon parliament might be dissolved.     the democrats, one of four parties in the ruling coalition, have been split ever since winning 100 of the parliament's 347 seats in elections in july 1986.     the current coalition was formed last august and constitutes a hefty parliamentary majority. but the democrats' inability to work well together or with their coalition partners has made the government vulnerable to the small but more cohesive opposition.     parliament closed the first of its two annual sessions this month and is scheduled to reconvene in september.  reuter &#3;</h3>
