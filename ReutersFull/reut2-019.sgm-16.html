	<h3>finance minister michael wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.     "responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible," wilson said in a speech prepared for the house of commons.     wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending march 31, 1988, the same level as he forecast in the february budget.     and in the year ended this past march, the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, wilson said.     wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues.     but finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system.     the deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991.     wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the canadian economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. in 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct.     inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years.  reuter &#3;</h3>
