	<h3><cambrian and general securities plc> said the london stock exchange has restored the listing of its 50 mln dlrs of secured floating rate notes dated 1992 at the company's request.     the notes are fully secured and therefore have a prior claim over cambrian's assets in the event of other claims arising from litigation, it added.     dealings in cambrian's securities have been suspended since late 1986 following the disclosure of insider trading activities by former chairman ivan boesky. cambrian officials were not immediately available for further comment on today's statement.  reuter &#3;</h3>
