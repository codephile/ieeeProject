	<h3>transportation secretary elizabeth dole said she was cautiously optimistic the senate would sustain president reagan's veto of an 88 billion dlr highway bill today.     "i believe that there will be the votes to sustain the president's veto," she said on nbc's "today" program.     but she added, "whether or not the president wins on this particular issue he is a winner because he has stood up for fiscal responsibility."     the house voted 350-73 yesterday to override reagan's veto but the bill dies unless the senate also votes by more than two-thirds to override the veto and enact the bill into law.  reuter &#3;</h3>
