	<h3>president leon febres cordero said ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for ecuador to meet its commitments.     ecuador yesterday said last week's earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt.     "all legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the president said during a visit to the quake zone. "a government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."     he said he had previously held that ecuador was obliged to make debt payments when crude oil was at 26 dlrs a barrel because the government had projected plans with crude prices at that level.     private foreign banks and the world bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for quito to be able to meet its commitments, febres cordero said.     he added that ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.  reuter &#3;</h3>
