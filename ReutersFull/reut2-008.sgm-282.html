	<h3>the commerce department published revisions to monthly data on factory orders indicating some substantial changes to published figures for recent months.     the revisions take account of several factors including adjustments to unfilled orders levels, recalculation of new orders estimates and updating of seasonal adjustment factors, the department said.     as a result, december factory orders reported as rising 1.6 pct rose on the revised basis by 3.2 pct, while november orders reported as 3.6 pct were up only 0.8 pct on the revised basis, the department said.     commerce has already reported january factory orders fell 4.0 pct. the report on february orders is due next week and that figure will be revised then.     the revisions, which cover the years 1982-1986, also affect the key category of durable goods orders. the department said durables orders reported as 1.5 pct higher in december were up 5.3 pct on the revised basis and november orders reported 5.1 pct higher were up a revised 3.0 pct.     the department reported january durable goods orders fell 7.5 pct and is scheduled to release february orders on tuesday morning.     the january durable goods orders will be revised and february orders reported on a basis consistent with the revisions, commerce said.     for all of 1986, factory orders were originally reported as being unchanged from 1985 levels, but the department said after revisions orders fell 0.6 pct last year.     among changes in the orders survey, the department said it was changing inventory values to reflect current costs rather than book value of unsold goods.  reuter &#3;</h3>
