	<h3>the inflow of long-term capital into west germany slumped to 606 mln marks in february from january's record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases of german bonds and shares declining sharply, the bundesbank said.     while foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of german bonds in february after 13 billion in january, they sold a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public authorities after sales worth 300 mln in january.     with german investors' purchases of foreign securities steady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks were imported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.     direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60 billion marks in february after 2.83 billion in january.     there was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in january.     banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets abroad by 700 mln. but public authorities received some one billion marks from abroad, the bundesbank said in a statement.     combining long and short term capital outflows, west germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in february against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in january.     the bundesbank confirmed the german trade surplus widened to 10.45 billion marks in february from january's 7.20 billion.     taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. in terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of the surplus was progressing, the bank said.     germany's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion marks in february from 4.79 billion in january, but was down on the 7.26 billion figure for february 1986. seasonally adjusted, the february current account surplus narrowed against january.     while exports in february fell a half pct against the same month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the drop in prices. exports grew three pct in volume and imports two pct.     in the balance of services, a fall in net investment income led to a 300 mln mark deficit in february after a 300 mln mark surplus in january.     the deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3 billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the european community budget.  reuter &#3;</h3>
