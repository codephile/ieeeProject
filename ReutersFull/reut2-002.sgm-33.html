	<h3>iraq said its forces killed or wounded 15,000 iranian revolutionary guards as they crushed a new iranian offensive near the strategic port city of basra.     a high command war communique said four revolutionary guards divisions attacked iraqi positions east of basra on the gulf war southern front, but they were fully crushed by noon (0900 gmt).     adbul-jabbar mohsen, chief of the defence ministry political department, said the iranians had 15,000 casualties.     iran earlier today said its forces launched fresh attacks near basra last night, adding that 1,200 iraqis were killed or wounded in fighting near fish lake, 10 km east of basra.     in its first reaction to tehran reports of a new iranian offensive on the northern front, iraq said fighting continues around the strategic mountain peak of kardamanend, overlooking the haj omran-rawandiz axis close to the iranian border.     a military spokesman said iran launched its attack in the north "to (turn) iraqi attention towards that area and relax pressure in the south."     he added, "iraq knows well that iran's main goal is to occupy basra in the south and that was the reason why iraq has repelled their new offensive so decisively and firmly."     iran reported heavy fighting on both fronts today.  reuter &#3;</h3>
