	<h3>a specially convened franco-german meeting in the sidelines of a summit of ec leaders failed to make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has deeply split the two former ec allies, diplomats said     the meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign ministers from both countries and by french president francois mitterand, his prime minister jacques chirac, and by chancellor helmut kohl of west germany.     the stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the community's worst-ever budget crisis.     "the germans clearly do not want to budge," an aide to chirac told reporters. he added the french prime minister was visibly angered as he the hour-long meeting.     bonn and paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the brussels executive commission to overhaul radically the ec's complex "green" currrency system, designed to translate common ec farm prices into national currencies.     paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which west germany is against, along with britain, denmark and the netherlands.     ec farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package, which should have been agreed by an april 1 deadline tomorrow.     diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks.     the commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the ec's ever-rising farm budget.     the summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987.  reuter &#3;</h3>
