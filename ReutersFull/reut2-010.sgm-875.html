	<h3>the united states does not expect the executive board meeting of the international coffee organization, ico, to call for a new round of negotiations on reinstating coffee quotas, a u.s. government official said.     the official, a member of the u.s. delegation to ico talks earlier this year, said no new coffee agreement talks are expected because there is no indication the negotiating positions of major producers and consumers have changed.     the u.s. still demands, as a condition of reimposition of coffee quotas, that "objective criteria" be set for establishing quotas, said the u.s. official, who asked not to be identified. brazil, the major producer, insists on quotas based on a traditional formula.     the u.s. remains open to a negotiating meeting but only if some new flexibility is apparent from major countries, the official said.     the ico executive board meets tomorrow in london.  reuter &#3;</h3>
