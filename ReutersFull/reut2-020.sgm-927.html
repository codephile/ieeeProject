	<h3>president reagan is concerned about the record drop in stock prices but remains convinced on the basis of administration talks with financial experts that the economy remains sound, the white house said.     white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in a written statement that reagan "watched today with concern" the decline on wall street, where the dow jones industrial average plunged more than 500 points.     the statement said reagan had directed administration officials to consult with leading financial experts, including the chairmen of the federal reserve, the securities and exchance commission, and the new york stock exchange.     "these consultations confirm our view that the underlying economy remains sound," fitzwater said.     the white house statement, issued about 45 minutes after the stock market closed, appeared designed to calm investors worried about u.s. economic propects.     "we are in the longest peacetime expansion in history. employment is at the highest level ever. manufacturing output is up. the trade deficit, when adjusted for changes in currencies, is steadily improving. and, as the chairman of the federal reserve board has recently stated, there is no evidence of a resurgence of inflation in the united states," fitzwater said.         he said reagan was keeping close watch on the markets in the united states and in countries, where waves of selling developed on monday.     "we will continue to closely monitor these developments," fitzwater said.     however, his three-paragraph statement gave no hint of what, if any, action reagan might take if the stock market plunge continues.     the percentage drop of 22.6 percent on monday was the second largest ever, exceeded only by the 24.4 percent drop on dec. 12, 1914.         it easily eclipsed the fall of 12.8 percent on oct. 28, 1929 which helped spark the great depression.     reagan and his top advisers discussed the market crisis, which came on the same day american naval forces retaliated for last friday's alleged iranian missile attack on a u.s. flagged kuwaiti tanker in the gulf, at a white house issues luncheon.     presidential aides told reporters after the luncheon an official statement was likely to be issued when the markets closed.  reuter &#3;</h3>
