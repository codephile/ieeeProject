	<h3>deputy prime minister janez zemljaric, speaking before a meeting with the paris club of creditor nations, said yugoslavia was seeking to refinance two billion dlrs of debt.     the official tanjug news agency quoted zemljaric as saying yugoslavia expected a "definite measure of understanding" from 16 western creditor countries when they meet on march 30.     zemljaric was not quoted as saying whether the two billion dlrs referred to principal or interest or both. yugoslavia's hard currency debt stands between 19 and 20 billion dlrs.     zemljaric said the international monetary fund criticised yugoslavia for not regulating consumption, not having real interest rates or market exchange rates, for its inability to control monetary policy and slow pace of reform.     he said the criticisms were in a report by an imf commission which visited yugoslavia last december and january.     "we cannot accept this assessment because we have made not inconsiderable progress under difficult conditions, even though we are aware of our own weaknesses," zemljaric said.     he said the report favourably assessed some trends in the yugoslav economy but did not say which.     milos milosavljevic, also a deputy prime minister, said last friday that yugoslavia had repaid 640 mln dlrs of principal and 325 mln dlrs of interest so far in 1987.     according to official yugoslav figures, yugoslavia repaid a record 5.97 billion dlrs in capital and interest in 1986.     in an interview with the west german weekly magazine der spiegel, prime minister branko mikulic said last weekend yugoslavia had repaid 28.3 billion dlrs in principal and interest between 1981 and 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
