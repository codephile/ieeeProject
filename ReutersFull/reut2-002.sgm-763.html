	<h3>the world's major copper producing and consuming countries have reached "a degree of consensus" on objectives and functions of a future study group aimed at reviewing the world copper market, officials said.     governments represented at a meeting to consider a proposed forum for copper have recommended that another session be held in september to consider further the nature of such a group, a spokesman for the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad) said.     the one-week meeting, which ended today, was held to examine a u.s. initiative to set up a copper study group.     the new body would not aim at negotiating measures to stabilise depressed world prices.     its objectives would include increasing market transparency, through improved statistics, and undertaking activities aimed at developing the copper market and contributing to improvement of demand.     unctad's spokesman said, "once they have agreed on detailed functions and objectives, then the way will be cleared to setting up the body."  reuter &#3;</h3>
