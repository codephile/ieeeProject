	<h3>indonesia cannot spend its way out of recession and has very limited economic options due to lower world oil prices, central bank governor arifin siregar was quoted as saying by the official antara news agency.     "if indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such as through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it might create negative effects not only on price increases, but also on the balance of payments," he told bankers and businessmen in the north sumatran city of medan.     antara quoted him as saying indonesia is relying on its export drive to help narrow its trade deficit.     antara reported that siregar said the government wanted to help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries, which are centered in sumatra.     "i see sumatra has great potential, as in the plantation sector in which family units are employed in great number," he said, according to the agency.     indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of its export revenue until last year's fall in crude prices.     it has projected its current account deficit will widen to over four billion dlrs in the current financial year ending march 31 from 1.8 billion in 1985/86.  reuter &#3;</h3>
