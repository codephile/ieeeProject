	<h3>the philippine government has quietly agreed to make token payments of principal in each of the next three years as part of its 10.3 billion dlr commercial bank debt rescheduling package finalized last friday, bankers said.     manila will pay foreign banks 37 mln dlrs a year in 1987, 1988 and 1989, representing four pct of a 925 mln dlr loan signed in 1985. amortizations on the loan were not due to begin until 1990, but the philippines agreed to make the extra 111 mln dlr prepayment in order to win a relatively low interest margin of 7/8 pct over eurodollar rates, bankers said.     bankers said they insisted on the principal repayments so that they could justify a margin of 7/8 pct by drawing a direct parallel between the philippines and venezuela, which won a 7/8 pct spread on a 21 billion dlr debt rescheduling package last month.     after the venezuelan deal was clinched, leading new york bankers hurried to argue that 7/8 pct was the new benchmark spread for a debtor nation that was current on interest, was not seeking new money and was amortizing loan principal.     previously, the 13/16 pct margin granted to mexico was seen by debtors as the margin to strive for.     the philippines, which met the first two venezuelan criteria but not the third, was adamant that it could not accept a spread higher than 7/8 pct.     bankers could not back down either because they would have had to sacrifice millions of dollars in profits and may have thrown the door open to other debtors, notably argentina and brazil, to claim even finer spreads than mexico's.     in the end, the compromise saved face for the banks. "the banks were agonizing how to reconcile this package with venezuela's. this allowed them to walk out and say, we've kept faith with the venezuelan precedent," one source said.     the prepayments, although modest, were not apparently something that the philippine negotiators wanted to dwell upon as they sought to portray their 17-year rescheduling agreement as better than mexico's.     finance minister jaime ongpin did not refer to the prepayments at a news conference he held in new york on friday to announce the rescheduling agreement.     and an accompanying press release referred only obliquely to the fact that the 7/8 pct margin will increase to one pct "as long as the philippines pays amortizations as agreed with the banks."     the threat of a higher margin gives the philippines every incentive to make the extra payments, and the government has indicated that it will in fact do so, bankers said.     furthermore, by paying back ahead of schedule some of the last loan it raised, the philippines will be hoping to make a good impression on the international banking community.     ongpin said the country should not have a financing gap before the end of next year at the earliest, depending on the success of the philippine investment note issues which are planned, but some bankers say they are already braced for new loan requests for 1988 and 1989.  reuter &#3;</h3>
