	<h3>west german banking authorities are considering requiring german banks to bring securities holdings into lending ratio calculations used to regulate credit risk, banking sources said.     the present interpretation of the credit law limits banks' maximum lending to 18 times eligible capital -- reserves plus equity capital -- but sets no restraints on securities holdings.     under new provisions, weightings would be attached to securities similar to those used for lending. weightings would range from a zero rating for no-risk assets to 100 pct of total asset value for what authorities consider the highest risk.     low-risk securities carrying a zero rating would include public authority bonds for the federal government, states and municipalities, the sources said.     a 20 pct rating would be assigned to issues of domestic banks. secured bonds of mortgage, shipping and public authority banks would be an exception to this, via such securities as mortgage and municipal bonds.     securities issued by foreign banks would attract a weighting of 50 pct, while authorities are considering requiring banks to include 100 pct of the value of debt assets of foreign issuers, including sovereign borrowers.     the sources said the revision is still being discussed, and required approval by the federal banking supervisory office in west berlin, the bundesbank, and west germany's four banking associations.     the move is a response to the increasing securitisation of debt markets, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
