	<h3>senator richard lugar of indiana, ranking republican on the u.s. senate agriculture committee, has not decided whether to introduce an administration-backed bill to apply the so-called 0/92 provision to 1988 through 1990 grain crops, an aide to the senator said.     the reagan administration has asked lugar to offer the measure, the aide said.     however, a number of farm groups have told lugar they oppose the proposal on the grounds it would reopen the 1985 farm bill, and the senator has decided to take a second look at the proposal, the aide said.     last week the aide indicated lugar was planning to offer the 0/92 measure and a bill to tighten a payment limitation loophole.  reuter &#3;</h3>
