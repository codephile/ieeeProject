	<h3>greece and turkey's nato allies today called on both countries to avoid any action that could aggravate an explosive situation in the aegean and "avoid recourse to force at all costs."     after an emergency meeting of nato ambassadors, a statement was issued saying "the present situation damages the interests of greece and turkey, and of the alliance as a whole."     secretary-general lord carrington also offered himself as a mediator in the dispute on the western alliance's southern flank.     the meeting was called after reports that warships of both countries were sailing towards a disputed oil exploration zone of the aegean.     the statement said the tensions in the area had reached a serious level and called on both countries to begin immediate discussions. "any intensification would make things worse," it added.     no attempt was made at the meeting to resolve the complex dispute which was aimed at damage-limitation. carrington said, "i am of course anxious to help in any way i can, provided that both greece and turkey, and the other allies, wish me to do so."  reuter &#3;</h3>
