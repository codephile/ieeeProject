	<h3>libyan forces appear to be withdrawing from their last stronghold in chad after suffering defeats at the hands of french-backed government troops, according to officials in both the u.s. and france.     in washington, a state department spokesman told reporters "we have no reason to doubt that libyan forces are leaving faya largeau," libya's main garrison in chad.     the french defence ministry said it could not confirm the departure of the libyan troops, but an official said "it is extremely likely. they are deprived of air cover and supplies, and their morale must be zero."  reuter &#3;</h3>
