	<h3>piedmont aviation inc said its board meeting recessed today without taking action on proposals to combine piedmont with other corporations.     piedmont has received opposing bids from norfolk southern corp and us air corp.     earlier today, trans world airlines inc offered to either buy piedmont suitor us air or, alternatively, to merge with piedmont and u.s. air.     in a prepared statement, piedmont said there would be no further announcements concerning this situation today.     the company declined to say when the board would meet again.      reuter &#3;</h3>
