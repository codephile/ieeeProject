	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it may downgrade ecolab inc's 10 mln dlrs of bbb-plus subordinated debt.     the agency cited ecolab's proposed acquisition of chemlawn corp <chem> for 370 mln dlr. s and p said there are uncertain returns on such a large investment for ecolab as well as increased credit risk, with debt leverage rising to more than 60 pct from 25 pct currently.     but s and p noted that the acquisition would broaden ecolab's services. s and p said it would review management's plans to sell assets and use proceeds to reduce debt.  reuter &#3;</h3>
