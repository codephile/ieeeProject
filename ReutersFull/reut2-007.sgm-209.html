	<h3>moody's investors service inc said it downgraded the ratings on six billion dlrs of debt of merrill lynch and co inc.     cut were the firm's senior debt, eurodebt and senior guaranteed eurodebt to a-1 from aa-3 and subordinated debt to a-2 from a-1.     merrill's prime-1 commercial paper was not under review.     moody's said that while merrill's absolute earnings would continue to increase, the house's profitability will lag that of its peers. and merrill's attempts to improve profitability will be constrained by accelerating competition, moody's said.     moody's also said merrill lynch would continue to aggressively commit its capital to such merchant banking activities as bridge financing.     "these activities elevate the risk content of merrill's balance sheet at the same time as low profitability inhibits the strong internal capital generation which may be necessary to support business expansion efforts," moody's said.     the rating agency noted, however, that merrill's franchise retains significant value and gives the firm strong proprietary securities placement power.  reuter &#3;</h3>
