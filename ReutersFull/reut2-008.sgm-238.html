	<h3>representatives from nigeria are meeting today and tomorrow with officials of britain's export credits guarantee department (ecgd) in the first of what could be a series of bilateral talks to reschedule nigeria's official debts, banking sources said.     the talks follow an agreement reached between nigeria and the paris club of western creditor governments in december to reschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between september, 1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace. nigeria's official debts to the u.k., its major trading partner, are estimated at 2.5 to three billion dlrs.     if the talks prove successful, the nigerian team, headed by finance minister che okongwu and central bank governor abdulkadir ahmed, will hold similar talks with french export credit officials in paris later this week, the sources said.     an agreement could pave the way for ecgd to resume insurance cover for exports to nigeria, which was suspended in 1983.     the rescheduling of nigeria's official debts was one of the demands required under a rescheduling of part of the country's estimated 19 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, for which agreement also was reached in december between nigeria and a steering committee representing the commercial banks.     the commercial bank rescheduling has yet to be finalised because of the reluctance of japanese banks to participate in the agreement, despite a recent trip to japan by senior nigerian officials and representatives of the steering committee.     the entire package also is being held up because of the need to reach an agreement to satisfy arrears due on short-term insured and uninsured debts. however, bankers are hopeful that an accord will be struck by may 31.     the nigerians also are attempting to reconcile creditors' claims with their own receipts on some two billion dlrs of letters of credit contained in the commercial bank rescheduling.     bankers said that it was hoped that the ecgd would resume cover fairly soon as this could encourage other official creditors to begin bi-lateral talks as well.     under the structural adjustment program supporting the debt reschedulings nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export credits this year from official export credit agencies.     british exports to nigeria were 565 mln stg in 1986, down from 960 mln in 1985, while nigeria's exports to britain, which do not include oil, were 328 mln stg and 647 mln, respectively.  reuter &#3;</h3>
