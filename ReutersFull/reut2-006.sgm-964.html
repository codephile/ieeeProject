	<h3>sweden's rate of inflation during january has been revised downwards after a fault was made in calculating the figures, the central bureau of statistics said.     the january rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of the previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without explaining how the error arose.     consumer prices in february rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1 pct in february last year, the bureau said. the total inflation rate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for january's revised figures, it added.     year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in february, against a revised 3.2 pct in january and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct in february 1986, the bureau said.     the slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government imposed price freeze which came into force on february 4, the bureau added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
