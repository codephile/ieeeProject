	<h3>general mining union corp ltd chairman derek keys cautioned that profits may not rise this year if the rand stays at its current level of 48 u.s. cents.     "we would do well to repeat last year's results if the rand stays depressed," keys said.     the level of the dividend, however, "ought not to be affected," he added, discussing the 1987 outlook.     general mining earlier reported that 1986 per share earnings rose 28 pct to 616 cts.  reuter &#3;</h3>
