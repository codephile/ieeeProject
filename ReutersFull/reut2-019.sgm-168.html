	<h3>there will be no serious bids at european community open market tenders for wheat and barley until ec farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, trade sources said.     the failure of farm ministers this week to come to an agreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the uncertainty remains.     one trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situation will become more serious as time passes.     however, traders said there seem to be few buyers around, lessening the disruptive impact of the delay.     poland and south korea, who are in the market for feed wheat, will be offered intervention grain through special tenders, traders said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
