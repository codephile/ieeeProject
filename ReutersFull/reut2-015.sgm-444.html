	<h3>swedish drug firm ab astra <asts.st> shares rose 48 crowns to 690 in the first two hours of trading on the stockholm bourse, amid hopes its research into anti-viral drugs may have promising results in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids).     stockbrokers said the shares, which climbed amid heavy institutional buying, also rose in reaction to an optimistic assessment of future products in the firm's annual report which was released this week.     brokers enskilda fondkommission said in a report this month that astra was a world leader in anti-viral drugs.     although enskilda said astra had not made any breakthrough in developing a specific drug to treat the acquired immune deficiency syndrome it noted that investors were only now discovering that the firm's approach in the area was promising.     "it is clear that astra has a tradition in anti-viral research which should prove valuable in fighting this disease," the report by enskilda, the investment banking unit of skandinaviska enskilda banken <sebs.st>, said.     company officials could not be reached for comment on the causes of today's share rise.  reuter &#3;</h3>
