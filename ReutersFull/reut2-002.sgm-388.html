	<h3>over 750,000 head of cattle are suffering the effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of a prolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattle producing province of camaguey, the newspaper granma reported.     the province produces 23 pct of cuba's beef and is the island's number two province in milk production. granma said 20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger.     the newspaper said a "cattle emergency" had been decreed and the cattle are being rounded up.     some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar cane conditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleaned before being sent to the mills. the cattle are being fed the residue left after cleaning the cane stalks. 32,000 head have been sent to nearby provinces of las tunas and ciego de avila.     despite cuba's ambitous cattle development plans, beef rationing has been in effect over the past 25 years. in havana, each cuban receives approximately 3/4 lb of rationed beef every 18 days.     in a major area hit by drought, san miguel, practically no rain has fallen in the past 14 months. grazing lands are parched and the region was unable to produce 117,000 tonnes of silage projected in its annual plan.     granma said rainfall over the past year has been less than 50 pct of normal precipitation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
