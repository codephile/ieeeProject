	<h3>brazil will be producing 2.8 mln vehicles a year by the end of this century and it could become the world's third largest national market for motor vehicles, according to a report by the economist magazine's economist intelligence unit.     the report stated that brazil already offered a huge national market for the vehicle producers and offered potential access to other large latin american markets. "development of a fully integrated motor industry in brazil may not be far away," it said. volkswagen, general motors, ford and fiat are all operating modern car plants in brazil now, it added.   "multinationals will want to consolidate and then expand in brazil because of the enormous sourcing opportunities that such a relatively low cost producer offers," the report said.     it pointed out, however, that corporate life in brazil was complicated by its economic situation. "at present brazil is suffering from a debt crisis, rampant inflation and exchange rate fluctuations," the intelligence unit said.     "in spite of this, brazil's resilience is maintained by the potential created by its still under-exploited natural and human resources. the reward for holding out in the present economic climate could be huge," it added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
