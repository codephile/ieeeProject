	<h3>the french government formally abolished rules suspended since last september setting limits on the import and sale of refined oil products from outside the european community.     the rules, introduced in 1979, required importers to buy at least 80 pct of their refined products from european refiners, while at least 90 pct of refined products sold in france were required to come from french or european refiners.     the abolition of the rules, together with a number of relaxations in administrative procedures, was published in the official journal today.     french oil industry officials immediately criticised the move as encouraging imports at a time when french refiners are making heavy losses.     industry figures published in february showed industrywide losses of three billion francs last year after taking into account extraordinary losses on stock depreciation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
