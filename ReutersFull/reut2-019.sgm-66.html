	<h3>isuzu motors ltd <isum.t> forecast a parent company net loss of 15 billion yen in the year ending october 31, 1987 against a 3.98 billion loss a year earlier,  assuming a yen/dollar rate of 140 yen, a spokesman said.     sales in 1986/87 are estimated at 910 billion yen, down 10.2 pct from a year earlier.     the automaker earlier reported a parent company net loss of 12.92 billion in the six months ended april 30, 1987, against a 1.65 billion yen profit a year earlier, on sales of 443.90 billion, down 15.9 pct from a year earlier.     the poor first half performance was due to the yen's rise against the dollar which cut 84.27 billion yen off sales, the spokesman said.     the average yen/dollar rate rose to 158 yen in the first half from 207 a year earlier.     first half car exports fell to 68,445 from 82,093 a year earlier, mainly due to drop in exports to the u.s., while domestic sales rose to 30,643 from 29,836.     truck exports fell to 108,782 from 127,903 because a two-year contract to sell a total of 40,000 trucks to china ended last year and domestic sales fell to 55,925 from 61,954.     the company estimated sales at 207,000 cars in 1986/87, down 5.2 pct from a year earlier, and 339,000 trucks, down 9.8 pct, the spokesman said.     he gave no estimate of exports.  reuter &#3;</h3>
