	<h3>president reagan opposed new taxes as he urged the democratic controlled congress to come up with a budget that meets the gramm-rudman deficit target of 108 billion dlrs for fiscal 1988.     he told reporters before meeting with house republicans in congress that for six years he had proposed a "a sound, solid budget" but alleged that democrats had only come forth with a so-called continuing resolution, a catch-all spending bill, each year.     asked about taxes, he said "they're not going to get those either."     reagan's appearance with republicans coincided with a dispute among house budget committee democrats and republicans. republicans have boycotted budget drafting sessions.     "i'm still trying to get a budget that meets the gramm-rudman target," reagan said. "the democrats have refused to present a budget of their own."     house budget committee chairman william gray told reporters after reagan's remarks that "they (republicans) don't want to participate. the president is up there bashing our brains while republicans won't give us a markup (drafting meeting). it's an interesting combination."  reuter &#3;</h3>
