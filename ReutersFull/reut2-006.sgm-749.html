	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it may downgrade afg industries inc and gencorp inc because a partnership affiliated with afg and wagner and brown made a 2.2 billion dlr tender offer to acquire gencorp.     afg has 185 mln dlrs of bb-plus subordinated debt and gencorp carries 100 mln dlrs of same-rated subordinated debt.     financing terms of the proposed acquisition are unknown, including afg's equity contribution to the partnership. s and p said afg's appetite for substantial acquisitions is aggressive. the tender offer would likely heighten financial risk and increase leverage for gencorp, s and p said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
