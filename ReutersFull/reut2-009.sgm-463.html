	<h3>brazil is preparing a new economic strategy intended to protect domestic growth, finance ministry sources said.     a presidential spokesman said president jose sarney had authorised the government's economic team to prepare the new plan as soon as possible.     finance minister dilson funaro said last night the plan would reflect "an important battle to protect the country's development and keep it from recession."     funaro, who helped lead the anti-inflation cruzado plan launched in february 1986, has come under increasing attack over the past few days following the resignation of planning minister joao sayad on march 17. observers say the plan has failed to stabilise the country's economy.     sayad submitted a new package calling for a 90-day prices and a wage freeze, but met opposition from sarney and funaro.     foreign ministry sources said the new strategy was being prepared by economists persio arida and andre lara resende, both former central bank officials said to have played leading roles in the cruzado plan.    the new plan will define the terms on which brazil will seek rescheduling of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.     on february 20, brazil suspended servicing of 70 billion dlrs of debt to private foreign banks.     funaro said last night brazil wants a rescheduling program spread over four years, and added that it had to include new loans to keep the domestic economy growing.     "in the past two years brazil paid 24 billion dlrs in servicing of its foreign debt, while only getting two billion dlrs in new loans," funaro said.   reuter &#3;</h3>
