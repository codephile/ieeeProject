	<h3>the philippine senate approved a proposal to repay loans owed by a private company to speed up the signing of a 13.2 billion dlr rescheduling agreement with foreign banks.     it concerns a barclays bank managed loan to fertilizer company planter products inc, said teofisto paterno, chairman of the foreign debt committee.     president corazon aquino had accused some creditor banks of "non-too-subtle coercion" in threatening to refuse to sign the rescheduling accord until the loan problem was settled.     over 30 of philippines' 483 creditor banks still have to sign the agreement before the november 15 deadline.  reuter &#3;</h3>
