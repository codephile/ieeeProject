	<h3>santa fe southern pacific corp said it filed a petition asking the u.s. interstate commerce commission to reconsider its earlier rejection of the merger of the holding company's railroad assets.     the icc had rejected in july the merger of the santa fe and southern pacific railroads on the grounds that it would reduce competition.     santa fe in its petition outlines an array of pro-competitive agreements with other railroads which would preserve the economic benefits of the merger for the merged railroad and the public.     if the commission agrees that public benefits and competitive enhancements will result, it can vote to reopen the merger case. interested parties have until march 25 to file statements in response to the supplemental petition.  reuter &#3;</h3>
