	<h3>the home insurance co, a unit of the home group inc, said it is not affected by a may 29 california court ruling that says 20 insurance companies must bear the costs of asbestos-injury claims.     the company said it had reached a settlement agreement with five former asbestos manufacturers that it had insured, prior to the superior court ruling that said insurers, and not asbestos makers, would have to pay the claims from the thousands of victims of asbestos-related illnesses.     home insurance did not disclose the terms of the settlement.         home insurance said it had provided excess coverage to manville corp <qman>, armstrong world industries <ack>, <fibreboard inc>, gaf corp <gaf> and <nicolet inc>.     home insurance said it had been negotiating for the past two years to reach a settlement with the five former asbestos manufacturers to establish the amount of coverage that home insurance would provide in the claims.     the company said the settlement does not impact current or future earnings of the home insurance or its parent, home group, and that it will no longer offer insurance for asbestos-related incidents.      reuter &#3;</h3>
