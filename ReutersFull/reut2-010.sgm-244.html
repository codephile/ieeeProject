	<h3>mcm corp said it has been forced to delay the release of its fourth quarter and yearend results until it can determine the effects on its balance sheet of a possible increase in liabilities at a unit.     earlier this month, the company's occidental fire and casualty co unit paid 26 mln dlrs to a unit of <mutual of omaha> under a commutation agreement.     however, mcm said it now believes it is possible that the unit's liabilities may exceed 26 mln dlrs.     it said a finding on any possible increase should be completed by april 15.  reuter &#3;</h3>
