	<h3>a new york investment partnership seeking control of allegis corp <aeg> disclosed that it has asked the department of transportation to review a 700 mln dlr note agreement allegis has with boeing co <ba>.     citing what it called serious competitive and public interest concerns in the deal, coniston partners, which holds about 13 pct of allegis asked the department to assert its jurisdiction in the matter and require the two companies to seek its approval for the transaction.     in a petition to the department, contained in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, coniston also claims boeing, a major aircraft manufacturer, has obtained control over allegis, parent of united airlines, by virtue of the may 12 deal between the two companies.     under the deal, boeing bought from allegis 700 mln dlrs of convertible notes due may 31, 1992 simultaneously with a 2.1 billion dlr aircraft order united placed with boeing.     coniston said the notes give boeing control over allegis and warned that the relationship between the two companies raises antitrust issues and should be scrutinized closely.     "the world's largest manufacturer of aircraft should not be permitted to acquire control over one of the nation's largest airlines without an opportunity for public comment and fact finding and scrutiny by the regulatory agency having jurisdiction over the air transporation marketplace," coniston said in its petition.     coniston, calling itself the allegis investors group in the petition, said the department should force allegis and boeing to make the required regulatory filings.     coniston is currently seeking control of allegis by winning majority representation on its board of directors.  reuter &#3;</h3>
