	<h3>panhandle eastern corp's trunkline gas co pipeline subsidiary said it is reducing the commodity component of its wholesale natural gas rate four pct, effective immediately.     in a filing with the federal energy regulatory commission, trunkline said, it is reducing its commodity rate -- the portion of the total rate based on the price of gas -- to 2.58 dlrs per mln btu from 2.69 dlrs per mln btu.     the company said the lower rate results from a reduction in the average price the pipeline is paying for gas, adding this reflects contract reformation agreemats with producers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
