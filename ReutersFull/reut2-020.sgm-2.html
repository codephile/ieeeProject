	<h3>the finance ministry will take a wait-and-see stance on tokyo stock exchange movement, although it is gravely concerned about the sharp fall in stock prices, a senior ministry official said.     the official, who declined to be identified, told reporters the 7.3 pct drop in tokyo stock prices this morning was caused primarily by psychological factors following the 22.5 pct fall in new york stock prices overnight.     he said the ministry is in close contact with the tokyo stock exchange, but has no plans yet to take any specific measures regarding the fall.  reuter &#3;</h3>
