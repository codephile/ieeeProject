	<h3>the united states defended its sales of stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism from malaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement with southeast asian producers.     "the united states has continued to abide by the spirit of the memorandum of understanding and has consulted with the asean states on gsa tin disposals," a state department spokesman said in a statement.     "the views of the asean governments have been taken into account in determining disposal levels," the statement said.     the united states and the asean countries signed a memorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by the u.s. general services administration (gsa) in december 1983.     in its latest annual report, the states of malaya chamber of mines said the gsa sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes. "the united states appears to have lost sight of the u.s./asean memorandum of understanding," it said.     the state department statement said gsa tin disposals increased in calendar year 1986 due to changed market conditions. during the first quarter of calendar year 1987, they have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986.     the spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin the gsa sold last year, however.  reuter &#3;</h3>
