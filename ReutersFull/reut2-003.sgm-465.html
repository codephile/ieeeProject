	<h3>nippon oil co ltd <npol.t> predicted parent company net profit of about nine billion yen in the year ending march 31, down 10.4 pct from a year earlier, president yasuoki takeuchi told a press conference.     current profit for the year was estimated at 17 to 18 billion yen, down 20 to 24 pct from a year earlier, he said.     takeuchi said sales are expected to fall 40 pct to 1,700 billion yen for the fifth consecutive year-on-year drop. this year's fall was due to lower selling prices for end-users, which more than offset the yen's appreciation. the company will retain six yen dividend for 1986/87.  reuter &#3;</h3>
