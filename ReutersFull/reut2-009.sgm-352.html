	<h3><rolls-royce ltd> said it signed an agreement with the boeing company <ba.n> to install its rb 211-524 d4d engine on the b767 family of aircraft.     the engine, currently under development, will be ready for service by early 1990, the company said in a statement.     boeing 747s are also powered with the engine, and its use in b767 craft too could bring significant operating benefits, rolls-royce said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
