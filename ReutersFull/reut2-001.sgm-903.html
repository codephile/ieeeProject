	<h3>a group of creditor banks hopes to work out a rescue package for japan line ltd <jlit.t>, one of the world's largest tanker operators, by the end of japan's business year on march 31, a spokesman for the industrial bank of japan ltd <ibjt.t> (ibj) said.     japan line's cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the end of september, which exceeded shareholders' equities and reserves totalling 63.40 billion.     in december, japan line asked banks to shelve repayment of about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries.     japan line said then that the yen's steep rise and the world shipping recession had hit the company hard.     the japanese daily asahi shimbun said today that ibj and three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in loans to japan line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy seven billion yen of new japan line shares.     the spokesman for ibj, japan line's largest creditor, said the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and will be worked out before long.     commenting on the article, he said the details of the package have not yet been settled.  reuter &#3;</h3>
