	<h3>eligible producers of 1986 crop u.s. corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash, the u.s. agriculture department said.     it said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.     only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the gramm-rudman budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.     corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs, respectively, usda said.     the department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments.     deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- september-january.     national weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.     sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate.     the deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law, the department said.     eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in october if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the department said.     the payments will be issued through local agricultural stabilization and conservation service offices, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
