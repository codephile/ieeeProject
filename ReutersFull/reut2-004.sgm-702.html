	<h3>finance minister kiichi miyazawa told a parliamentary session the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the japanese economy.     miyazawa said the paris currency accord among six major industrial nations last month does not necessarily mean the yen should stay stable around current levels in the future.     the paris agreement was aimed at stopping a further rapid fluctuation of exchange rates, he said.     the accord stipulated that current rates reflect fundamentals of the six nations - britain, canada, france, japan, the u.s. and west germany.  reuter &#3;</h3>
