	<h3>the senate defeated a move to block dlrs 40 mln in military aid to the nicaraguan "contra" rebels, virtually assuring the aid will go through.     the 52-to-48 vote was a victory for president reagan, who made the contra program the centerpiece of his central american policy.     the vote virtually guaranteed that 40 mln dlrs -- the final installment of a 100 mln-dlr aid package approved by congress last year -- would reach the rebels fighting the leftist managua government.  reuter &#3;</h3>
