	<h3>u.s. district court judge robert sweet granted requests by federal authorities for court orders freezing the assets of former merrill lynch executive nahum vaskevitch, who has been charged with insider trading.     acting on arguments by the securities and exchange commission, sweet issued a preliminary injunction barring vaskevitch and other defendants in the case from committing further violations of u.s. securities law.     he also issued orders freezing the defendants' u.s. assets, forcing them to give a full accounting of their assets and preventing any alteration or destruction of documents.     the orders merely extend indefinitely the effectiveness of temporary restraining orders the sec obtained against vaskevitch on march 11, when it charged him with masterminding an insider trading scheme that netted him and his associates more than four mln dlrs in illegal profits.     vaskevitch, who headed the mergers and acquisitions department of merrill lynch, pierce, fenner and smith ltd, the london branch of the brokerage giant, leaked inside information about 12 companies to his associates, the sec charged.     also charged were david sofer, an israeli, and two firms he and vaskevitch used. all reside outside u.s. territory.  reuter &#3;</h3>
