	<h3>ford motor co neared general motors corp last year in executive bonuses, while it topped the larger automaker in profit sharing payments to workers.     ford, which outstripped gm in earnings last year, said its 1986 incentive bonuses totaled 167 mln dlrs, slightly behind general motors' 169.1 mln.     general motors, however, did not make any profit-sharing payments to its workers, while ford made a profit-sharing distribution of 372 mln dlrs, or 2,100 dlrs per worker.     general motors, which saw its earnings drop to 2.94 billion dlrs from 1985's 3.99 billion, said the 1986 profit was "not sufficient to generate a payout under the profit-sharing formula."     ford, which earned 3.28 billion dlrs in 1986, up from 2.51 billion in 1985, said it "recognizes employees' efforts and fulfills its commitment to them in many ways, including profit-sharing."  reuter &#3;</h3>
