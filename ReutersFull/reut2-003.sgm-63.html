	<h3>export-import bank of japan president takashi tanaka told brazil the bank will continue to cooperate with it, but he refrained from making any commitment to a new credit, ex-im officials said.     in a 30-minute meeting, tanaka told brazilian finance minister dilson funaro the bank would consider his country's request for a 300 mln dlr credit in the context of international cooperation, the officials said.     they said this meant the ex-im bank would grant the credit as part of a package with money from the international monetary fund and private banks.     brazil has resisted going to the imf for help because it fears that the fund will ask for changes in its economic policies that will throw it into recession.     brazil first requested the 300 mln dlr credit last november, to help it develop the sale and generation of electric power. funaro renewed the request today.  reuter &#3;</h3>
