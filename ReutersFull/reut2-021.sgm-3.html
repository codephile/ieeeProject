	<h3>the canadian auto workers' union said it accepted an economic offer from the canadian division of general motors corp <gm> in contract negotiations.     but union president bob white said many local issues at the 11 plants in ontario and quebec still remained unresolved ahead of thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers.     "it minimizes the possibility of a strike," white told reporters.     however, "if we don't have local agreements settled by thursday, there will be a strike," he said.     the local issues still unresolved involved health care, skilled trades and job classifications, white said.     gm canada negotiator rick curd said he believed a strike would be avoided.     "even though there are some tough issues to be resolved we're on the right schedule to meet the target," curd said.     "i'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations," he said.     union membership meetings have been scheduled for the weekend in case a tentative settlement, said white.     white said the union has also received assurances that a job protection pact negotiated with gm workers in the u.s. does not threaten canadian jobs.     the economic offer for a three-year pact largely matches agreements at ford <f> and chrysler <c> in canada, which include inflation-indexed payments for future retirees and fixed annual payments for current retirees.     it also gives workers wage increases of three pct immediately and 1.5 pct in each of the second and third years.  reuter &#3;</h3>
