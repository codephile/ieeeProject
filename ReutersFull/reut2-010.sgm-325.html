	<h3>the central bank issued 2.47 billion taiwan dlrs worth of certificates of deposit (cds), raising cd issues so far this year to 141.93 billion, a bank spokesman told reuters.     the new cds, repayable from six months to one year, carry interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to five pct, he said.     the issues are intended to help curb the growth of the m-1b money supply, which has expanded as a result of large foreign exchange reserves.     the reserves hit a record 53 billion u.s. dlrs this week.  reuter &#3;</h3>
