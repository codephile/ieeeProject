	<h3>the water supply outlook for most of the western u.s. states this summer looks dim, the u.s. agriculture department said.     snowpack and precipitation were well below normal throughout much of the west as of last week.     eight of the 12 states in which the department collects data reported snowpack and precipitation at three-quarters or less of normal.     it said unless late winter snows or spring rains bring relief, these states can expect possible water shortages this summer.     major water users, including agricultural producers, municipalities and industry, should begin conservation measures now to avoid water rationing later, usda said.     the department said california, one of the country's major agricultural producers, is the driest, with snowpack and precipitation so far this year at less than half of normal.     nevada, idaho, utah, montana, wyoming, oregon and washington also report significant shortages despite pockets of near normal to above noral rainfall in some areas, the department said.     arizona and alaska have higher than normal snowpack and precipitation, while colorado and new mexico are near normal, it said.     the western water supply forecast is based on the latest snow surveys and analyses of precipitation data by the department and the national weather service.  reuter &#3;</h3>
