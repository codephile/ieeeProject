	<h3>primary dealers in u.k. government gilts will not be required to underwrite the government's offering of its securities when the first auctions begin in mid-may, the bank of england said.     in an official notice released today, the bank said "there will be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for the auctions but the bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers, as part of their commitment to the market, to participate actively in the auction process."     the bank was originally believed to have favoured requiring the dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned after those in the u.s. treasury market.     however, the treasury was believed to have baulked at the request by the 27 market makers for an allotment commission which would discourage the largest institutional investors from placing orders for new stock directly through the bank of england, thus denying primary dealers some of their best customers. commission would have been passed along to customers who did place orders via the primary dealers, making it less expensive to buy through them than to go directly to the bank.     market sources said the bank had, in its discussions with the dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that the allotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had a concurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless of market conditions.     indeed, the bank and the gilts dealers are believed to be disappointed that the treasury has not agreed to go along with the plan. however, in its paper, the bank suggested that any conditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandoned or modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficient or unwieldy.     among other items in the document, the bank said its first auction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventional short-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.     subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financial year would first be of up to one billion stg of long-dated stock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up to one billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years in maturity.     the remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would be met by traditional tap offerings of stock via the government broker.     to protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, the bank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a 28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stock of the same type, and it will not necessarily resume selling the stock once the fallow period expires.     in the event that prices offered for the stock to be sold are substantially out of line with market conditions, the bank will agree to take the stock onto its own books.     the bank would then be free to sell the stock during the fallow period but not at a price below the minimum tender price.     the bank also said that at least initially, auctions will be alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which bidders are allotted stock at the price which they bid.     however, the bank said it reserves the right to limit any money market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a single auction. the bank is widely believed to be concerned about preventing a single market maker from cornering a stock to drive the price up.    the bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to prevent dealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuing additional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.     the bank has also agreed to publish information about the auction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete, which is widely expected to be on the same day.     information to be released will include the amount of stock allotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids, and the highest, lowest and average price of the successful bids.  reuter &#3;</h3>
