	<h3>texaco inc said it has filed a motion with the texas court of appeals in houston seeking a rehearing of the court's decision to uphold most of pennzoil co's 11.12 billion dlr judgment against texaco.     the company said its motion cites over 200 errors contained in the february 12 appeals court decision, adding its "brief simply 'rubberstamps' the original trial court judgment which the company has said 'riddled with errors'."     in support of its argument, texaco's motion emphasized a recent case before the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit in chicago in skycom corp v. telstar corp as "unequivocal confirmation that the texas court's opinion is wrong," according to gibson gayle, a texaco attorney with the houston firm of fulbright and jaworski.     "the united states court of appeals in chicago issued the ruling based on facts strikingly similar to the facts in the texaco-pennzoil litigation," he said.     "the question before the (federal appeals) court was whether an "agreement in principle' subject to execution of 'formal documents' is a contract according to new york law.     "the answer by the court was a resounding 'no' -- precisely opposite the answer given by the appellate court in texas," gayle said.     "the united states court of appeals reached this decision for the identical reasons that texas and the attorney general of new york have cited in their briefs before the texas appellate court," he pointed out.     "texaco has consistently maintained that pennzoil did not have a binding contract to buy getty oil shares, since a press release announced only an 'agreement in principle' which was 'subject to the execution of a definitive merger agreement'," according to gayle.  reuter &#3;</h3>
