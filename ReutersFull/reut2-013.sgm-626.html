	<h3>two british opinion polls showed the ruling conservative party would retain power with a clear majority in general elections.     a poll for commercial television, conducted after prime minister thatcher returned from moscow, this morning gave the conservatives their highest rating since they were re-elected in 1983, with 43 pct of the votes, labour 30 and the social democratic-liberal alliance 26 pct.     another poll in the times newspaper taken in 73 key marginal constituencies, predicted a conservative majority of 92 seats.     thatcher does not have to call elections until june 1988.  reuter &#3;</h3>
