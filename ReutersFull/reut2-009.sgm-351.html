	<h3>tricentrol plc <tct.l> said it will concentrate most of its efforts this year on its proven oil and gas reserves in order to maximise benefits to shareholders in the mid to long-term.     it said in a statement "we are confident that substantial development funds will be available to tricentrol and that we will be able to minimise further disposal of our interests."     tricentrol wrote off 57.5 mln stg on the reorganisation of its north american operations last year, when oil prices plunged. the group incurred a 1986 net loss of 3.7 mln stg against a 25.4 mln profit the previous year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
