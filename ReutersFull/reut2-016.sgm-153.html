	<h3>euro-medium term notes, a recent phenomenon in the international capital markets, are hardly attracting a flood of issuers but investment bankers are doing their best to breath life into the market.     medium term notes (mtns) have met with staggering success in the u.s. market where total outstandings have grown to around 50 billion dlrs since 1983, the year they took hold as a new financing vehicle to bridge the gap between commercial paper and longer term bonds. convinced they are here to stay, investment bankers are attempting to adapt mtns for the euromarket.     ralph bunche, a vice president of morgan stanley international, predicted at a recent euromoney conference on mtns here that they will become the predominant instrument for raising funds in the late 1980's and 1990's. "it (the mtn market) will even surpass the bond market," he said.     other bankers took exception with the degree to which mtns will grow. but they generally agreed that these instruments provide the borrower with greater flexibility and lower costs than a traditional bond.     the trick is in convincing european borrowers it is worth arranging a program and, having accomplished that, to persaude european investors -- whose preferences differ from their u.s. counterparts -- to buy the securities.     discussions with bankers proved one thing. no one is exactly sure how to proceed with structuring and marketing these issues.     to date only 13 euro-mtn programs have been announced but only a few have been activated, such as those for a unit of pepsico inc and another for ab electrolux.     several firms have devised different structures for euro-mtns and defend their structures adamantly.     the pepsico notes, for example, are sold on a continuously offered basis. this involves a small amount of new notes with similar maturities constantly on offer at current market rates.     the electrolux program uses multi-tranche tap notes devised by merrill lynch. under this structure, an initial tranche of a minimum 50 mln dlrs has a fixed rate of interest and maturity. the borrower then issues additional notes in this category up to a pre-determined maximum.     those who defend the continuously offered method, such as wendy dietze, a salomon brothers inc vice president, point to the flexibility they offer in interest rate and maturity.     furthermore, she believes this structure offers the european investor greater confidence in market liquidity -- a major concern for these buyers.     merrill lynch europe ltd's kevin regan defends the medium-tranche tap notes concept saying it offers comparable liquidity. but he also said that this structure may not be the right option for all borrowers.     peter mortimer, a partner in the law firm milbank, tweed, hadley and mccloy, noted that legal requirements could well determine which structure is chosen.     he noted that the tap system allows a more clearly defined "lock-up" period as each tranche has a specific maturity. in the case of notes issued by u.s. borrowers, the "lock-up" period is the 90 days after the completion of a series during which time a security cannot be sold back to the u.s. or to u.s. investors.     however, he said that the securities and exchange commission is reviewing its current regulations on the ownership of foreign securities by u.s. citizens and that some softening in the rules could come in the not too distant future.     for their part borrowers say they feel a bit like guinea pigs.     petter skouen, executive vice president of the nordic investment bank (nib), noted that a few weeks ago nib would have said it was disappointed with its euro-mtn program, but that the success of a recent issue changed their minds.     he conceded that in retrospect it would have been wiser to establish separate programs for the euromarket and the u.s. domestic market, rather than try to extend the u.s. issue globally. under nib's 200 mln dlr program, 100 mln has been sold in the u.s. and 25 mln in europe.  reuter &#3;</h3>
