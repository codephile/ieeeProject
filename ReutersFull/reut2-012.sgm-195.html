	<h3>aid donors have promised senegal 1.8 billion dlrs in soft loans over the next three years, to be split between project investment and balance of payment requirements, the world bank said in a statement.     the aid was to support the second phase, running to mid-1990, of senegal's "courageous and far-reaching" medium and long-term adjustment programme.     senegal's plan and cooperation minister cheikh hamidou kane said the country achieved positive growth of 4.2 pct over the last two years, against negative growth of four pct in 1984, liquidated its debt arrears and laid the basis of a sound recovery strategy.     aims over the coming years include giving the private sector a more dynamic role in the economy and rationalising public sector enterprises.     he said senegalese businessmen would make three "regional trips" to saudi arabia, the united states, and paris, to discuss the senegal's "new environment" with western investors.     finance minister mamoudou toure said senegal's global foreign debt excluding short-term commercial debt came to 800 billion francs cfa (2.67 billion dlrs).     citing figures for the budgetary year ending mid-1987 he deplored the fact debt servicing absorbed 50 pct of senegal's budgetary resources, and 27 pct of export revenues.  reuter &#3;</h3>
