	<h3>iowa beef processors inc said "hundreds" of its employees returned to work at its dakota city, nebraska beef processing plant without incident.     last week, iowa beef said it would lift a lockout in effect at the plant since mid-december, which affected 2,800 members of the united food and commercial workers union.     both union and non-union meatpackers who returned to work, agreed to comply with iowa beef's last contract offer.     "start-up went well today and operations will continue to pick up as employees return and others are hired," according to a company statement. picketing ufcwu members at the plant did not disrupt operations, a company spokesman said.     "our employees are asked to continue to return to work at 8am unless otherwise notified," he said.     iowa beef, a subsidiary of occidental petroleum corp, said it is beginning to take applications for permanent positions at the plant.       reuter &#3;</h3>
