	<h3>anchor glass container corp said it expects fourth quarter profits to exceed the 4.7 mln dlrs reported for the third quarter and net income for the full year will be about equal to or slightly exceed 1986's profit before extraordinary items of 20.6 mln dlrs.     for the first nine months, anchor reported operating profits of 16.2 mln dlrs, down from 17.8 mln dlrs in 1986.     it said third quarter profits, which dropped from 8.3 mln dlrs a year earlier, "were on target with management's earlier expectations".     the company had previously said it expected the august 13 purchase of diamond-bathurst inc to reduce third quarter earnings.     it said third quarter earnings were also reduced by about 800,000 dlrs, or six cents a share, by a year-to-date revision in the estimated annual effective tax rate as a result of the acquisition.  reuter &#3;</h3>
