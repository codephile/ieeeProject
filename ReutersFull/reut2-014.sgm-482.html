	<h3>the commodity credit corporation (ccc) has transferred 21.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees previously earmarked for sales of u.s. corn and 5.0 mln dlrs for sales of oilseeds to increase available coverage on sales of u.s. poultry meat to iraq, the u.s. agriculture department said.     the department said the action was taken at the request of iraq's state trade organization for grains and foodstuffs.     the guarantee line for sales of corn has been reduced from 78.0 mln dlrs to 57.0 mln and the line for oilseeds from 5.0 mln dlrs to zero.     the guarantee line for sales of frozen poultry has been increased from 30.0 mln dlrs to 56.0 mln dlrs, usda said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
