	<h3>ncnb corp said the board of governors of the federal reserve system approved its application to merge with (centrabank inc) of baltimore, expected to be completed july 1.     the company said the board's approval included the dismissal of a protest by the baltimore-based maryland alliance for responsible investing against ncnb's performance under the community reinvestment act.         the company said maryland alliance wanted the merger blocked on the grounds that ncnb inadequately served the credit and financial needs of low-income and minority communities in its markets.     the company said it denied the claim.      reuter &#3;</h3>
