	<h3>analyst thomas mccrann of merrill lynch said he reiterated a "buy" recommendation of wang laboratories inc, noting that a successful cost cutting campaign could reduce the earnings loss expected for the third quarter ending in march.     wang was the most actively traded stock on the american stock exchange, rising 3/4 to 16-5/8.     mccrann said that "wang is a little bit ahead of where they were expected to be in their cost reductions, and as a result, the odds have increased that the loss for the quarter will be less than had been expected."     mccrann said he expects wang to report break even earnings per share or only a small loss per share for the third quarter.     he said for the year, however, the company should report a loss of about 50 cts a share compared with earnings of about 35 cts a share a year ago.  reuter &#3;</h3>
