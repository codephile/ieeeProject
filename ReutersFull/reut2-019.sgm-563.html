	<h3>french buying power should remain stable this year despite lower economic growth, while investment will rise sharply, prime minister jacques chirac said.     "i think we will maintain our buying power... i do not think it will fall," chirac told a radio interviewer yesterday. last year french household buying power rose 2.9 pct.     chirac said economic growth would be substantially lower than originally forecast but investment would rise by close to 16 pct in the 1986 to 1988 period, reversing the 3.8 pct decline in the previous four-year period.  reuter &#3;</h3>
