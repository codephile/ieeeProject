	<h3>farmers enrolled over 6.5 mln acres of program crops in the latest conservation reserve program signup and around four mln acres of non-program crops, agriculture department conservation specialists said.     soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of the non-program crop acreage enrolled, a usda analyst said. heavy enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a big percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted for a large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.     wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct of the total 10,572,402 acres accepted into the ten-year program.     usda analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown:     -- wheat  2,615,140 acres     -- corn   1,894,764 acres     -- barley   705,888 acres     -- sorghum  585,552 acres     -- cotton   417,893 acres     -- rice       2,035 acres     -- peanuts      611 acres     -- tobacco      285 acres     -- total program crops  6,512,700 acres     -- total nonprogram     4,059,702 acres     -- total enrollment    10,572,402 acres     usda analysts are currently working on a complete state breakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it ready for publication later this week, they said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
