	<h3>stanley interiors corp said its first quarter shipments and operating income were lower than expected due to snowstorms in january and february that forced the closing of some of its manufacturing facilities for up to six days.     stanley said, however, that any reduction in first quarter operating income will be offset by reduced interest expense and that first quarter net income will be about flat with first quarter 1986 net income of 14 cts a share, or 286,000 dlrs.     stanely also said the first quarter's sales losses would be made up by shipments in the second quarter.  reuter &#3;</h3>
