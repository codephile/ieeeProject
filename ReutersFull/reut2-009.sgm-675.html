	<h3>central bank president jose luis machinea said argentina could adopt the same posture as brazil and suspend payments on its foreign debt if it failed to meet creditor bank demands.     "if argentina had the same difficulties in being unable to refinance (its debt) under the desired (creditor) conditions, that (brasil's) is a path to take," machinea said.     brasil last month suspended payments on a large part of its 109-billion dlr debt, the highest in the developing world.     machinea said brasil did not suspend payments because it wanted to but because it lacked reserves.     argentina has since last month been negotiating a 2.15 billion dlr loan with the steering committee for its international creditor banks to meet 1987 growth targets.     but machinea said the talks were difficult and argentina wanted to conclude them as soon as possible.     "what the (creditor) banks are demanding is not the same as what argentina is prepared to concede," machinea said.     argentina has a global foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs. its debt with private banks is about 30 billion dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
