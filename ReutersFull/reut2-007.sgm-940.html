	<h3>the all-party house of commons finance committee has unanimously called for a "substantial" cut in credit card interest rates charged by banks and other financial institutions.     in a report, the committee recommended that if action is not taken soon, the government should investigate whether there is "anti-competitive behaviour" among the banks.     minister of state for finance tom hockin told the commons prior to the release of the report he favored a cut in the rates and promised to act quickly on its recommendations.     the committee said interest rates should be lowered to no more than the 15.9 pct per annum level announced recently by the toronto dominion bank.     rates on other bank cards range from 18 to 21 pct and to 24 to 28 pct on gasoline and department store cards.     at a news conference, committee members said they would call for a legislated rate ceiling if the banks do not take action quickly.     "i would be unhappy if they didn't make an announcement next week," said committee chairman don blenkarn, also a member of the ruling progressive conservative party.     new democratic party member michael cassidy said, "i hope the banks see the writing on the wall and take appropriate action."     the group did recommend legislation be enacted to ensure a uniform method of calculating interest on unpaid balances and that a grace period be allowed for new purchases.  reuter &#3;</h3>
