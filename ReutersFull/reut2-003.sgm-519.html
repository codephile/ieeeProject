	<h3>the yen's rise against the dollar is expected to boost japan's unemployment rate to an average 3.3 pct in the 1987/88 fiscal year beginning april 1 from january's record three pct, the private nomura research institute said.     the official 1987/88 estimate is 2.9 pct.     the research arm of nomura securities co forecast unemployment would exceed two mln by mid-fiscal 1987, against an estimated 1.75 mln for the current year.     nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment.     employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical machinery sectors, nomura said.     employment in the non-manufacturing sector will continue to increase, the institute said, without giving figures.  reuter &#3;</h3>
