	<h3>deutsche babcock ag <dbcg.f> will increase its dividend on results in the year ending september 30, 1987, chief executive helmut wiehn said.     wiehn told a news conference deutsche babcock would double the absolute amount it distributes to shareholders. this overall increase would also be due partly to an increase of nominal share capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.     a higher dividend had been anticipated because deutsche babcock has said in the past that it will only raise capital when it can make a lasting improvement in the dividend.  reuter &#3;</h3>
