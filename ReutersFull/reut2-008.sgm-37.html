	<h3>world bank president barber conable said he believed brazil's decision to suspend foreign debt interest payments is temporary.     conable in a wide-ranging television interview to be shown on public broadcasting tomorrow said brazil now has the attention of its creditors and must come up with a plan designed to reform its economy.     "i think the brazilians have the attention of many of their creditors, but they must come up with a plan that will persuade people that the brazilian economy is going to be put on a course that will result in some growth."     turning to japan, conable said the role of that country has been increasing in the world bank and is expected to continue to do so.     he said that japan had made an additional 450 mln dlr pledge to the international development association, an indication that it agrees that it must provide more help in line with its economic position.     conable said there was no indication that the soviet union was serious about joining the international monetary fund and world bank. he said they would have to get convertible currency and open their books and the soviets "don't usually do that."  reuter &#3;</h3>
