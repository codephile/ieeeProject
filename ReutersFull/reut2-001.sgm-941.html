	<h3>a limited belgian issue of silver ecu coins with a face value of five ecus will go on sale from march 23 at a price of 500 belgian francs each, a finance ministry spokesman said.     gold ecu coins with a face value of 50 ecus will be sold from the same day. the spokesman told reuters the price for these would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely to be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs.     at least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of thousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said. they will be sold both in belgium and abroad.     the coins will be the first ever denominated in the ecu, the "basket" comprised of the 12-nation european community's currencies except the spanish peseta and the portuguese escudo.     the issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of the ec's founding treaty of rome this month. finance minister mark eyskens, who currently presides over the ec's council of economic and finance ministers, has called the issue a political act of symbolic value which aimed to make the community's goal of monetary integration more concrete.     the coins will be legal tender in belgium but most demand is expected to come from coin collectors.  reuter &#3;</h3>
