	<h3>a unanimous supreme court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies.     the ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.     the administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of alaska since december 1980.     a federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the bering sea off alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native eskimos.     but the supreme court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration.     "here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable," justice byron white wrote for the court. "and on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined," he said.     the oil companies, amoco corp <an>, arco, exxon corp <xon>, mobil corp <mob>, sohio, shell, texaco inc <tx> and union oil, had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses.     the first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.     administration officials, saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.     the alaskan villages of gambell and stebbins, along with an organization of eskimo natives on the yukon delta, argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.  reuter &#3;</h3>
