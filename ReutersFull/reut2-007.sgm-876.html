	<h3>a strike by 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation comibol has paralysed tin production in the major centers of huanuni, corocoro, siglo, catavi and colquiri, the conflicts secretary of the bolivian miners federation, cristobal aranibar, told reuters.      the strike began at midnight to press demands for higher wages and more funds for the nationalised mining industry.      the miners federation left the door open to negotiations with the government but "only if the authorities show their intention to find solution to our demands", aranibar said.     the government of president victor paz estenssoro, faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies, has said the miners strike was part of a campaign to discredit it during the visit of west german president, richard von weizsaecker, who arrives today for a four-day official visit.     the government froze salaries as part of its efforts to pull bolivia out of a deep economic crisis. according to central bank forecasts inflation will reach an annual 10 pct rate versus up to 20,000 pct in 1985.      in addition to the miners' strike, about 1,000 railway factory workers of the bolivian labour organization (cob) began a second day of a hunger strike in the country's main cities to press for substantial wage increases, a union leader said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
