	<h3>south korea's gross national product (gnp) is forecast to grow by nine pct in 1987, surpassing the government's original forecast of eight pct and against a 12.5 pct rise in 1986, an economic planning board report said.     the report reviewing the country's economy in the first three months of this year said year-on-year gnp was provisionally estimated to have grown by about 12 pct in the period, against a 10.5 pct growth in the same 1986 period.     board officials said the gnp rise in the january-march period is due largely to increased exports, which totalled 9.34 billion dlrs against 6.9 billion a year earlier.  reuter &#3;</h3>
