	<h3>british petroleum co plc does not intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of standard oil co, bp managing director david simon said.     "we don't seen this as any progressive bidding game," he told reporters at a news conference. bp now owns 55 pct of standard's stock.     simon said bp had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not identify, as saying bp's careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer.     "i think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. i think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation," he said. "let's wait and see how the offer runs."     another official declined to speculate under what circumstances bp might raise its bid.     the bp official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company's assets, including the value of its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves.     he said the price royal dutch/shell group <rd> <sc> paid for publicly held shell oil co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times cash flow.     the bp official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over standard's stock price over the past year.     bp group treasurer rodney chase said more than half to as much as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs bp needs for its offer will come from existing sources. the rest will be financed by new debt.     bp will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit, he explained.     the company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed, chase said. but the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months, he added.     chase also said 50 to 60 pct of standard oil's publicly held shares are held by financial institutions.     simon said standard's board was informed of the offer on march nine and has been considering it since that time.     he said bp does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition. "we have informed washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral part of ownership of u.s. oil reserves," he pointed out.     simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in saudi arabia and other opec members to control oil production.     "we think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime," simon said.     "we have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see prices going much higher," he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
