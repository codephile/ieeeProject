	<h3>navistar international corp said it is recalling 33,000 medium tucks and 19,000 school buses equipped with power assisted hydraulic brakes to modify the electrical power supply to the backup breaking system.     the company said an electrical failure in the main engine wiring harness could stall the engine, knocking out the primary power assist to the brakes while simultaneously shutting off electrical power to the backup pump. this would render the vehicle's service brakes inoperative.     it said it is aware of only one accident arising from the problem.  reuter &#3;</h3>
