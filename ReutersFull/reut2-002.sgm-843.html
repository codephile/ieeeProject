	<h3>finance minister dilson funaro, currently on an international tour to seek governmental support for his efforts to solve brazil's 108-billion-dlr foreign debt crisis, said creditors have expressed willingness to help.     in an interview with the globo television network, transmitted from rome, funaro said the reception by representatives of creditor countries with whom he met along the week was always to seek new ways.     "brazil made several adjustments in its economy in the past which affected the goodwill of its people. we now wish to keep the country's growth in order to be able to face the problems of the future," funaro said.     the minister said that he had proposed a "four-year plan" to the creditors, which would include a rescaling of the commitments derived from its debt.     "we cannot continue negotiating every year with our creditors, having to face difficulties in the meantime, not knowing whether a new package will or will not be approved, as it is happening to other debtor countries," the minister said.      reuter &#3;</h3>
