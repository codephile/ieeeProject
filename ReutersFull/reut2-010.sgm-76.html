	<h3>brazilian president jose sarney will reshuffle part of his cabinet next month but will preserve his finance minister, a presidential source said.     the cabinet reshuffle, expected since the resignation of minister of planning joao sayad eight days ago, is due to take place within two to three weeks, the source said.     the source, who asked not to be identified, said that "in principle, the reshuffle would not affect finance minister dilson funaro."     rumours circulating here yesterday said funaro was on his way out of the cabinet, but both he and sarney denied this.  reuter &#3;</h3>
