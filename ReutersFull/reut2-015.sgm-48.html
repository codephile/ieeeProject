	<h3>the federal reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to supply temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.     economists expect the fed to execute 2.0-2.5 billion dlrs of customer repos to offset pressures from the end of the two-week bank reserve maintenance period today. some also look for a permanent reserve injection to offset seasonal pressures via an outright purchase of bills or coupons this afternoon.      the federal funds rate opened at 6-3/8 pct and remained at that level, up from yesterday's 6.17 pct average.  reuter &#3;</h3>
