	<h3>british airways said it suspended sale in the u.s. of its "europe on us" for travel from the u.s. due to disapproval by the u.s. department of transporation on grounds of reciprocity.     under the promotional program, customers would buy a round trip from the u.s. to london and would receive a free round trip ticket from london to one of 45 cities in 16 countries.     a company spokesman said the transportation department's contention was that american carriers could not compete in this program. british airways said it is seeking a review of the decision.  reuter &#3;</h3>
