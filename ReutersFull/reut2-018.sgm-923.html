	<h3>the international tin council, itc, intervened in a high court hearing in an attempt to prevent the presentation of internal council documents as evidence.     the intervention in shearson lehman's action against the london metal exchange over its "ring out" of tin contracts in 1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which the council is involved following the collapse of its buffer stock operations in october 1985, itc delegates said.     the itc's case is being presented by professor rosalyn higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next week. court does not sit tomorrow.     in essence the council is claiming that its status is similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can therefore not be used in an english court of law.     the council ended its quarterly session today ahead of schedule. the meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow when the european community's legal advisers were due to attend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various legal actions today.     otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal administrative matters, delegates said.     the itc will continue to operate with a reduced staff after june 30 following the two year extension of the sixth international tin agreement.     as well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the council will continue with its statistical work and carry out some research studies, although staffing in the research department is being cut to one from two previously.     at this week's session the council elected philip sparkes of australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members and heinz hofer of switzerland as second vice-chairman for the consumers for the year from july 1. future quarterly sessions are scheduled for october 5/7 and december 14/16.  reuter &#3;</h3>
