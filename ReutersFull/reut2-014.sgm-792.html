	<h3>gold opened firmer in fairly active trading on continued buying interest and light short covering following the sharp rise in new york, dealers said.     they said gold drew its strength from the buoyant silver market which has been underpinned by speculative purchases.     the metal opened at 422.80/423.20 u.s. dlrs an ounce against new york's 422.25/423.25 close and the 420.00/50 finish here yesterday.     on the local market gold opened 26 h.k. dlrs higher at 3,930 h.k. dlrs a tael.  reuter &#3;</h3>
