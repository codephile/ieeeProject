	<h3>an error interrupted testing of an ariane rocket third stage starter motor on monday but there should be little or no delay in the launch program, arianespace said.     a joint statement from the european arianespace consortium and the motor manufacturer societe europeenne de propulsion (sep) said that to avoid any risk, the motor had been dismantled and could not be used in the next launch.     it had immediately been replaced by another motor and new tests had begun today.     "in these conditions, the flight v19 remains scheduled before the end of june," the statement said.     ariane launches have been suspended since an ignition failure in the third stage motor last may forced controllers to blow up a rocket in flight.     sep has been carrying out a series of nearly 50 simulated-altitude tests on the redesigned starter at its tightly guarded plant in the town of vernon, 80 km northwest of paris.     the arianespace-sep statement said that during a test on march 23, a fault in the preparation of the altitude simulation chamber meant a component of the motor came under abnormal pressure.     arianespace originally hoped to resume launches by february this year, but a longer-than-expected test program on the new starter motor forced postponement of the next launch.     the total orderbook of outstanding launches for the 13-member european space agency's ariane rockets runs to more than 40 satellites and is worth more than two billion dlrs.     the ariane program is the main rival to the united states' nasa agency in the lucrative satellite launch market. its orders have sharply increased largely as a result of the u.s. space shuttle disaster in january 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
