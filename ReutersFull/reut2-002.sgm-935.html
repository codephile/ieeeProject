	<h3>the treasury proposed allowing  temporary imports of south african uranium ore and uranium oxide until july 1 under certain conditions pending clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by congress last fall.     the proposal to be published in the federal register next week requests written congressional and public comment within 60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported for u.s. processing and exporting to third countries.     the treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary imports because it felt congress had not intended when it passed the comprehensive south african sanctions bill last fall -- overriding president reagan's veto -- to hurt u.s. industry.     "the domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal government's enrichment industry could be seriously injured in a manner not intended by congress if the . . . import ban on uranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for processing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the act," the treasury brief said.     the treasury said an outright u.s. ban of uranium ore and oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their south african origin ore and oxide to other countries including the soviet union for processing.     treasury said it would allow imports of the south african ore and oxide until july 1 for processing and re-export "provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a license for importation issued by the nuclear regulatory commission."     the treasury brief also proposed allowing u.s.-origin goods to be imported temporarily from south african state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing in the united states.     "the u.s. customs will allow such importation to be made under bond," the brief said.     the south african sanctions law, enacted by the united states to protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced by south africa's white minority government, prohibited imports of uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel, coal and textiles at the end of 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
