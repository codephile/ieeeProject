	<h3>lme aluminium prices eased this morning under light dollar based selling of three months delivery but persistent covering of nearby short positions widened the backwardation to around 69 stg from 66 yesterday, dealers said.     three months ended official ring dealings at 805.50 stg, down 2.50 stg a tonne from yesterday afternoon's kerb close, and the dollar equivalent traded from 1,299 on the pre-market down to 1,293 dlrs at the end of the rings and compared with 1,298 yesterday.     the nearby covering was prompted by supply tightness created by likely large april option declarations but no reports circulated this morning of any further enquiry for short term april options. this was evident friday and yesterday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
