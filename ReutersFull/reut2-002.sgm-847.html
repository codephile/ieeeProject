"at a time when the world is attempting to liberalize trade in the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations, it is incomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so much from the reduction in agricultural trade barriers would threaten that process by caving in to pressures for protectionism," council president darwin e. stolte said.     canada's finding will strain the u.s./canadian trading relationship, could damage the future of u.s. feedgrains  support for the free trade negotiations, and also negatively impact farm trade reform with other nations, the council said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
