	<h3>the norwegian company <konsgberg vaapenfabrikk> (kv) may have sold more high technology defence equipment since an original deal in 1982, senior justice officials said.     state prosecutor tor-aksel busch told reuters he had started fresh investigations into the state-owned arms firm which delivered computers to the soviet union in 1982 and 1983, used to make near-silent submarine propellers.     "there may have been other deliveries of the same equipment since then," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
