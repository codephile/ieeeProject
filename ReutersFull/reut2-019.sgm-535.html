	<h3>bahrain's 19 commercial banks have been instructed by the bahrain monetary agency (bma) to return to a six day working week with effect from july 4.     a circular sent to the banks today reverses a shift in early april to a five day week and follows three months of controversy within the domestic banking sector over hours.     a bma spokesman said the circular, which does not affect offshore banks, represented a "compromise solution" between differing views within the industry and was drawn up following the agency's own survey of banks, staff and customers.     in april the bma allowed commercial banks to operate a five day week from sunday to thursday. banks have since been closed on fridays, the islamic weekend, and saturdays.     the new regulation will require banks to work from 7.30 a.m. to 12 noon from saturday to thursday inclusive. banks may open on these days during the afternoon between 3.30 and 5.30.     the regulations apply to bank opening hours, not to staff working hours, which continue to be decided by banks.     under the five day week introduced in early april, banks have been obliged to open from 8 a.m. until noon and from 3.30 to 5.30 p.m.  reuter &#3;</h3>
