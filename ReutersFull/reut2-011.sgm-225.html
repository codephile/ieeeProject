	<h3>the proceeds from yesterday's 100 mln dlr equity warrant for kansallis-osake-pankki (k-o-p) will probably be swapped into floating rate dollars once the final terms have been set for the deal, executive vice-president erkki karmila told a press conference.     the seven-year issue has an indicated coupon of 4-1/8 to 4-5/8 pct and is priced at par. final terms will be set on april 7.     karmila said that in the short term k-o-p did not need additional capital funds but the issue "gives us access to attractive funds."  reuter &#3;</h3>
