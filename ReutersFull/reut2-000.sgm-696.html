	<h3>currency fluctuations may reassert their influence on the bullion market in the near future, bullion bankers samuel montagu and co ltd said in a market report.     but the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.     "opec's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices remains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears that the market should be approached cautiously," montagu said.     the bank said the us economy has shown no noticeable long-term improvement and that both latin american debt and the iranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar.  reuter &#3;</h3>
