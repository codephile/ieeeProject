	<h3>contel corp said its expects to report second quarter earnings that are lower than last year's 74 cts a share and 1987 earnings from continuing operations that are about 15 pct lower than last year's 3.04 dlrs per share.     donald weber, president and chief executive officer of contel, said that lower than expected revenues, higher than anticipated costs to complete certain contracts and one-time expenses are behind the lower earnings projections.     as such, weber said contel has begun to evaluate strategies, budgets and operating direction in each of the company's divisions "with renewed emphasis on maximizing shareholder value."     weber added that contel is holding discussions with <comsat> on an agreement to terminate the previosuly proposed merger between the two companies.     weber added that the results of the evaluations of certain parts of the company may be reflected later this year in a combination of one-time gains or losses not in the anticipated lower earnings.     webber said, however, that he was encouraged by the continued strength of contel's telephone businesses and the strong showing from certain of the company's non-regulated sectors.     but, he added, that results for other parts of the company will still be unsatisfactory.  reuter &#3;</h3>
