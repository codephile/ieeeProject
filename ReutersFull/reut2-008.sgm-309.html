	<h3>u.s. treasury secretary james baker said he was making progress negotiating reform of the inter-american development bank with other member nations.     in a speech prepared for delivery to the annual meeting of the iadb, baker said, "we are making progress in negotiating reforms."     and he added that if succesful, washington would be ready to put up an additional nine billion dlrs to the seventh iadb four-year capital replenishment, an increase of 75 pct.     it was not immediately clear what the overall size of the capital replenishment would be if the u.s. went ahead with such a capital increase.     but baker's statement that he had made progress in negotiating reforms came after a weekend meeting of the bank's policy making board of governors at which the reform issue was put off until next june because of deep differences between washington and latin borrowing countries.     baker said the u.s. increase would account for 70 pct of the bank's useable financial resources.     currently washington is only allowed to vote 34.5 pct in iadb board meetings considering loans to latin american countries.     but the latin borrowing nations control 54 pct of the vote and frequently approve loans to which economic reform conditions are not tied.     baker pointed out that western nations which provide 95 pct of the bank's financial resources represent just 46 pct of the vote.     baker said the u.s seeks a greater say in bank decisions for itself and other creditor countries.     "in view of this imbalance we don't believe it is unreasonable to ask for a change," baker said. he said the changes sought by the u.s. would require loan approval by a greater majority of shares than a simple majority.     but he stopped short of reaffirming the original u.s. position that veto power should exist with a 35 pct vote.     enlarging on reforms washington would like to see, baker said he wanted the iadb to play a much greater role in the u.s. debt strategy for promoting inflation free economic growth, open markets and a reduced government role in the economies of debtor nations.     under reforms he said the u.s. wants the iadb to adopt a major program of lending to specific economic sectors in debtor countries on condition the countries carried out policy reforms in those areas of their economies.     such reforms would include, among other things, more concern for natural resource management.     baker said this lending should help debtors make a transition to more open economies and freer markets.     he also said the bank could double its current lending volume from capital and triple its concessional loans to the poorest nations.     the treasury secretary also called for the iadb to improve its analysis of the policies of debtor countries, strengthening its process for assessing the specific needs of debtor nations. he urged a wholesale reorganization of bank personnel. baker said, "we simply believe that more discretion and policy influence should lie with the parties which contribute the lion's share of resources."     he pointed out that despite tight budget problems the reagan administration has asked congress to finance the iadb and other multilateral development banks.     pointing out that such funding was difficult today in the best of circumstances, he said it would be impossible if congress did not have confidence in bank lending policies.  reuter &#3;</h3>
