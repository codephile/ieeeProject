	<h3>u.k. helicopter maker <westland plc> will reduce the 6,000 workforce of its helicopter division by around a third over the next few weeks, a company spokesman said.     he said the decision was in part the result of a 400 mln stg government order for military helicopters announced earlier.     the spokesman said the order had reduced the number of redundancies necessary but was not large enough to avoid job losses. the total group workforce is 11,000. the company was rescued last year by a consortium of united technologies corp's <utx.n> sikorsky unit and fiat spa <fiat.mi>.  reuter &#3;</h3>
