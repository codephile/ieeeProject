	<h3>tanzania will need about 1.2 billion dlrs of hard currency investment to support its 1987-1992 five-year plan which begins in july, minister of state for finance damas mbogoro said.     he told an economic planning seminar in the northern town of arusha yesterday that the new plan would concentrate on rehabilitating tanzania's existing infrastructure, with a minimum of investment in new development projects.     the aim is to boost agricultural production by five pct a year and industrial output by 6.4 pct, he said.     in 1985, before president ali hassan mwinyi began dismantling tanzania's doctrinaire socialist policies to implement his current economic recovery program, agricultural production grew by only 0.6 pct, while industrial output declined by 5.2 pct.     mbogoro said the success of the new five-year plan would depend greatly on the ability to exercise self-discipline and make best use of limited resources. prime minister joseph warioba and finance minister cleopa msuya have both stressed that government departments must exercise financial discipline and live within their budgets.  reuter &#3;</h3>
