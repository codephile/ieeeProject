	<h3>winter kill has probably affected west german winter barley and rapeseed to an above average degree this season, west german grain trader alfred c. toepfer said in its latest report.     it is too soon to assess the extent of the damage, but it is likely that northern west german crops are particularly at risk because of insufficient snow cover, it said.     the soil needs to warm up rapidly and moisture content must improve to avoid further delays to spring field work, it added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
