"he intends to dedicate himself to teaching at the university of costa rica," he said.     lizano could not be reached immediately for comment on his decision to leave the central bank.     well-placed sources said his departure follows months of bitter infighting over government economic policy and the handling of this nation's foreign debt, which is among the highest per capita in the world.  reuter &#3;</h3>
