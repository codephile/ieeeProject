	<h3>yugoslavia, whose economic crisis is under close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not follow brazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt, prime minister branko mikulic was quoted as saying.     mikulic was speaking to west german journalists in an interview published yesterday by the tanjug news agency.     he said yugoslavia had always paid its debts and would continue to do so, but he said creditors and international institutions should show more "understanding" for yugoslavia's situation.     mikulic said yugoslavia had "understanding" for what brazil had done.     yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, lagging exports and low productivity. this month makulic imposed partial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread strikes. tanjug said in the interview mikulic warned the army could be called in if yugoslavia's political system was threatened. official reports show yugoslavia ended 1986 with hard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. in 1986 it repaid a record 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing its overall debt by 996 mln dlrs.     government ministers told reporters last week they regretted yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. they said the cost to the economy had been too great.     earlier this month deputy prime minister janos milosavljevic said yugoslavia needed new credits. foreign minister raif dizdarevic said in caracas, "radical changes" in interest rates and repayment times were needed.     western economists said mikulic's remarks, taken with those of his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seen ahead in financing the debt repayments.     yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be considered by the paris club at the end of this month.     the international monetary fund, which recently reviewed the yugoslav economy, is said by western diplomats to be alarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here and the possibility of balance of payments problems later this year.     mikulic visits west germany next week, and debt is expected to figure high on the agenda of his talks with chancellor helmut kohl.  reuter &#3;</h3>
