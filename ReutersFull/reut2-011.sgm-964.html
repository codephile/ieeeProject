	<h3>the u.k. export credit guarantee department (ecgd) said it would change the system of premiums it levies from british exporters, reducing their costs when they tender for a contract abroad.     it said in a statement that the changes involved halving the rate of non-refundable premiums levied by the ecgd from exporters before the contract they tender for is allocated. the rates of additional premium paid by successful tenderers will rise.  the last overhaul in premiums was in 1984 when charges for cover rose sharply after several years of heavy losses.  reuter &#3;</h3>
