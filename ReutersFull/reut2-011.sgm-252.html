	<h3>general acquisition co said it was disappointed by gencorp's response to its tender offer and asked how the company might give better value to shareholders.     gencorp had earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per share tender offer from general acquisition, an affiliate of wagner and brown and afg industries inc, and said it was studying financially superior alternatives.     the general acquisition partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive, particularly since it had tried to discuss the offer with gencorp.     the partnership said gencorp failed to say how it would provide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill." poison pills are shareholder rights plans that make takeovers more expensive.     gencorp said in its statement earlier that it planned to put off the date its rights will trade separately from the common stock to april 6 from april 3. it said the extension was subject to further extensions by the board and is conditional on no person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of gencorp before april 6.     general acquisition said it is confident its offer can be completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.     the partnership in its statement again urged gencorp management to work with it to facilitate a transaction.  reuter &#3;</h3>
