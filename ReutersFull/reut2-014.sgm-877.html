	<h3>the five-nation <international aero engine> (iae) consortium has decided not to go ahead with the proposed launch of its superfan engine, a spokesman for consortium member <rolls-royce plc> said.     he said a group board meeting had concluded that a launch would have been premature given the risks involved in trying to meet an availability date of spring, 1992 required by airlines.     however, he added that the project had not been cancelled and could be offered later on.     the engine was originally proposed for fitting on the <airbus industrie> a340.     iae's members are rolls, united technologies corp's <utx.n> pratt and whitney, fiat spa <fiat.mi> <japanese aero engines corp> and <mtu> of west germany.     airbus said this week it would switch to the franco-u.s. cfm-56-s3 alternative because of doubts whether the superfan would be ready on time.     rolls, which has been state-owned since 1971, launches its "pathfinder" prospectus giving preliminary details of its public flotation later today.     analysts said that the timing of the postponement of superfan -- an 30,000 pound thrust upgrade of the consortium's v2500 engine fitted to the a320 -- was embarrassing but should not be considered a serious blow. if anything, it indicated the financial prudence of the group, one added.     the rolls spokesman added that the decision did not affect the v2500 programme itself. equally, there was the possibility that the consortium would go ahead with the superfan later on.     rolls rb211 engine was not available for fitting to early versions of the boeing co <ba.n> 747 but had since captured about 25 pct of the market, he noted.  reuter &#3;</h3>
