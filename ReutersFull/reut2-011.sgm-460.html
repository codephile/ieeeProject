	<h3>the united states and japan are not involved in a trade war, despite u.s. sanctions announced last week against japanese semiconductors, u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter said.     "in my judgement, we're not even close to a trade war," yeutter told a house agriculture committee hearing.     yeutter said if japan takes action to honor its agreement with the u.s. on semiconductor trade, "then the retaliatory response will last a relatively short period."     yeutter said japan must stop dumping chips in third countries and buy more american computer chips.  reuter &#3;</h3>
