	<h3>the 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling accord venezuela signed a week ago will reduce its payments over the next three years by 64 pct, according to finance ministry figures released this weekend.     a ministry statistical analysis said while the original accord called for payments of 3.82 billion dlrs between 1987 and 1989, the new agreement requires debt servicing of 1.35 billion over the same period. in 1987, venezuela will be required to pay 250 mln dlrs instead of the 1.55 billion originally agreed. payments in 1988 were cut to 400 mln from 1.20 billion, and in 1989 to 700 mln from 1.11 billion.     the ministry's analysis said the reduction in debt servicing during 1987-1989 amounts to an effective grace period, something the venezuelan negotiators sought from creditor banks but were not granted.     most of the rescheduling falls during 1994-1998, when 53.3 pct, or some 11.25 billion dlrs, must be paid. under the february 27 accord, venezuela will repay 20.3 billion dlrs of public sector debt over 14 years at 7/8 of a percentage point over london interbank offered rates (libor).     this compares with the february 1986 accord which called for a 12-year term and interest of 1-1/8 point over libor.  reuter &#3;</h3>
