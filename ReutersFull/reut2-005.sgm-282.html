	<h3>banca della svizzera italiana <bisz.z> said it planned a one-for-12 rights issue at 300 pct of nominal value to raise about 50 mln francs new capital.     the rights issue would have a theoretical value to shareholders of 140 swiss francs per bearer share and 45 per registered share.     bsi was also seeking shareholder authorization for 200,000 new participation certificates of a nominal value of 100 francs without rights for shareholders, to back future convertible or warrant bonds or for other purposes. existing 500-franc "b" tranche certificates would be split five-for-one.     the split would improve the marketability of the existing certificates, chief executive giorgio ghiringhelli told a news conference.     the new bearer shares would be priced at 1,500 francs, compared with a closing price last friday of 3,325 on the zurich stock exchange, while the registered shares would be issued at 300 francs against a market price of 900.  reuter &#3;</h3>
