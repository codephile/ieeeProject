	<h3>exxon corp said that 1986's 15 pct increase in earnings per share to 7.42 dlrs a share were partially based on its streamlined operations which compensated for the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest crude oil prices in a decade.     exxon said economies introduced in its operations from reductions in personnel and other savings, such as reductions in exploration expenses, were reflected in an 880 mln dlr reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985.     the company said its more efficient operations would be necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead.     the company also said that its share repurchase plan contributed to the per share gains over 1985.     in a breakdown of costs, exxon said that operating expenses slipped to 9.2 billion dlrs in 1986 from 9.7 billion dlrs the previous year and exploration expenses, including dry holes, slipped back to 1.2 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion dlrs over the same period as the number of wells drilled was lower.     the company was also able to use lower interest rates to reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627 mln dlrs the previous year.     exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6 pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct.     on december 31, 1986 exxon's total debt of 7.87 billion dlrs was down slightly from the previous year's 7.9 billion dlrs and long term debt stood at 4.3 billion dlrs, down from 4.8 billion dlrs in 1985.     exxon's policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its treasury also contributed to earnings results by a reduction of shares to 722.6 mln shares from 754.1 mln shares the previous year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
