	<h3>world bank president barber conable said he was confident brazil would come up with a debt plan and that the current suspension on commercial bank debt payments would be temporary.     he said brazil's decision to stop payments on its debt had captured the attention of the international community but the country should now produce a plan to reform its overheated economy.     "they have everyone's attention but it must be followed by a constructive plan," he said.     conable made his remarks before a group of commercial bankers at a meeting sponsored by the export-import bank and later informally to reporters.  reuter &#3;</h3>
