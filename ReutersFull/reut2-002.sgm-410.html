	<h3>giant bay resources ltd said a metallurgical study of its gordon lake gold deposit indicated an overall recovery of 95 pct to 96 pct of the gold can be achieved by either direct cyanidation of ore or flotation followed by cyanidation of concentrate.     continuation of an underground program on the property will begin in june, extending an existing drift along the 200-foot-level where the main ore zone was encountered, giant bay said.     the company did not elaborate on production figures for the property.  reuter &#3;</h3>
