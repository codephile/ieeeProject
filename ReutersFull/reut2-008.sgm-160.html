"we should in our overall economic planning put agriculture in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by the year 2000," he said. "we must avoid the situation in recent years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain."     the paper quoted deng as saying that the state council has decided to raise the price of five grains, including corn and rice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details.  reuter &#3;</h3>
