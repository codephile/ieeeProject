	<h3>moody's investors service said it has confirmed its ratings on about 4.4 billion dlrs of outstanding securities of public service electric and gas co, a unit of public service enterprise group inc.     the ratings include aa3-rated first and refunding mortgage bonds, secured pollution control revenue bonds and eurobonds.     although public service recently received a disappointing rate order from the new jersey board of public utilities, the agency believes the company's strong financial management should help maintain debt-protection measurements within current levels over the next few years.  reuter &#3;</h3>
