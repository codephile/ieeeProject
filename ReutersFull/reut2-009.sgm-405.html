	<h3>the u.s. senate agriculture committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and aid missions to promote the use of u.s. food aid, donation, credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.     the bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade missions made up of representatives of the departments of agriculture and state, the agency for international development, the overseas private investment corp, market development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.     at least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year after enactment of the bill. the missions would promote u.s. programs, including pl480, section 416 donations, export enhancement program, the dairy export incentive program, and export credit guarantee programs (gsm-102, gsm-103).     the panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill, offered by sen. john melcher (d-mont.), that would have required the u.s. agriculture department to donate at least one mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.     current law requires usda to donate at least 750,000 tonnes of surplus grains and dairy products under the section 416 food donation program.     the congressional budget office estimated that the proposed increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up to 50 mln dlrs per year, senate staff said.     the committee also dropped a provision identifying which countries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities.     under the bill adopted by the committee, countries "friendly to the united states" would be eligible to host the trade missions.     melcher originally had proposed sending missions to mexico, the philippines, indonesia, bangladesh, senegal, nigeria, peru, kenya, the dominican republic, costa rica, malaysia, venezuela, tunisia and morocco.     the bill also would require the foreign agricultural service, fas, to have at least 850 full-time employees during fiscal years 1987-89. as of february 28, fas had 790 full-time employees, a fas spokesman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
