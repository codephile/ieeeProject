	<h3>president reagan said he will veto an 87.5 billion dlr highway and transit bill, citing his commitment to hold to spending cuts to meet budget deficit reduction goals.     "i am adamantly opposed to the excessive spending that is in the bill as it emerged from a (house-senate) conference committee," he said in a statement.     white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan had reservations on 152 so-called demonstration highway projects and on the amount for transit projects.     the bill called for transit projects totalling 17.8 billion dlrs, compared to 8.7 billion proposed by the administration.     fitzwater said, however, that reagan supported the right of states to raise the highway speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph, a provision that is also in the legislation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
