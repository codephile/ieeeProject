	<h3>u.s. senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy (d-vt.) said it would be impossible to cut two billion dlrs from the fiscal 1988 agriculture budget as proposed by senate budget committee chairman lawton chiles (d-fla.)     "i don't know how we could possibly absorb two billion dlrs of cuts without enormous disruptions," leahy told the national cattlemen's association.     chiles has proposed making unspecified policy changes that would trim two billion dlrs from farm income and price support programs in the fiscal year beginning next october.     leahy said such cuts would be impossible, that one billion dlrs in cuts would be "darn near impossible" and that a spending freeze would be difficult.     leahy said congress would have to provide "some money" for the farm credit system, but that a "wholesale bailout" would not be forthcoming.     "we may need changes in (the system's) procedures but we will not let the system go belly up or simply become another bank," he said.     a task force composed of leahy and sens. david boren (d-okla.), rudy boschwitz (r-minn.) and richard lugar (r-ind.) is working on a proposal for assisting the farm credit system that leahy said should be ready shortly after congress's easter recess, set for april 13 through 20.     leahy said his panel would consider changes in the wheat and feedgrains programs this year, including a proposal to establish mandatory production controls.     however, he said a bill offered by sen. tom harkin (d-iowa) and rep. richard gephardt (d-mo.) would probably not pass congress as presently written.     a bill to provide emergency disaster assistance to midwestern grain producers, already passed by the house, may not be considered by the senate for another 10 days because members have lined up as many as two dozen amendments costing billions of dollars, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
