	<h3>india's private businessmen say they have been placed on an unequal footing in raising money from the capital market because government companies are wooing investors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds.     stock brokers and bankers polled by reuters said although equity shares or debenture issues floated by private firms provide a higher return and shorter maturity, they are fast losing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealth and income taxes.     brokers said many investors are transferring funds into government company bonds because of their tax-free status and easy transferability.     about 100 private companies have postponed plans to issue equity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 1987/88 partly on account of fierce competition from public sector bonds, a merchant banker said.     they included equity shares and rights issue worth one billion rupees planned to be issued this month by tata fertilisers ltd, he said, adding the issue has been postponed indefinitely.     "the government bonds are making serious inroads on the private sector companies' resources," said r. p. goenka, president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry.     "the discriminatory tax treatment should be done away with and equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobilise resources from the market which is common to both," goenka said.     a senior finance ministry official said government and private firms were free to compete to raise resources, adding it was not correct that public sector-issued bonds were preventing private firms from raising money on the stock market.     "debentures and equity shares floated by private companies still account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised in stock exchanges," the ministry official said.     a spokesman at bombay stock brokers batliwala and karani said government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees or about 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government and non-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.     the share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupees mobilised in 1985/86, he said. "to save taxes, commercial banks, mainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investing their surplus funds in the tax free bonds," he said.     "individuals who are very well off are also investing in the bonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are going for equities or debentures floated by private companies on a selective basis," the spokesman said.     the maturity period of government company bonds varies between seven and 10 years. no wealth or income taxes are payable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pct interest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^m exceeds 7,000 rupees a year.     equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and 12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by private companies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or from the tax on income earned from them.     the government bonds are listed as securities but traded on india's four major stock exchanges. they can be sold freely on the stock market by simple endorsement while debentures can only be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.     government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom in the stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal tax concessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.     the national thermal power corp, ntpc, was the first government company to issue the bonds to raise one billion rupees in january last year, breaking the monopoly of private companies on the capital market. the seven-year ntpc bond was oversubscribed three times, brokers said.     official figures show bonds floated by government companies have been heavily oversubscribed. more state companies have sought the ministry's permission to issue them in coming months.     ntpc's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51 billion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by the finance ministry.     the mahanagar telephone nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupees last year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month the indian railway finance corporation's record susbcription totalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.     in most cases, the government has allowed the companies to maintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.     goenka said that government bonds are making it increasingly difficult for private companies to launch new equity or debenture issues. he said the government could at least "fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised through such bonds by the public sector."     merchant bankers said the government is pressing state companies to borrow from the public by reducing financial support to them.     to ease its internal debt burden, the government has reduced the budgetary support to development investment in about 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in 1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figures show.  reuter &#3;</h3>
