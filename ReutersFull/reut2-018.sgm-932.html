	<h3>senate banking committee chairman william proxmire, d-wis, said a conference will be held with the house banking committee next week on a bill to refinance the federal savings and loan insurance corp.     the senate has passed a 7.5 billion dlr fslic refinancing, while the house approved five billion dlrs in new funds. the senate bill also bars new bank services until next march and bans so-called non-bank banks, provisions the house opposes.     fslic is virtually out of money to help ailing thrift institutions, according to the federal home loan bank board.  reuter &#3;</h3>
