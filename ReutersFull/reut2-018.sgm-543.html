	<h3>the joint committee of taiwan's soybean importers will reopen a tender tomorrow for two shipments of 54,000 to 66,000 tonnes of u.s. soybeans, a committee spokesman told reuters.      the committee rejected a tender today for a cargo of 27,000 to 33,000 tonnes on the grounds the prices offered by the u.s. suppliers were too high, he said.     the committee will be seeking a further shipment of between 27,000 and 33,000 tonnes when it reopens the tender tomorrow, he added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
