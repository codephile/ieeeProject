	<h3>murgold resources inc said the number three vein zone at its timmins, ontario property yielded partial assay results of 1.08 ounces gold a short ton across an average width of 4.2 feet and length of 200 feet.     it said many of the individual assays were more than one ounce a ton but had not been cut.     the company said these results were expected, because the structure was known from previous drilling as a narrow but very high-grade gold vein. its known length is 2,800 feet and will be explored and tested as part of the underground work, murgold said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
