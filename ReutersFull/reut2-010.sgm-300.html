	<h3>the u.s. has approved the sale of a u.s.-made supercomputer to india while rejecting its request for a more powerful model, the new york times reported.     india wanted to buy a powerful supercomputer, such as the cray x-mp with two processors running in tandem, but the times said u.s. officials offered a choice of machines with a single processor, several generations behind the cray x-mp.     the paper, citing unnamed u.s. officials, said the indian government was told of the decision last week, but has so far given no formal indication that it is interested in the type offered.     india had asked the u.s. for an modern supercomputer which it indicated would be used for scientific purposes, notably sophisticated weather forecasting.     however, india's close ties with the soviet union remains the main reason why the u.s. has restricted the sale of its state-of-the-art computer technology to india, the times said.     u.s. defence officials are particulalry concerned the soviet union could gain access to the supercomputer and use it to decipher high-level u.s. codes, while others say the computer could be very useful in designing nuclear weapons.  reuter &#3;</h3>
