	<h3>northern telecom ltd's u.s. unit will announce a reorganization today to form a new division focusing on sales and servicing of data communications equipment, spokesman richard lowe said.     the new division, called data communications and networks, will be formed effective may 1 and will market, sell and service data communications equipment, lowe said from northern telecom inc's nashville, tenn. headquarters.     the group will include the company's sales to the u.s. federal government and u.s. military, he said.     the u.s. unit's new division will also concentrate on sales to large end user customers who have a variety of equipment combined in one network, as well as data packet switching business for either public or private networks, northern telecom spokesman lowe said.     lowe said the company anticipates revenues from the new operating group will be about 350 mln dlrs in 1987, increasing to about one billion dlrs in five years.     "raising this to a group level within the company demonstrates the importance we see in this marketplace and the rapid growth that could occur there," lowe said.     lowe said the business of the new group was previously part of northern telecom inc's dallas-based private branch exchange division.     northern telecom inc accounted for about 65 pct of parent company northern telecom ltd's 1986 revenues of 4.38 billion dlrs.     northern telecom, north america's second largest telecommunications equipment designer and manufacturer, is 52 pct owned by bell canada enterprises inc <bce>.  reuter &#3;</h3>
