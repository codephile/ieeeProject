	<h3>former u.s. secretary of state henry kissinger said the u.s. government is disregarding the future of its economy and could within three to five years "find itself on a situation similar to those of indebted latin american countries."     "the united states will not be able to service its debt without austerity," he told a news conference.     the former secretary also criticised his country's foreign policy.     "we have so many problems of our own at home that we should not be sending people like me and many others around the world to tell other countries how to handle their problems."     kissinger came to brazil on a private visit to make the opening speech at the sixth world congress of the international federation of purchasing and materials management, to be held here june 24 through 26.     during his visit he is to call on president jose sarney, foreign minister roberto abreu sodre, finance minister luiz carlos bresser pereira and chamber of deputies chairman ulysses guimaraes, monday in brasilia.     asked to comment on the economic measures imposed by the brazilian government last week, which included a new price freeze up to 90 days, kissinger said: "i have only read a summary of the plan. in principle, it seems like a reasonable plan which could succeed and lead to an agreement with the international monetary fund."  reuter &#3;</h3>
