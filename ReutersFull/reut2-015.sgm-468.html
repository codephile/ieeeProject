	<h3>privately-held software developer sapc inc said it has filed suit in u.s. district court in boston against lotus development corp, alleging the infringement of a copyright and the misappropriation of trade secrets and is seeking 100 mln dlrs in damages.     the firm's suit alleges that lotus' spreadsheet program 1-2-3 violates the copyright of visicalc, which was developed by sapc several years ago, before 1-2-3 was introduced, when the firm was known as software arts inc.  software arts sold rights to visicalc to lotus in 1985 and changed its name.     the suit also alleges that lotus founder mitchell d. kapor, who resigned as chairman in july 1986, breached a confidentiality agreement with sapc.  kapor, also named as a defendant, had worked for a firm that had marketing rights to visicalc before founding lotus.     the suit alleges that lotus and kapor deliberately sought to make 1-2-3 look and feel like visicalc by copying a number of commands, keystrokes and screen displays.     lotus, in response, said it feels the suit is without merit.  reuter &#3;</h3>
