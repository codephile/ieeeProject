	<h3>morocco, buoyed by an economic turnaround and last week's paris club debt rescheduling, is likely to obtain over 100 mln dlrs worth of development aid at a meeting with donors beginning here tomorrow, john shilling, director of the world bank's moroccan division, said.     "a certain optimism has appeared in the economy to the effect that things are no longer impossible and morocco can get out of its problems ... we are aiming for 100 mln special drawing rights and if we can get more it will be put to good use," he told a news conference.     the agreement last week with the paris club of western creditors rescheduling over 10 years 900 mln dlrs worth of official debt due by mid-1988, together with an accord late last year to reschedule 1.8 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, had already encouraged donors to increase aid, he added.     debt sources said a world bank concessional loan of around 200 mln dlrs to help rationalise morocco's public sector was likely to be agreed in washington soon.  reuter &#3;</h3>
