	<h3>the recent deterioration in the steel market makes it important for arbed sa <arbb.br> to maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a statement.     it reported that its competitive position had weakened considerably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pct cut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mln tonnes.     arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit, slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks to lower raw material costs and prudent management, the company said.     arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market deteriorate further, but the decision of the european community to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally, should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.     ec ministers have agreed to extend a quota production system while discussions continue on an industry plan for capacity reductions.     arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting efforts remain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which have been built up over the last three years.  reuter &#3;</h3>
