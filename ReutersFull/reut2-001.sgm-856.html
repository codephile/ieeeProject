	<h3>rep. jack kemp, a new york republican, urged president reagan to oppose any legislation to impose a tax on stock transactions.     in a statement kemp called the tax "a money grab to permit democrats to begin another government spending spree."     "i call upon president reagan to signal immediately that he will veto any tax increase on stock transfers," kemp said. he added that the tax would punish the 50 million stockholders.     house speaker james wright, a texas democrat, has asked congressional tax analysts to look at a 0.25 to 0.5 pct tax on stock trades along with other tax proposals to help reduce the federal budget deficit.                  reuter &#3;</h3>
