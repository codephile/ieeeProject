	<h3>the european community is willing to offer limited concessions to the united states on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year, an ec commission spokesman said.     he said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter and ec external relations commissioner willy de clercq.     ec farm commissioner frans andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in luxembourg that the ec is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on u.s. exports of an ec plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones, the spokesman said.     washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the ec proceeds with the ban from january 1 and if european countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their airbus airliner which are harming u.s. manufacturers.     it claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year.     diplomatic sources said the yeutter-de clercq meeting will take place in london and will also involve the aerospace ministers of france, britain, west germany and spain, the countries involved in the airbus project.  reuter &#3;</h3>
