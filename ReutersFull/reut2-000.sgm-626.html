	<h3>chrysler corp <c> will begin exporting vehicles before the end of this year to europe, the world's second largest market, which it left in 1978.     robert lutz, executive vice president, told a news briefing: "after a lapse of almost nine years, chrysler is about to re-enter the european market. and we are here to stay."     michael hammes, vice president of international operations, said chrysler planned to market "a few hundred vehicles" by year end. "by the end of 1988, we hope to reach 5,000." the first cars would be sold in west germany, austria and switzerland, he said.     the european base would be in west germany, but no final decision had been made on other sites.     the company will not set up its own dealer franchises, but intends to work through distributors who will wholesale the vehicles to a franchised dealer organisation.     lutz commented, "we prefer to export to europe rather than manufacture here because it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of the favourable exchange rates due to the declining value of the dollar."     the vehicles, on show at this week's geneva motor show, include chrysler lebaron turbo coupe and convertible, the dodge lancer es four-door hatchback, the dodge shadow es compact, the plymouth voyager miniwagon and the dodge daytona shelby z.     chrysler is aiming for the mainstream european buyer, who appreciates sporty cars with 2.2 litre engines, officials said.     prior to negotiating a loan guarantee program with the u.s. government in 1978, chrysler sold its european operations to peugeot sa <peup.p>. chrysler now owns 24 pct of mitsubishi motors corp <mimt.t> and 15 pct of <maserati>, which may serve as european distribution channels in future, hammes said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
