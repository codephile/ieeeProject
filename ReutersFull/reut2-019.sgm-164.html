	<h3>ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather, the official ghana news agency (gna) reported today.     secretary for finance and economic planning kwesi botchwey made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a japanese food aid programme.     the lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows government concern over "lower than average rainfall in southern ghana and its implications for the major harvest."     botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing areas throughout the south this year. the ministry of agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.     gna quoted botchwey as saying that while the consequences of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.     the failure of seasonal rains has already seriously affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts of the central and volta regions of ghana where rivers have dried up.  reuter &#3;</h3>
