	<h3>prime minister bob hawke said he would not call snap elections although disarray within the opposition was a strong temptation to do so.     confirming earlier comments by government officials, hawke told reporters in canberra: "i am confident that labour would win an early election. i have decided, however, that the election will be held towards the end of this year or early next year.     "the australian people want continued strong leadership and a government that will continue to guide them through difficult economic times into renewed prosperity."  reuter &#3;</h3>
