	<h3>china welcomed a u.s. supreme court decision dismissing claims by holders of 41 mln dlrs of pre-1949 chinese bonds, but u.s. officials said peking has a long way to go before it can issue bonds in the u.s.      a foreign ministry spokesman told a news briefing that china welcomed a monday court ruling, which rejected a petition by holders of railway bonds issued in 1911 by the ruling qing dynasty, which the communist government does not acknowledge.      the spokesman said the ruling "indicates the ... railway bearer bonds case is finally closed."     but a u.s. embassy official said that two other bond cases were still in litigation and it was not known if the other courts involved would accept the supreme court ruling.     china has issued much of its recent overseas debt in japan, and has been badly hit by the yen's sharp rise. a western banker said the u.s. market has become more attractive to china, since it is likely to issue bonds denominated in currencies other than yen, and so protect itself against future currency fluctuations.     but a western diplomat warned that potential u.s. buyers would not give china the warm reception it received in japan.     "u.s. investors are not interested in china per se, as many japanese are. china has no track record in the u.s. bond market. investors may demand disclosure of information chinese institutions are unwilling to give," he said.     he said potential buyers might scrutinise china's human rights record. some institutions are reportedly concerned about recent events in china, including a drive by the chinese media against "bourgeois liberalism."     an official of state-owned china international trust and investment corp, which has raised funds in hong kong, tokyo and frankfurt, declined comment on the court decision.  reuter &#3;</h3>
