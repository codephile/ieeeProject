	<h3>canadian tire corp ltd said it still hopes a special board committee can solve a voting rights dispute between class a and common stock shareholders.     "although no such proposal has yet been developed, the directors hope that such a result can be achieved," chairman hugh macaulay said at the annual meeting.     the committee, formed last fall, has been trying to determine the voting rights of class a non-voting shares if control of the company changes hands.         the ontario securities commission blocked a 270 mln dlr takeover bid last january for 49 pct of the company's common shares.     the osc said the bid by a group of canadian tire store owners abused shareholders rights by circumventing share provisions that would convert non-voting stock into voting shares if more than 50 pct of the stock changed ownership.     since then, three members of the billes family, who agreed to tender their 60 pct holding of canadian tire's common shares to the pro rata offer, have commenced legal proceedings amongst themselves.     macaulay said he would not comment further on the situation "while matters remain in an unsettled state".     at the meeting, president dean groussman said the higher profit trend evident in the first quarter ended april 4 was continuing. first quarter net rose 10 pct to 21.1 mln dlrs from 19.2 mln dlrs a year earlier.     groussman also said the company plans sharply higher capital spending this year of 103 mln dlrs, compared to 43 mln dlrs last year, and it will likely maintain high levels of capital investment in 1988 and 1989.  reuter &#3;</h3>
