	<h3>the average tax rate for canadian financial insitutions will increase to 21.3 pct from 14.5 pct under the new tax reform package, the federal finance department said.      the amount of financial institutions' income that is taxed will also increase to 74.0 pct from 48.7 pct, it said in documents tabled with finance minister michael wilson's prepared speech to the house of commons.      under wilson's plan, the federal government will collect 1.36 billion dlrs more over the next five years from financial insitutions, including banks, trust mortgage and life insurance companies, according to finance department documents.      financial institutions "are going to complain, but we believe the changes are appropriate and affordable," said one finance department official who asked not to be identified.      ottawa will collect more revenue from financial institutions by reducing the amount of reserves they can deduct from taxes, which "will broaden the tax base for this low tax paying sector," the finance department said.      among the changes, chartered banks will no longer be able to use a five-year averaging formula to calculate loan losses that may be deducted for tax purposes.      effective june 17, 1987, banks will deduct bad or doubtful loans during the year they are incurred.      the finance department said the impact of the new provisions will be cushioned over a period of five years.      the changes are needed to ensure that all financial companies are taxed fairly under deregulation of the financial services industry.      "it would be inconsistent for the tax system to continue to provide different reserves for tax purposes for institutions competing in the same marketplace," the finance department said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
