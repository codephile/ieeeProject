	<h3>financial and industrial holding company nord est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of 400 mln francs, president gustave rambaud said.     he told a news conference nord-est expected to receive approval from the bourse supervisory body cob in the next two week, when terms would set according to market conditions.     he said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new investments.     rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25 francs, unchanged on 1985. parent company net profit last year rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985.     provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against 147 mln, was attributable to the group. he said the lower profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker vallourec, in which nord est has a 12.5 pct stake.     rambaud said he forecast a 1987 parent company net profit before provisions of around 135 mln francs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
