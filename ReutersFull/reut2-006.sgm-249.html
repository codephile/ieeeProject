	<h3>house budget committee chairman william gray, d-pa, said he would propose a freeze on all spending for federal government programs for the fiscal 1988 budget to meet budget deficit targets.     "an outlay freeze -- with no additional revenues -- produces almost enough savings to reach the 108 billion dlr deficit target. for fiscal 1988, this would mean total spending of just over 1 trillion dlrs," gray said in a statement.     gray said his plan would call for a freeze in spending on each individual federal program at fiscal 1987 levels.     he said this would mean numerous program cuts, lower benefits for recipients of federal assistance and fewer people being served by federal programs.     gray said he would make the budget freeze proposal when the house budget committee begins work on the budget resolution this thursday. the senate budget committee began work on its budget resolution this afternoon.  reuter &#3;</h3>
