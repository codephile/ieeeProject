	<h3>standard and poor's said that currently 17 finance units benefit from parent relationships by receiving higher ratings than their financial performance alone would merit.     by drawing on its parent company's strength, a weaker finance subsidiary can achieve a credit rating as high as its parent.  an independent finance company on the other hand must operate within more stringent guidelines than a unit and is at a competitive disadvantage, s and p said.      the agency rates a finance unit on its creditworthiness  as well as the support agreement it has with its parent.     standard and poor's said that some finance subsidiaries have formal support agreements with the parent company which obligate the parent to maintain the unit's net worth.  the agreement assures that the unit meets its obligations on time and requires it to operate within specific guidelines.     others have less formal agreements with the parent like general electric credit corp <ge> whose aaa rating reflects its parent's, general electric co.  but ge injected sizeable equity into the unit at timely intervals, s and p noted.     these agreements are being tested as finance firms expand, and s and p said it will review a unit that violates the pact.  reuter &#3;</h3>
