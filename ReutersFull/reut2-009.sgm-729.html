	<h3>the bank of france said it set a money market intervention tender today to inject funds to the market against first category paper.     money market sources said the surprise announcement might herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank intervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set march 10, but they added such a cut was relatively unlikely.     the intervention rate was cut from eight pct on march 10 after being raised from 7-1/4 pct on january 2 to head off speculative pressure against the franc.     dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further easing, but a combination of technical factors and renewed currency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put short-term upside pressure on interest rates in recent sessions.     call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8 pct. today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on news of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct.     technical factors making for a slight shortage of liquidity in the market included the settlement yesterday of the latest monthly treasury tap stock tender, on march 5, market sources said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
