	<h3>the economy will grow by an average rate of 2.2 pct a year in real terms between now and the end of 1991, westdeutsche landesbank girozentrale (westlb) said in an annual report.     a year ago westlb had forecast average growth of just under three pct for 1986-1990.     the 1987 report said gross national product would only expand a real 1.7 pct this year -- below previous expectations -- because of weaker exports. growth rates will pick up later, however, producing a 2.2 pct increase on average for the five-year period.  more &#3;</h3>
