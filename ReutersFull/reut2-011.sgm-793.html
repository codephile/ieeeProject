	<h3>the bank of england said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a shortage of around 1.2 billion stg in the money market today.     among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills for repurchase by the market will drain some 526 mln stg while bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will remove around 1.79 billion stg. a rise in note circulation will take out a further 105 mln stg.     partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add around 1.01 billion stg and bankers' balances above target some 185 mln stg.  reuter &#3;</h3>
