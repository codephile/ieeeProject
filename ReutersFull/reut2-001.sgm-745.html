	<h3>president reagan, fighting to recover politically from the iran-contra scandal, plans to acknowledge in a critical speech to the nation tonight he needs to change his ways, administration officials said.     "it will be a forward-looking speech in which he will say he accepts the need for change," said an official who asked not to be identified. "i think the president wants to give his side of the story."     the official said reagan would tell the public what he is doing to set things right in the wake of last week's scorching tower commission report on the origins of the scandal.     it is not clear whether reagan will heed the advice of many of his political allies and acknowledge that his iran policy was wrong and he personally made some mistakes.     asked at his daily news briefing if the president would say he erred, white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters, "his views are intensely personal and i won't give you any advance on what he intends to say in that area."     he said the speech would be 12 or 13 minutes in length and that reagan would "look beyond the horizon to a revitalized white house that will pursue an active foreign policy."     "the president will discuss the tower board report and its recommendations. he'll focus on changes he's making in the structure of the nsc (national security council) and his goals for the next two years," the spokesman said.     to date, reagan has defended his decision to sell arms to iran and conceded only there were errors in implementation.     senate republican leader robert dole said tonight's speech might be reagan's last chance to repair his presidency.     "it's about the ninth inning ... he has to try and set us on another course. it's hard to do that, he probably won't be able to do it," dole told reporters.  reuter &#3;</h3>
