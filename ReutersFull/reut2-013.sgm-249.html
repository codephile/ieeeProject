	<h3>a consortium headed by the construction group bouygues sa has been awarded a 50-pct controlling stake in french state television network tf1, which stock market analysts said represented a major boost for bouygues.     the bouygues-led consortium was widely regarded as the less likely of the two candidates in contention to be awarded the three billion franc stake by the national commission for communications and liberties (nccl), the french television watchdog authority.     the losing candidate was a consortium headed by publishing group hachette sa <hacp.pa>.     the nccl decision awarded the bouygues consortium a 50-pct controlling stake in a company which will have a 10-year operating concession for tf1, france's oldest and most widely watched television network.     independent market analysis group c.o.p.s. in a note on bouygues said the award would represent a major diversification for the group out of the highly cyclical construction industry into the rapidly expanding media business.     bouygues in february said it estimated 1986 group net attributable profit at 480 mln francs, up from 443 mln for 1985, on consolidated turnover of 45.8 billion francs, up from 26.3 billion.     the sharp rise in turnover reflected the groups acquisition of the loss-making screg construction group last year.     bouygues closed on the paris stock market at 1,451 francs on friday, up from 1,405 the previous day, but well below its year's high of 1,475.     hachette closed at 3,280, up from a previous 3,250.     bouygues holds a 50-pct stake in the winning consortium, giving it a 25-pct stake in tf1.     the u.k.-based <pergamon media trust> of robert maxwell has a 20-pct stake in the consortium, representing a 10 pct stake in tf1, while <maxwell media france> has a six pct stake, or three pct of the television network.     minority shareholders in the consortium include the <gmf/fnac> group, societe generale <sgen.pa>, <editions mondiale>, the <groupe bernard tapie>, <financiere faltas>, <banque indosuez> and credit lyonnais <crlp.pa>.     the remaining 50 pct of tf1 is to be split between a 40-pct stake to be offered to the general public and a 10-pct stake to be offered to employees.  reuter &#3;</h3>
