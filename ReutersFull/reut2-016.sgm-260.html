	<h3>cecos international inc, a subsidiary of browning-ferris industries inc, said it expects the u.s. environmental protection agency to sue the company, claiming non-compliance with regulatory requirements at cecos' livingston, louisiana hazardous waste treatment plant.     cecos said the epa advised the company it intendend to seek a penalty in the range of five mln dlrs to 10 mln dlrs.     cecos said it considered the proposed penalty to be "grossly excessive" and has offered 125,000 dlrs in earlier negotiations to settle the disputed issues.     cecos said it believes strongly that the epa's claims and proposed remedies concerning the livingston waste disposal site are unreasonable.     the company also said its 125,000 dlr settlement offer was consistent with monetary penalties previously accepted by the epa concerning disputes over other hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal operations.     cecos said major issues of the dispute include the livingston waste site's analysis and operation plans, inspection records and freeboard limits of rainwawater holding impoundments.  reuter &#3;</h3>
