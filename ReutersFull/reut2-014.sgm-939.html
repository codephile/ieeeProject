	<h3>west germany should take steps to increase its official development assistance, the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) said.     a report by the organisation's development assistance committee (dac) said german aid levels had shown only a moderate increase in real terms in recent years, adding that there was a risk that growth over the next few years might slow further.     german aid, estimated at around four billion dlrs in 1986, represents 0.46 pct of the country's gnp. this is above the dac's average of 0.36 pct, but might decline if corrective measures were not taken, the report said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
