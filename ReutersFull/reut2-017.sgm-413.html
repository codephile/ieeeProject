	<h3>reuters holdings plc said shareholders approved changes in the company's articles of association to allow it to seek a listing on the tokyo stock exchange.     the shareholders also approved a stock option plan tied to performance. the plan allows grants of options up to eight times earnings to a small group of executives, the company said.     the shareholders approved the measures at a special meeting following the company's annual meeting.     the amendment allowing the tokyo listing exempts the <japan securities clearing corp> from a 15 pct shareholding limit contained in the articles of association.     under rules of the tokyo exchange, shares in foreign companies owned by japanese must be registered in the name of japan securities clearing or its nominee, the company said.     reuters, based in london, supplies a wide range of information services to business and news media subscribers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
