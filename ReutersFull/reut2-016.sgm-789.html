	<h3>u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng has asked japan to open its farm market further to help washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures, an agriculture ministry official told reporters.     hideo maki, director general of the ministry's economic affairs bureau, quoted lyng as telling agriculture minister mutsuki kato that the removal of import restrictions would help japan as well as the united states.     the meeting with kato opened a 12-day visit to japan by lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.     however, maki quoted kato as replying that japan was already the world's largest grain importer.     kato added japan is the largest customer for u.s. grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985.     lyng said the u.s. put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in u.s. complaints against japan to the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) last year, as well as on beef, citrus products and rice.     kato said japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand.     the world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries, he added.     lyng said the u.s. has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs, maki said.     maki said the u.s. and japan will hold detailed discussions on each trade item as well as a new round of gatt trade talks at a meeting on april 20, in which u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter will join.  reuter &#3;</h3>
