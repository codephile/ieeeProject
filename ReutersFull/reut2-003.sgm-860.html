	<h3>chrysler corp today sold 405 mln dlrs of corporate bonds from its nearly 3.5 billion dlr pension fund to wall street investment bankers, vice president and treasurer fred zuckerman said.     he said this was the first of two planned sales of corporate issues from the fund's portfolio. zuckerman said chrysler will sell slightly less than one billion dlrs of corporates.     "phase two (the second sale) will be in a month or so," the chrysler executive said, adding that proceeds will be invested exclusively in the equities market.     before today's sale of corporate bonds, those securities had comprised roughly two thirds of the pension fund portfolio.     "after the two sales, equities will amount to 50 pct or more of the portfolio," zuckerman said.     "we believe that the equity market has much more upside potential than the bond market," the executive said. "interest rates are not coming down and i would not bet a lot that they will drop sharply."     he added, "i personally think interest rates may decline by 50 basis points at the most this year."     zuckerman said the 405 mln dlr bond sale was composed of 139 separate issues.     "sixty pct were utilities, 20 pct were issued by foreign governments or corporations, and 20 pct were financial institutions," he detailed.     the chrysler treasurer said that the corporate paper had typically an 18-year maturity. "the securities were long-term, high-quality bonds, mostly rated aa-minus or a-plus," he said.     zuckerman said chrysler sold the corporate bonds at about 1.6 pct above yesterday's closing prices for these issues. "that showed our portfolio is desirable," he commented.     corporate bond traders noted that chrysler's sale occurred against the backdrop of a slightly weak secondary market.     they said they believed that chrysler was sold the corporates at a large profit because the issues were bought by the automaker for its portfolio when interest rates were much higher.     chrysler's zuckerman said his company sold the corporate issues to four large wall street securities firms.     he said that morgan stanley and co inc and salomon brothers inc bought most of the bonds. however, zuckerman declined to name the other two houses.     yesterday, chrysler presented four investment bankers with a list of bonds and asked them to submit bids by this morning.     zuckerman said that morgan stanley bought more corporate bonds than any one of the other three houses.     wall street sources said they believed first boston corp and merrill lynch capital markets were also in on the bidding for the corporate bonds. they believed these two firms were awarded bonds by the carmaker as well.     a spokesman for morgan declined to comment and referred inquiries to chrysler. officials at salomon, first boston and merrill lynch were unavailable for immediate comment.  reuter &#3;</h3>
