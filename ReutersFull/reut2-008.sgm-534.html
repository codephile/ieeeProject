	<h3>u.s. agriculture undersecretary dan amstutz indicated the united states is willing talk with the soviet union about the competitiveness of u.s. wheat prices but would not discuss making u.s. wheat prices "cheap."     "there sometimes is a difference between being competitive and being cheap," amstutz told a senate agriculture appropriations hearing.     amstutz said the difference of opinion between moscow and washington last summer on the level of the u.s. subsidy offered on wheat to the soviet union, was over whether the u.s. wheat price was competitive or cheap.     "i think there is a (u.s.) willingness to explore this issue as it pertains to competitiveness," amstutz said.     however, amstutz added that the united states would not be willing to discuss wheat prices with moscow "if the issue is being cheap."     asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction between competitive and cheap, amstutz would not elaborate.     amstutz said it is the u.s. judgment that the long-term grain agreement between the two countries calls for moscow to buy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at "prices in effect in this country."     amstutz made the comments in response to a question from sen. charles grassley, r-iowa, about expanding the export enhancement program to include grain sales to the soviet union.  reuter &#3;</h3>
