	<h3>the central bank issued 4.03 billion taiwan dlrs of certificates of deposit (cds), bringing cd issues so far this year to 134.5 billion dlrs, a bank official told reuters.     the new cds, with maturities of six months, one and two years, carry interest rates ranging from 4.07 to 5.12 pct, he said.     the issues are intended to help curb the growth of m-1b money supply, which is the result of large foreign exchange reserves.     the reserves are now well over 51 billion u.s. dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
