	<h3>the agreement between the u.s. and the european community (ec) on special imports of maize and sorghum provides an equal chance for all non-ec countries to supply the spanish market, an ec commission spokeswoman said.     she denied that any unpublished clause of the agreement guaranteed the bulk of the maize export business would go to the u.s., as one ec official told reuters yesterday.     under the agreement, the ec will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year into spain at specially reduced levy rates for the next four years.     the commission has yet to decide whether the maize will come in through direct purchases by the spanish intervention board or by a tender system.  reuter &#3;</h3>
