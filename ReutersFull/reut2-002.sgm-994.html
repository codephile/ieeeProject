	<h3>the value of china's industrial output in january and february this year was 14.1 pct higher than in the same 1986 period, the new china news agency said.     output increased by 5.6 pct from january 1985 to january 1986 and 0.9 pct from february 1985 to 1986.     the agency said the most recent increase was largely due to last year's poor performance. "no significant improvement was made in economic results," it said, adding that some successes were reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in the last quarter of 1986.     the agency said the amount of tied up working capital rose and sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986.     it quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987 industrial production to increase at a proper rate and with better results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway throughout the country. it gave no more details.     the official industrial growth target this year is seven pct, down from an actual 9.2 pct last year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
