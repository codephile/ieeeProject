	<h3>u.s. secretary of state george shultz forecast a golden future for the philippines after talks on its struggle for economic recovery and its fight against communist insurgents.     speaking at a luncheon after an hour-long meeting with president corazon aquino, shultz delivered a powerful and uncompromising endorsement of the manila government.     "there is a golden future out there for the filipino people to gain," he said. but he tempered his praise with a veiled hint washington's attitude might change if what it called the current realism was seen to be diluted.     "the political dreams of only 18 months ago are becoming the democratic institutions of today," shultz said. "your economy is developing an impressive head of steam, the insurgents are learning that threats and intimidation will not stop the filipino people from voting for democracry."     he said he had been struck by the widespread awareness of the problems facing the philippines.     "no one i have met under-estimates the tasks which lie ahead or the need to act upon them. that filipino realism is an essential element of american confidence in the philippines," he said.     shultz said the revolution which brought aquino to power 18 months ago was still under way.     he praised the efforts made by the armed forces in combatting the communist insurgency, now in its 18th year, adding that aquino was also addressing the social and economic problems fuelling the rebellion.     defence minister rafael ileto, briefing reporters after a separate meeting with shultz, said the u.s. was just as confident as he was that the communists would be beaten.     u.s. officials made it clear before the start of today's talks that they expected no dramatic developments.  reuter &#3;</h3>
