	<h3>international cablecasting technologies inc, said it introduced its proprietary new technology that can broadcast compact disk-quality digital sound into the home.     the company said the new technology, called digital modulation, permits noise-free, undistorted transmission of 10 channels of pure digital sound or data via satellite and cable into subscribers' homes, all on a single video channel.         according to the company, the first consumer service to be offered by international via the new technology will be supersound, a package of eight 24-hour commercial-free digital uninterrupted music channels to subscribers.     international said the supersound service is expected to be launched in late 1987 and generally available by early 1988.  reuter &#3;</h3>
