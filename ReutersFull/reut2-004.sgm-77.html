	<h3>the french 1986 current account balance of payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 25.8 billion francs from the 25.4 billion franc figure announced last month, the finance ministry said.     this compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and while it is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower than the 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialist government before they lost office in march last year.     net long-term capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billion francs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to a major program of foreign debt repayment, the ministry said.     in the fourth quarter alone the unadjusted surplus rose to 14.1 billion francs from 6.6 billion the previous quarter, but the adjusted surplus fell to 7.4 billion from 9.1 billion.     fourth quarter medium and long-term foreign debt repayments exceeded new credits by 11 billion francs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
