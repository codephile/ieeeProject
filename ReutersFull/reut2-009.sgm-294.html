	<h3>the bundesbank bought large amounts of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar above 149 yen, dealers said.     the dollar intervention was in concert with some other central banks, they said.     dealers said the bank of japan and bank of england supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that these two banks and the u.s. federal reserve were also active yesterday.     the bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks.     dealers said the intervention underlined the determination of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges following last month's agreement in paris by six leading countries to foster currency stability.     one dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy dollars after the japanese and u.k. central bank moves.     he said the bundesbank told him it was observing the situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with other central banks.     since the paris agreement on february 22 the dollar had until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above 150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test central banks' resolve to defend currency stability.     but the test came this week with the dollar falling below 1.81 marks and 150 yen. dealers said a reviving trade dispute between washington and tokyo and growing sentiment that the dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate u.s. trade deficit were behind the weakness.     this week's intervention showed central banks were prepared to cooperate to defend the paris pact, dealers said.     dealers said it was significant the west german and british central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen.     that showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by central banks to foster currency stability, they said.     but it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged and how frequent consultations between central banks were.  reuter &#3;</h3>
