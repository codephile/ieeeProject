	<h3>a former trw inc controller told a congressional hearing that the company had acted unethically in its defense contracts with the government.     "it is my contention that the company called trw is not ever vigilant and highly ethical as a defense contractor. trw only pretends to be an honest citizen when that scheme best fits their financial interests," larry eagleye said in testimony at a house oversight subcommittee hearing.     eagleye was a controller at trw's compressor components division in cleveland.     subcommittee chairman john dingell, d-mich, said he did not understand why the defense department had taken no action against trw even though it admitted in the 1984 report that it had substantially overcharged the government for military aircraft parts.     "in 1984, trw officials admitted to the defense department inspector general that they had evidence of two sets of books and other problems in one of the company's divisions in cleveland and that there had been substantial overcharging of the federal government on various military aircraft parts," dingell said.     "for example, by falsifying its books and records, trw inflated the price of a military engine blade by two to three times higher than the price of a virtually identical commercial engine blade," dingell said in a statement.     eagleye and two other former employees filed a suit against trw last year charging the company with overcharging the government. the justice department later joined the suit.     "while employed by trw and while under investigation by trw, i disclosed to trw's legal department and higher management, many flagrant and obvious violations of law, company policy and ethical conduct. none of this evidence was included in trw's (1984) report to the government," he said.      reuter &#3;</h3>
