	<h3>fw woolworth co's chairman and chief executive officer, harold sells, said the company remains commmitted to its general merchandise division, despite the growing importance of its specialty stores.     the company said its sales in the first quarter ended may 2 were 1.53 billion dlrs, up from 1.41 billion dlrs in the same period last year.         sells said the company's specialty stores contributed 65 pct to total operating profit last year, but profits in the general merchandise sector have been improving. he said the company has no plans to turn its back on the woolworth stores.     "we've spent alot of money on refurbishing and remodeling our general merchandise stores, and we will continue to do so," he said.     sells said the number of general merchandise stores is not increasing. but one of the companies stratagies is to increase its core departments in the general merchandise stores into specialty stores, he said.     he said these include its framescene and cosmetics unit.     he said the company continues to look at mergers and acquisitions. but he stressed any acquisitions should make sense from a strategy standpoint.     "we're primarily looking for small, emerging growth stores with a concept that's right to expand on national scale," he said.        sells said the company has been looking at a number of initial experiments on home video sales. he said woolworth will become involved this summer with j.c. penny co inc's <jcp> tele-action program, along with a number of other retailers.     sells said the tele-action program, which is due to go on air in the chicago area this summer, will feature products from woolworth's foot locker unit.  reuter &#3;</h3>
