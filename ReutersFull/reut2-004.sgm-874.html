	<h3>talks between france and iran on the repayment of a one billion dlr loan by the late shah have made progress, roland dumas, head of a parliamentary foreign affairs committee said.     "they are progressing as far as i have heard," dumas told reporters. "the two delegations appear to be near an agreement on the figures."     dumas, a close aide to president francois mitterrand, earlier this week met iranian charge d'affaires in paris haddadi gholam-reza.     the report of progress contrasts with official french statements last month after talks between deputy iranian finance minister mehdi navvab and the french finance ministry.     the talks, the latest round in long-running negotiations between the two countries, were said to have led to little progress on the loan repayment issue.     france made a first repayment of 330 mln dlrs last november. since then negotiatiors have shuttled between tehran and paris for talks which france hopes will help secure freedom for hostages held by pro-iranian groups in lebanon.     iran is claiming full repayment of principal and interest on the shah's loan, made in 1975 to the eurodif uranium enrichment consortium. it has also asked france to curb the activities of iranian dissidents in france and stop selling weapons to iraq, its enemy in the gulf war.     france for its part has made a counter claim for more than 500 mln dlrs in compensation for contracts with french firms broken after the 1979 revolution.  reuter &#3;</h3>
