	<h3>kuwait's oil exports have not been affected by the seven-year iran-iraq war, kuwait oil tanker company (kotc) chairman and managing director abdul fattah al-bader told a kuwaiti newspaper.     "kuwait has exploited all available opportunities to continue exporting its oil without any reduction," the al-anbaa newspaper quoted him as saying.     he said kotc made profits of more than two mln dinars (seven mln dlrs) in the fiscal year ending last june, but predicted lower profits this year due to higher costs for chartering and operating vessels.  reuter &#3;</h3>
