	<h3>an extension of the sixth international tin agreement, ita, for one or two years beyond june 30 is increasingly likely, international tin council, itc, delegates said following a special council session today.     a formal decision will be taken at the quarterly council session on april 8-9 when decisions are needed on the budget and activities for the year beginning july one, they stated.     delegates said most countries now favour a continued legal itc presence to answer the still unresolved legal disputes over the outstanding debts of its buffer stock with court hearings likely to continue well after the june 30 expiry of the pact.     the itc was informally told of the appeal made yesterday by amalgamated metal trading ltd, amt, against the january court ruling against it in the legal bid it led on behalf of itc creditor brokers to have the itc wound up.     in january the judge ruled that the u.k. court had no jurisdiction to wind up the tin council, the itc was not an association within the meaning of the u.k. companies act, and the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect in respect of an arbitration award.     amt is appealing on all points and has said it is important for the court to accept that a winding-up petition is a move to enforce an arbitration ruling.  reuter &#3;</h3>
