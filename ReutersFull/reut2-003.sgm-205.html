	<h3>japanese crushers bought 5,000 to 7,000 tonnes of canadian rapeseed in export business over the weekend for april shipment, trade sources said.     japanese crushers continue to concentrate on rapeseed purchases since it converts to a higher percentage of oil than other oilseeds, they said. a glut of feed meals makes other oilseeds, such as soybeans, less desirable because they would add to already large meal stocks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
