	<h3>the federal trade commission said its staff has urged the governor of georgia to veto a bill that would prohibit petroleum refiners from owning and operating retail gasoline stations.     the proposed legislation is aimed at preventing large oil refiners and marketers from using predatory or monopolistic practices against franchised dealers.     but the ftc said fears of refiner-owned stations as part of a scheme of predatory or monopolistic practices are unfounded. it called the bill anticompetitive and warned that it would force higher gasoline prices for georgia motorists.  reuter &#3;</h3>
