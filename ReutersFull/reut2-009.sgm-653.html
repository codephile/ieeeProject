	<h3>brazilian coffee institute (ibc) president jorio dauster said he will not attend the ico executive board meeting and was surprised to hear that a report of his absence had a slightly depressing effect on the new york coffee market today.     "i have too much work to accomplish here in brazil at the moment. besides the presence of the ibc president at an ico executive board meeting is not a tradition," dauster said.     dauster said except in rare cases, brazil has always sent its london-based representative to ico board meetings. ambassador lindenberg sette will attend the meeting, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
