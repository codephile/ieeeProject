	<h3>treasury secretary james baker urged commercial banks to be open to new ideas for reducing the third world debt burden.     "i believe the commercial banks need to be open to creative ideas for reducing the debt burden," baker told the annual meeting of the inter-american development bank.     but he said that he was confident banks would make "substantial new lending" to the major debtors this year.     he pointed out principal debtor nations are expected to grow an average 3.5 pct this year, the fastest real rate of growth since 1980.     saying the u.s. debt strategy was making "substantial headway", baker said import volumes of debtor countries are forecast to jump over six pct in 1987 and export volumes almost five pct -- the best performance in three years.     he also said economic growth has kept pace with or surpassed the growth in debt for nine of the 15 major debtors since 1983.     "this is a start -- and i venture to say a good one," the treasury secretary said, and he urged the audience of western and latin finance officials and bankers to stand fast against suggestions of solutions like debt relief.     while such ideas have political appeal, baker said, they would mean a drying up of capital flowing to debtors.     and even if free market reforms followed, debt fogiveness would frighten away investors who would not "risk their capital in a country which abandoned its obligations."     and he said, "a debt forgiveness plan that damages commercial banks also weakens confidence in world financial stability."     he cautioned that resolving the debt situation would be a "gradual and painstaking" process, varying from country to country.     reporting on the u.s. debt strategy, baker said attitudes in debtor nations have changed and there is much greater acceptance of free market reforms than hitherto.     some countries like argentina are pursuing anti-inflation programs. others, like the philippines and chile, are privatizing companies and swapping debt for equity.     the international monetary fund and world bank, meanwhile, have committed nearly 12 billion dlrs in loans for the 15 major debtor nations since late 1985, official creditors have rescheduled 14.5 billion dlrs in outstanding loans through the paris club, while commercial banks are making new loans.     baker pointed out the banks have rescheduld nearly 70 billion dlrs of debt, reaching agreements recently with chile, venezuela and mexico.     elsewhere in his speech, baker outlined the progress industrial nations are making in promoting moderate global growth, low inflation and efforts to reduce massive trade imbalances.     he maintained world economic conditions were "continuuing to improve" a development that would provide a positive backdrop for debtor nations.  reuter &#3;</h3>
