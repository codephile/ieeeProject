	<h3>white house budget director james miller said a budget plan drafted by senate budget chairman lawton chiles (d-fla.) was "seriously deficient."     in a statement, miller called the senator's proposal for the government's fiscal 1988 budget would cut u.s. defense spending authority by more than 25 billion dlrs from president reagan's request, resulting in a real reduction of military spending authority for the third year in a row.     while the plan would allow actual 1988 defense spending to rise by 5.6 billion dlrs, domestic spending would be increased by a disprportionate 42.7 billion dlrs, he said.     miller also criticized the chiles plan's call for a 13.6 billion dlr tax increase.     "the president has said repeatedly that he would veto any tax increase," miller said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
