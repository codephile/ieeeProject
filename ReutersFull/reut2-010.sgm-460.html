	<h3>the u.k. treasury issued to the bank of england 250 mln stg in two tranches of existing index-linked stocks, for first dealings on monday, the bank said.     the issues are 150 mln stg of 2-1/2 pct index-linked treasury stock due 2011 and 100 mln of 2-1/2 pct index-linked treasury due 2024. the latter stock is free of tax to residents abroad (fotra).     the bonds will be available to the u.k. government bond market from monday at certified prices of 113.00 stg pct for the 2-1/2s of 2011 and 85-24/32 stg pct for the 2-1/2s of 2024.     several dealers had expected the bank of england to announce further issues of index-linked bonds today in the light of strength seen in this sector of the market over the past few days. some prices advanced by as much as 1-1/2 points yesterday as the rest of the market eased back further.     however, one or two traders expressed surprise that the authorities had issued further bonds of any kind in the light of the nervous conditions prevailing in the market.     in such relatively small amounts, the new issues were unlikely to have a significantly harmful effect on government bond prices in general, dealers said.     prices of index-linked bonds fell back slightly after the stock tranches were announced, with the 2-1/2 pct index-linked stock due 2016 quoted at 102-25/32 stg pct after 102-29/32 shortly before the announcement.  reuter &#3;</h3>
