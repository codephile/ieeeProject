	<h3>salomon inc has lowered its investment ratings on all u.s. money center banks, institutional sources said.     the sources said salomon believes that other money center banks may feel compelled to follow citicorp's <cci> lead in its filing with the securities and exchange commission relating to its loan exposure to brazil.     they also said salomon believes that other banks may strongly consider the possibility of placing brazilian loans on a non-accruing status with the consequent negative impact on earnings.     the sources said the ratings were lowered to m from o-plus. the stock are now expected to match the standard and poor's 500 index, rather than outperform the index as previously expected.     the sources said it is also understood that the change in the coding of these stocks should definitely not be taken as a sell-recommendation because salomon is said to believe that its downgrading will only prove temporary.     the banks affected by the change in investment coding are bank of new york co inc <bk>, bankers trust co <bt>, chase manhattan corp <cmb>, chemical new york corp <chl>, citicorp <cci>, irving bank corp <v>, manufacturers hanover corp <mhc>, j.p. morgan and co inc <jpm>, marine midland banks inc <mm>, republic new york corp <rnb>, bank of boston corp <bkb> and first chicago corp <fnb>.     the institutional sources said that thomas hanley, a director of salomon inc subsidiary salomon brothers who is in charge of bank stock research, believes citicorp's move is well-timed.     should citicorp actually place the brazilian loans in a non-performing category at the end of this quarter this action would serve to alleviate the urgency associated with the debt negotiations, he argues.     thus citicorp's bargaining position would appear to have been much enhanced.  reuter &#3;</h3>
