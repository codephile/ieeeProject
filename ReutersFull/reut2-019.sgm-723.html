	<h3>apollo computer inc said the price cuts announced earlier today on its domain series 3000 computer workstations average 35 pct to 50 pct.     an apollo spokesman said the cuts bring prices to under 5,000 dlrs for some series 3000 models.     in addition to reducing prices, the company said it added new monochrome and color models to the series 3000 line that improve its performance and graphics capabilities.     the company made the price cuts along with the introduction of a more powerful family of workstations, the domain series 4000.         industry analysts had expected apollo to reprice the series 3000 in response to aggressive price cuts made two weeks ago by digital equipment corp <dec> on its competing workstations.     but the apollo spokesman said the reductions had been planned for some time. "we haven't just cut prices," he added, noting that the company had improved the series 3000 models.     analysts have said they also expect sun microsystems inc <sunw.o>, apollo's biggest rival in the workstation market, to cut prices and introduce new models. sun has scheduled a new conference on july eight.  reuter &#3;</h3>
