	<h3>cash grain dealers reported slow country movement of corn and soybeans across the midwest, with even corn sales from pik-and-roll activity seen earlier this week drying up.     some dealers said the usda may further adjust the posted county price at the gulf to take into account high barge freight rates as a way to keep corn sales flowing, but added the current plan probably will be given a few weeks to see if it will work as hoped.     corn and soybean basis values continued to drop on the illinois and midmississippi river due to the strong barge freight rates. toledo and chicago elevators were finishing loading the first corn boats of the new shipping season, supporting spot basis values at those terminal points.                    corn             soybeans  toledo         5 und may unc   1 und may unc  cincinnati     1 und may unc   1 ovr may up 2  new haven     12 und may unc   2 und may dn 1  n.e. indiana  10 und may unc   2 ovr may dn 1  chicago      1/2 ovr may unc   5 und may unc  seneca       51/2 und may dn 1 7 und may unc  davenport 61/2und may dn61/2 61/2und may dn11/2  clinton        5 und may dn 3       ua  cedar rapids  11 und may dn 3 13 und may dn 2                   hrw wheat  toledo  58 lb 35 ovr may up 1  chicago 57 lb 25 ovr may unc  cincinnati dp 10 ovr may unc  ne indiana dp  8 ovr may unc  pik certificates - 103/104 pct - unc/ dn 2  nc - no comparison  ua - unavailable  unc - unchanged dp - delayed pricing   reuter &#3;</h3>
