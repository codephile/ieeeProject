	<h3>the french parliament has approved a substantial increase in defence spending to modernise the country's nuclear and conventional forces.     the bill provides 474 billion francs for defence expenditure over a five-year period starting next year, with 32 pct allocated to modernise the country's nuclear weapons systems.     the budget represents a six pct annual increase, starting next year, well above the 3.5 pct nato recommends for members of its military command. france is a member of nato but does not belong to its integrated military command.     the budget will help finance three new types of nuclear weapons, a military reconnaissance satellite, a nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the amx leclerc tank and the possible development of chemical weapons.     the program also includes funds for design work on nuclear missile submarines and the m-5 submarine-launched missile.  reuter &#3;</h3>
