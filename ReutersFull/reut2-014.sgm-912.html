	<h3>the bank of japan bought a small amount of dollars shortly after the opening at around 145.30 yen, dealers said.     the central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house sold dollars, putting pressure on the u.s. currency, they said.     the dollar was also supported by a major electrical consumer goods company, which was a speculative dollar buyer at around 145.25 yen, they added.     the dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in new york and 145.25 at the close here yesterday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
