	<h3>finance minister gibson chigaga said all of zambia's traditional financial backers apart from britain had pledged continued backing for the country's new go-it-alone economic program announced last month.     chigaga told reuters in an interview it was not true that western states had threatened to withold financial aid following zambia's abandonement of a tough imf-inspired program that included the auctioning of the local kwacha.     "it is only britain which has openly come out to say it would withhold funds intended for the auction system of foreign exchange," chigaga said.     "all the other countries have said their relationship with us cannot be affected by the abandonment of a system that only lived for 18 months, when they have been supporting us for over 20 years now," he said.     chigaga said that britain was now considering its stand following representation by the zambian government.     chigaga told reuters that guidelines on the functioning of the new economic prgram would be released soon.  reuter &#3;</h3>
