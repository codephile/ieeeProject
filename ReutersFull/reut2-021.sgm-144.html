	<h3>caterpillar inc said it expects 1987 full year sales and profits to be "substantially better" than 1986 results, following improved third-quarter performance.     third-quarter earnings of the heavy machinery manufacturer increased to 146 mln dlrs, or 1.47 dlrs a share, from net loss of 26 mln dlrs, or 26 cts, in the 1986 quarter. sales rose to 2.25 billion dlrs from 1.82 billion dlrs last year.     a weaker u.s. dollar strengthened caterpillar's position against foreign manufacturers and permitted price increases and boosted sales, while a cost-cutting program lowered costs significantly, the company said of third-quarter results.         continuation of the cost-reduction program, which is to pare costs by 15 to 20 pct from 1986 to 1990, and a further anticipated improvement in its price competitiveness are expected to contribute to higher full year 1987 profits, caterpillar said.     in 1986, the company earned 76 mln dlrs or 77 cents a share.  reuter &#3;</h3>
