	<h3>kraft inc said it strongly disagreed with a complaint filed by the federal trade commission that it made false and misleading claims about its kraft singles cheese product and said it would fight the charge.     "kraft has always been committed to informative and truthful advertising and this compaign clearly meets those criteria," kraft said in a prepared statement.     "we believe the integreity of the advertising will be established through the litigation process," kraft said.     company spokesman scott horne said he could not elaborate on the statement because the case is being litigated.     the ftc charged kraft with making false and misleading claims in its advertising by overstating the calcuim content of its kraft singles american pasteurized process cheese food.     in an administrative complaint, the ftc charged the glenview, ill., food and consumer products company with falsely claiming that a slice of kraft singles contains the same amount of calcium as five ounces of milk.     the company also falsely advertised that kraft singles contain more calcium than most slices of imitation cheese and that it could substantiate its claims, the ftc charged.  reuter &#3;</h3>
