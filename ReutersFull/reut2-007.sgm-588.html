	<h3>brazil's hard-line debt stance, though meeting creditor resistance, is boosting political initiatives in latin america aimed at broadening the global strategy, regional debt officials and economic analysts say.     "now more than ever it is clear that latin america cannot pay, under present conditions, without sacrificing growth," peruvian president alan garcia said, referring to brazil.     and, as debtors and creditors prepare for their annual meeting at the inter-american development bank in miami next week, the region's debt crisis is clearly coming to a head.     around 200 billion dlrs in commercial bank debt have been rescheduled since 1983, with interest rate margins now below one pct, multi-year accords a norm and no financial crash in sight, but a lasting solution seems no nearer.     virtually all latin american leaders backed brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of private bank debt last month, though prospects of a chain default are still remote.     mexico, colombia, argentina and others rejected such action and mexican finance minister gustavo petricioli merely said, "brazil is having problems we are sure will be temporary."     but brazil's action has had an impact on other debt negotiations, speeding agreement for chile and venezuela last month and influencing current talks with argentina.     pressure for new solutions has built up on several fronts, with the philippines joining brazil in seeking interest relief and ecuador announcing force majeure on debt payments following a serious earthquake.     private banks are being increasingly urged to renew lending and accept innovative repayment schemes, not only by debtors but also by official agencies which have stepped up their own credit flows as part of the u.s.-inspired plan.     one latin american debt official said he saw the brazil and ecuadorean announcements as spurring moves by other debtors to link debt service payments to macroeconomic indicators such as export earnings, gdp or raw materials prices.     despite this, debtor countries continue to accept the case-by-case approach, and cuba's call for a joint negotiating front is not being promoted by brazil or even defended by peru, the region's flag-bearer in unilateral payment decisions.     "each nation must negotiate its debt independently, according to its own needs," brazilian foreign minister ramiro de abreu sodre said in caracas at the weekend.     venezuela's rapid agreement with its creditors, soon after brazil's move, had been seen by the political opposition as a betrayal of debtor solidarity, but de abreu praised the venezuelan negotiators for achieving a favourable deal.     argentina, bolivia, costa rica and others are also pursuing normal negotiations with creditor banks, while at the same time pressing hard for better terms, particularly lower interest rate spreads. latin american officials say that while the debt should be negotiated case-by-case, their governments are promoting a general framework for talks based on growth and development priorities, lower interest payments and new financing.     "the brazilian and ecuadorean experience shows orthodox solutions to debt cases don't work," said a senior peruvian government official responsible for debt affairs.     he saw a growing likelihood that other countries would follow peru's action in setting a 10 pct debt payment limit in the face of trade and other factors beyond debtors' control such as minimal bank lending.     these factors have contributed to a 130 billion dlr net outflow from latin america in the last five years, and brazilian finance minister dilson funaro says brazil alone paid back 45 billion dlrs in this time and received just 11 billion in loans.     latin american debtors feel they have complied with their side of the bargain, slashing public spending, devaluing currencies, cutting inflation, privatizing state enterprises and introducing debt equity schemes.     brazil, as the region's biggest debtor and its most diversified economy, has now apparently adopted the principle that a tough position with its creditors will avoid a more serious crisis later on.     "we are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis," funaro told a conference in rio de janeiro this week. billion dlr debt burden this year are slim, with coffee prices plunging, oil prices up but still well below 1985 levels and interest rates beginning to rise.  mexico expects one to two pct growth instead of the two to three pct projected earlier, and inflation near 80 pct after 105 pct last year.     brazilian officials expect growth of only two pct after eight pct last year and a 30 pct drop in the projected trade surplus, while independent estimates put inflation at 200 pct.     political and economic analysts in brazil believe the payment suspension will give new impetus to tackling the regional crisis though they expect protracted negotiations, a view echoed by senior international bank officials.     some banks, including citibank, morgan guaranty and bank of america are already preparing to downgrade their brazil loans.     brazil's refusal to accept an imf program, a condition set by many banks for new lending, meanwhile reflects the view of most latin american governments that equate the fund with recession. but brazil and venezuela are the only countries in the region to have rescheduled debt without an imf program.  reuter &#3;</h3>
