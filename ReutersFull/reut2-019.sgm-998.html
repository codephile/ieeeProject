	<h3>canon inc <cann.t> said it will stop making japanese language word processors with retail prices below 50,000 yen and consign production instead to <kyushu matsushita electronic co ltd>, a 51.75-pct owned unit of matsushita electric industrial co ltd <mc.t>.     a canon spokesman said the move reflects intense price competition as canon, casio computer co ltd <cact.t> and others compete in the growing market for low-end processors.     canon will focus production on more expensive and sophisticated models which have more generous profit margins, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
