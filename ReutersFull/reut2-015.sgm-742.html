	<h3>eurodollar bonds closed as much as a full point lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against the yen and interest rates on u.s. treasuries rose almost to eight pct.     the dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightly after foreign exchange traders in new york said the federal reserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.     but despite the dollar's woes, japan development bank, wholly owned by the japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs in a seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.     lead manager for the issue, bank of tokyo, said the deal, at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points over comparable maturity treasuries. however, by the close of trading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide in aftermarket activity.     dealers noted that the spread to treasuries is wide for a newly-priced aaa-rated borrower like japan development bank. for example, earlier this week, the world bank raised u.s. dlrs at only 25 basis points over treasuries. dealers said that because the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the last time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.     but officials at bank of tokyo said the spread is intended to compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty currently associated with owning dollar securities.     the officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in dollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the only market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size. japan development bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.     market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into yen as the borrowers previous issues were.     late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees at less 1.75 less 1.55.     also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from toshiba international finance (netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8 pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.     three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered, the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by sekisui chemical co and guaranteed by sanwa bank ltd. the issue has equity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on brokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.     the australian dollar market continued active, with canadian imperial bank of commerce offering a bond of 125 mln five-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.     late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. a similar deal yesterday by toronto dominion, priced slightly higher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was quoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.     dealers said that investors are apparently willing to accept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less than annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail buyers. also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates fall in australia as many analysts expect, the potential for capital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. the bonds are also better for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.     dealers said that the australia dlr zero coupon bonds are apparently being placed with retail accounts on the european continent with very little placement being done in japan.     euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on domestic japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as the yen soared. after the markets closed, the dollar fell to 144 yen.     the european investment bank (eib) issued a 40 mln euroyen issue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. this is the second seven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curve in japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.  reuter &#3;</h3>
