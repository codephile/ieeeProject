	<h3>treasury secretary james baker said that massive new lending to the debtor nations could actually increase their difficulties in the period ahead without protections.     in testimony before a senate committee, baker said that "throwing money at the debtor nations won't solve their problems."     he said it might seem like an easy solution to the debt problems and might appear a simple way to boost u.s. exports and growth in the debtor nations.     baker told the committee that such an approach could "worsen their difficulties unless the new financing can be productively absorbed and is consistent with their ability to grow and service debt."     he said that the debt initiative that bears his name is a long-term approach and that further progress "will be gradual and will vary among nations, depending upon their own determination to implement growth-oriented reforms and the continued active support of the international community."  reuter &#3;</h3>
