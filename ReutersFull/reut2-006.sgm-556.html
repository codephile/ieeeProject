	<h3>world stocks of silver are large enough to accommodate any changes in the supply-demand equation this year, with industrial consumption expected to again exceed mine production, the dealer house handy and harman said in its annual review of the silver market.     the house estimated that the industry last year withdrew 20,000,000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supply deficit caused by a consumption rate of 403,000,000 ounces and production level of 382,000,000 ounces.     however, world stocks are huge, totaling 2,267,900,000 ounces at the end of 1986, it said.     the review noted that world industrial consumption has been on an uptrend since 1980, although offtake is still 14 pct below the 1978 level of 442,000,000 ounces.     handy and harman said 22,800,000 ounces of silver were used to produce coins last year, up from 12,700,000 ounces in 1985, with the demand getting a big boost from the production of u.s. coins, including the american eagle.     it also said that in recent years communist countries have increased their silver imports and estimated that china and east germany alone took in 70,000,000 ounces of foreign silver in the last five years.  reuter &#3;</h3>
