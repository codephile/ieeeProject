	<h3>dome petroleum ltd's loss of 2.20 billion dlrs, believed to be the biggest ever by a canadian company, will have little impact on daily operations but will pressure creditors to accept a proposal to restructure dome's debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs, industry analysts said.     "essentially what it (dome's loss) does is put more focus on the importance of the restructuring and puts more pressure on creditors to agree to the debt rescheduling," said an oil analyst who asked that he not be identified.     dome reported earnings yesterday.     analysts said the huge loss improves the appeal of a debt accord by underlining company statements that creditors would receive little or nothing under a forced liquidation that could take several years to complete.     after several months of negotiations with a group of 56 major creditors and other unsecured public debt holders, dome submitted a complex proposal earlier this month that includes converting debt to equity and extending repayment time.     "they've had their talks and now they have the proposal, so the banks have to decide whether to accept the restructuring or pull the plug," the analyst said.     he and others said the huge loss, including writedowns totalling 2.08 billion dlrs before a 571 mln dlr reduction in deferred income taxes, dramatically enforces the company's claim that a 50 pct drop in world oil prices has crippled its financial position.     but analysts said the writedown only impacts dome's balance sheet and does not hurt the company's cash position.     "to a large extent, these writeoffs of the carrying value of assets is really just the bookkeepers catching up to what the stock market has been telling us for a long time, reflecting the collapse in oil prices," peters and co ltd analyst wilf gobert said.     dome reported it took a 1.20 billion charge in the fourth quarter, before a 305 mln dlr reduction in deferred income taxes, for the decline in value of dome's oil and gas properties.     the extraordinary loss conformed with new canadian institute of chartered accountants guidelines that require dome to use average 1986 oil prices to value its holdings, instead of an escalating price method used in prior years.     analysts said six individual swiss noteholders, who initiated legal action against dome to recover debt of 408,500 dlrs, will also be pressed to adopt a more lenient stand by the 1986 results.     "to the extent that individuals were not fully accepting or cognizant of the seriousness of dome's financial position, the financial statements reflecting this writedown of the value of assets is certainly going to indicate the depth of the hemorrhaging that has taken place," gobert said.     the legal action now before swiss courts threatens to trigger cross-defaults on all of dome's debt, toppling the delicate debt negotiations. dome is next scheduled to appear april six to defend against the action.     first marathon securities ltd analyst rick hallisey said the size of the loss was slightly larger than industry estimates of dome's negative net worth, ranging between 1.50 billion and two billion dlrs.     "what this writedown says is that a lot of the money that was spent in the past is unrecoverable, but the shareholders have already recognized that through the writedown in the stock price," gobert said, adding, "the financial statements have come out and said that what has happened in the past has been a disaster for dome," gobert added.     the price of dome common shares fell five cts to 1.05 dlrs in trading on the toronto stock exchange today. at the height of dome's success in 1981, common traded at about 25 dlrs a share.  reuter &#3;</h3>
