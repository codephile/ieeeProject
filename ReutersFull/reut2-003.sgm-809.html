	<h3>rlr financial services inc said the national association of securities dealers has decided not to delist its stock from nasdaq on march 12 as it had threatened.     the company said the nasd has granted it an indeterminate amount of time to resolve issues raised by the nasd on the market making of rlr's rlr securities group inc subsidiary in shares of the parent company.     the nasd had alleged that no registration statement for the shares was in effect.  rlr contested the charge but stopped market making in its own stock.  reuter &#3;</h3>
