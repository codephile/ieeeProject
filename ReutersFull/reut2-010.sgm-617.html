	<h3>lebanese central bank vice governor meguerditch bouldikian called for the establishment of an arab fund to assist the lebanese pound, which has lost more than 80 pct of its value against the dollar since january 1986.     bouldikian told an arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency.     but he said lebanon needed foreign support for its war-battered economy now more than ever before. "we expect a common effort between the central bank and arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed," he said.     twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits.     bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in reducing demand for imports and increasing exports. "these are encouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet," he said.     "we believe that with a just political solution acceptable to all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit the lebanese pound and lebanon."     in the meantime, he said the central bank had four main goals:     1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit     2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank financing institutions in financing the deficit     3) to limit the transfer of lebanese pounds into foreign currency deposits     4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks.  reuter &#3;</h3>
