	<h3>standard and poor's corp said it expects the asset-backed securities market to grow dramatically over the next few years, spurred by what it termed the compelling benefits of secured financing.     s and p projected the market would grow to 100 billion dlrs in the next five years. investment bankers say the market currently stands at roughly 11.9 billion dlrs.     assets used to secure the debt included auto loans, credit cars, computer leases and corporate loans, s and p noted. the most active issuers to date had two main motivations, lower costs of funding and increased financial flexibility.     standard and poor's pointed out that general motors corp <gm>, chrysler corp <c> and nissan motor co ltd <nsan> realized funding advantages by issuing car loan backed debt. but more important, these issuers were able to increase loan volume, and hence car sales, without substantially increasing financial leverage, the rating agency said.     s and p noted that bank of america, a unit of bankamerica corp <bac>, and republicbank corp's <rpt> republicbank delaware unit issued credit card backed debt and also realized lower funding costs while mitigating increased funding and liquidity risks resulting from weak financial performance.  reuter &#3;</h3>
