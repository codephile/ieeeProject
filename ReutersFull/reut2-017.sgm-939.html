	<h3>the world bank's policies prevent it from lending money for the transfer of land from landowners to the landless, but it can help finance development of the philippines' proposed land reform program, a bank official said.     "the world bank by its established policies cannot use its resources to finance the transfer of assets from one group to another. our mandate is to finance investment-related activities," rolando arrivillaga, the bank's resident representative in the philippines, told reuters in an interview.     arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by a world bank mission that came in march to review the land reform program and which said the bank would not be able to finance compensation payments for the transfer of land.     he said the philippine government had never asked the bank to finance land transfers, and the bank's position should not be taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program.     "clearly in the case of land reform the question of land transfer by definition is transferring assets from the landed to the landless," arrivillaga said. "however, the bank as an institution can finance the development aspects of the program."     "we will deal with the part of the program that deals with how to put the land to effective use once it has been transferred and how to make the on-farm investments that are needed to attain the goal of improving the income level of the beneficiaries," arrivillaga said.     "i wouldn't be surprised if other multilateral institutions are faced with similar constraints," he said.     president corazon aquino's spokesman said last week that she was committed to launching the program, which limits land holdings to seven hectares, by using her sweeping powers of rule by decree before a new congress convenes in july.     presidential spokesman teodoro benigno said the land reform program, estimated to cost about 44 billion pesos, would be implemented in four phases and benefit 2.64 mln farmers.     benigno said the first two phases would complete the transfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as well as the transfer of land sequestered, expropriated or foreclosed by the government and would cover 1.15 mln hectares.     but aquino would not decree the redistribution of large sugar, banana and coconut plantations, leaving it to the congress to work out the details, benigno said.     arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors, who form part of a consultative group led by the world bank, might be prepared to finance the land transfers.     "i don't think there are fast and easy rules as to how international sources of finance would behave in a situation like this, because land reform by its very nature requires rich financing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitable to both the landowner and the beneficiary," he said.     arrivillaga said the first priority for the government would be to tap domestic sources of financing for the land transfer, but external assistance could be brought in if there were gaps.     "in such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness of the government is how it confronts the domestic resource requirement," arrivillaga said. "multilateral agencies by their very nature are lenders of last resort. it means they have to be convinced that the government prioritises the program."     he said the world bank had financed developmental costs under an earlier land reform program launched by former president ferdinand marcos in 1972, and such aid had been channelled through the land bank of the philippines (lbp).     the lbp is the main implementing agency under aquino's program.     "if asked to do so again and the program is designed to improve the standard of living of the poor then we would certainly be prepared to consider (lending)," arrivillaga said.     he said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate the costs by presenting ten-year perspectives in a one-year context.     arrivillaga said the government could solve most of its financing problems by devising effective instruments to compensate landowners.     finance secretary jaime ongpin has said landowners are likely to be paid 10 pct in cash and the rest in 10-year bonds with 10 pct of their face value redeemable each year.     arrivillaga said any instruments used to compensate landowners had to be freely tradable at near face value and added: "the challenge is to devise a system of deferred payments that is as good as cash."     he said the international financing community was watching the philippine experiment with great interest.     "they are going to be an interesting model for many other countries because they opened a dialogue on the reforms to every sector of the population and even international institutions," he said. "i think they'll be on a very solid base when they make the decision to launch the reforms."  reuter &#3;</h3>
