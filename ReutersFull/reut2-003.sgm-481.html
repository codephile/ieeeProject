	<h3>the bank of england said it forecast a liquidity shortage of around 300 mln stg in the market today.     among the main factors, the bank said bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 483 mln stg from the system while below target bankers' balances and a rise in the note circulation would take out 50 mln and 100 mln stg respectively.     partially offsetting these, exchequer transactions would add around 355 mln stg, the bank added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
