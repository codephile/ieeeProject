	<h3>the u.s. agriculture department said it will update its estimate of winter wheat seeded acreage in the prospective planting report, scheduled for release at 1500 est (2100 gmt) tomorrow, march 31.     the original estimate of seedings of winter wheat was published in january.     it said the new survey is possible because of the new integrated nationwide survey program that uses probability sampling procedures that combine information from farmers operating in selected areas and farmers identified on special lists.  reuter &#3;</h3>
