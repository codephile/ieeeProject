	<h3>there is no confirmation that brazil's major processors of frozen concentrated orange juice, fcoj, will raise export prices of the product to 1,375 dlrs per tonne from april 1, a spokesman for the brazilian association of citrus juice industries (abrassuco) said.     asked to comment on a report from new york that cutrale and citrosuco had sent telexes to customers informing of the price raise, jose carlos goncalves said abrassuco was not aware of it.     "all we know is that cacex has increased the dollar amount to translate fob price to ex-dock new york price to 1,050 dlrs from 770 dlrs," goncalves said.     citrosuco and cutrale officials were not available for comment.  reuter &#3;</h3>
