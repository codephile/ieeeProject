	<h3>total petroleum na <tpn> shut down several small crude oil pipelines operating near the texas/oklahoma border last friday as a precaution against damage from local flooding, according to gary zollinger, manager of operations.     total shut a 12-inch line that runs across the ouachita river from wynnewood to ardmore with a capacity of 62,000 bpd as well as several smaller pipelines a few inches wide with capacities of several thousand bpd or less, zollinger said.     the basin pipeline, a major pipeline running 300,000 bpd, run by a consortium of other oil companies, was closed today.     one other small pipeline that total also closed has a capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the red river in fargo, texas, zollinger said.     he said the closed pipelines run under river water and could be damaged as the flooded rivers erode the river banks and expose the piping.     zollinger said total is waiting for the river waters to recede before they reactivate the pipelines.  reuter &#3;</h3>
