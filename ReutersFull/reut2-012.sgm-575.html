	<h3>bank of spain governor mariano rubio said the central bank was worried that money supply was growing too fast, reflecting excessive internal demand in the spanish economy, but added that he was confident recent measures would succeed in restricting money growth.     in testimony to the economic commission of congress, rubio said the main measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands, grew at an estimated annualised rate of 17 pct in march, the same as in february.     the bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987 is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year.     rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range.     he added that real gdp growth of three pct in 1986 was due to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct real drop in the contribution of the external sector.     the aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in gdp but a drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative component of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
