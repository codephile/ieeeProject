	<h3>house speaker jim wright endorsed a proposal to require the president to take action to reduce oil imports if they threaten to top 50 pct of u.s. consumption.     wright told reporters the plan by sen. lloyd bentsen, a fellow texas democrat, was positive and useful. oil imports peaked in 1977 at 47 pct, were short of 36 pct last year and this year are up over 40 pct, bentsen said.      the bentsen proposal, supported by 24 other senators, would would require the president to issue annual three-year oil import forecasts. in any year they threatened to top 50 pct, he would be ordered to propose quotas or other solution.      reuter &#3;</h3>
