	<h3>an influential member of congress endorsed a general accounting office, gao, proposal calling for establishing a federal board to oversee government assistance to the financially-troubled farm credit system.     rep. ed jones, d-tenn., chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee which will draft a farm credit rescue package later this year, told reporters following testimony by comptroller general charles bowsher, that establishing a federal board to implement the rescue is a good idea.     "i like the idea of an additional layer of management" to oversee the rescue, jones told reporters.     rep. jones made the remarks following a hearing at which the general accounting office, gao, outlined its suggestions for a bail-out of the system.     comptroller general bowsher proposed congress set up a strong board, modeled on the example of the successful chrysler loan guarantee board, to make hard choices on restructuring the failing system.     the members of the board would include both representatives of government agencies and some independent officials, bowsher proposed.  reuter &#3;</h3>
