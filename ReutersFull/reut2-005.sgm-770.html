	<h3>west german president richard von weizsaecker said both debtor and creditor nations share responsibility for the third world's foreign debt crisis.     weizsaecker, in a speech on the first day of an official visit to argentina, said: "debtor and creditor countries have created this situation jointly. they also share responsibility for finding lasting solutions."     local officials have payed great importance to weizsaecker's visit because they consider him a key backer of more flexible repayment terms for argentina's 51 billion dlr foreign debt, latin america's third largest.     weizsaecker, speaking at a reception held for him by president raul alfonsin at buenos aires' city council hall, also said no one could overlook the enormity of the obstacle posed by the foreign debt to countries like argentina.     "democracy in latin america must not be endangered because of misery or new injustices," he said.     argentine officials said they might halt debt payments last month if creditor banks did not agree to a new 2.15 billion dlr loan. an argentine mission is now in the u.s. for talks with 11 banks, seeking to win an easing of repayment terms and secure the loan.     weizsaecker said argentina has had difficulties with the european community over trade barriers and subsidies for grain exports.     "we are making efforts to eliminate them with the help of balanced interest from all parties," he said.     argentina has said the barriers and subsidies cut unfairly into the country's traditional markets for its grain exports.     weizsaecker arrived for a four-day visit, opening a latin american tour which includes bolivia and guatemala. he held brief talks on sunday with brazilian president jose sarney during a stopover in brasilia.  reuter &#3;</h3>
