	<h3>european community (ec) member states have generally given a cool initial reaction to proposals by the european commission for cereal price changes and related measures in the coming season, ec diplomats said.     they said that in meetings of the ec special committee on agriculture representatives of most member states had said the changes, taken together, would have too harsh an impact on farmers' incomes.     only britain and the netherlands had shown willingness to accept the commission's overall package, they said.     as well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for most cereals, the commission proposes a limitation of intervention to the february to march period and reduced monthly increments in intervention prices.     ec farm ministers will have a first discussion of the proposals at a meeting beginning next monday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
