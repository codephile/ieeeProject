	<h3>u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng does not intend to discuss a wheat export enhancement initiative to the soviet union at a cabinet-level economic policy council meeting set for tomorrow, an aide to lyng said.     "he (lyng) does not intend to bring it up," the aide said, adding that the subsidy offer remains "dormant."     lyng plans to spend "about five minutes" reviewing the status of farm legislation on capitol hill before the economic policy council, which is responsible for guiding the administration's economic policy, the aide said.     the usda secretary met this morning with members of the house foreign affairs committee, but the handful of lawmakers present did not ask whether the administration intended to offer moscow a wheat export bonus, the aide said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
