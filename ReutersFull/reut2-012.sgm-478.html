	<h3>turnover on the amsterdam bourse rose 38 pct in march to 25.8 billion guilders from 18.7 billion in february compared with 27.6 billion in march last year, the bourse said in its monthly review.     sentiment improved last month after a weak performance in january and lacklustre trading in february, helped by good corporate results and falling interest rates, the bourse said.     however, sentiment was dampened by reports of declining exports, a drop in trade with west germany, a slower world economic growth rate and trade tensions.     share turnover was up 5.1 billion guilders last month at 14.4 billion from 9.3 billion in february.     bond turnover rose to 11.4 billion guilders in march from 9.4 billion in february.     on the second tier parallel market, march turnover rose 62 pct to 267 mln guilders from 165 mln in february.  reuter &#3;</h3>
