	<h3>the securities and exchange commission said it supported legislation to define insider trading and would recommend language for such a definition within six weeks.     acting sec chairman charles cox told the senate banking committee a bill proposed this week to define insider trading as the wrongful use of material nonpublic information was good but contained some ambiguous provisions which might reduce the commission's flexibility in prosecuting cases.     "the commission believes a definition of insider trading is desirable," cox said.         he promised to provide the sec's recommended definition to the committee by august 3.     the bill proposed by sens. donald riegle, a michigan democrat, and alfonse d'amato, a new york republican, would make it illegal for anyone to receive or pass on inside information even if the person providing the information did not use it to make a securities transaction.     federal law enforcement officials have said a definition of insider trading would be useful because it is a difficult crime to prove.         cox said the sec was having success in its insider trading cases despite the lack of a clear definition.     he became acting chairman of the agency when chairman john shad left to become u.s. ambassador to the netherlands.     president reagan nominated northwestern university law professor david ruder as sec chairman on wednesday, but he may not be confirmed by the senate for several weeks.         riegle, the chairman of the senate securities subcommittee, said he wanted to act on the legislation this year, but thomas moore, a member of the president's council of economic advisors, said action should be delayed until the supreme court ruled on the appearl of an insider trading conviction by former wall street journal reporter r. foster winans.     winans was convicted for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. the stocks usually went up or down in price depending on winans' recommendation.         "we believe it would be better to wait until the supreme court has reviewed the winans case before any leigilation is considered. after the court decides this case we can better consider how the law might be changed. until that time, legislation is premature," moore said in his testimony.  reuter &#3;</h3>
