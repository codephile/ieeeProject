	<h3>japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa said the strengthening of the yen against the dollar that has occurred since the paris agreement was within the range agreed on in the louvre discussions.     "i would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in paris," miyazawa told a press conference following the group of seven meeting here.     he added that the current discussions were a "reaffirmation" of that agreement, indicating that the "solidarity" that occurred in paris was still in place.  reuter &#3;</h3>
