	<h3>a team of california researchers said that they have developed a better, faster test for detecting sickle cell anemia in unborn children than existing procedures.      the test, developed by cetus corp <ctus> researchers, requires only a small amount of genetic material from a fetus and produces a diagnosis within a day, unlike other tests that require several days and can only be done in a few specialized centers, they said.      sickle cell anemia is a painful, inherited blood disease that causes the normally-flexible red blood cells to stiffen into a sickle-like shape. it is primarily found in blacks.     the researchers said in the new england journal of medicine that their "procedure promises to be a rapid, sensitive and reliable method for the prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell disease."      in addition, they said, the technique might also be adapted to detect other types of genetic disease.  reuter &#3;</h3>
