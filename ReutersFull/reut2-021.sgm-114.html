	<h3>yugoslav prime minister branko mikulic, unveiling a new draft economic program, said yugoslavia would cut repayments on its almost 20 billion lr hard currency debt to bring them in line with its hard currency earning capacity.     "we have decided to coordinate repayment of our debt with realistically assessed capabilities of our economy," he said in parliament. he said the current debt-service ratio (over 40 pct of export revenue) was too high.     yugoslavia is to negotiate a long-term restructuring of its debt after missing repayments in recent months, mikulic said.     "if we did not change the dynamics of repaying our debt, the situation would become increasingly worse," mikulic said.     he said on the present repayment schedule, yugoslavia would have a net outflow of two billion dlrs and the level of debt would be halved by 1995. but he added:     "the consequences would not only mean slower economic growth in the coming years but also further exhaustion of the economy and lasting damage to the economy's capacity for development," he said.     "all that would, of course, intensify social difficulties," mikulic added.     the state news agency tanjug said on october 9 that yugoslavia plans to adjust debt repayments over the next eight years and to cut the debt-service ratio to 25 pct.     yugoslavia failed to make a principal repayment due last month which had already been postponed by 90 days.     mikulic's proposed economic program, which also includes higher personal taxes as well as wage and price restraint, is intended to serve as a basis for the debt talks to demonstrate yugoslavia's ability to eventually repay the credits.     his program has to be discussed and approved by parliament by early november.     mikulic said foreign debt should be retained at about the same level as now until 1990 and the country should then be able to keep currency reserves equal to three months payments.     "of course, these are our proposals for talks with creditors. we expect understanding and support because it is in their interest as well," mikulic said.     he said that under the present schedule debt payments had slowed economic development and exhausted currency reserves. banking sources say yugoslavia's reserves are inadequate at present for even one month's debt and import bill.  reuter &#3;</h3>
