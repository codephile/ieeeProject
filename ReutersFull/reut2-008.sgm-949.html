	<h3>about 14,000 of brazil's 40,000 seamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shipping companies but the rest are still on strike, a spokesman at strike headquarters said today.     the seamen began a national stoppage on february 27.     the spokesman, talking by telephone from rio de janeiro, said 126 ships were strike-bound.     he added that because of resignations by many seamen there were scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships.     the seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pct with the 21 companies. talks with the shipowners' association syndarma have been deadlocked over overtime.     while exports have been delayed by the strike, exporters say the problems have been manageable.     "it hasn't been critical by any means," said a coffee trader in santos, who noted that coffee was still moving on foreign ships.     economic analysts added, however, that any delay to exports served to aggravate brazil's balance of payments crisis, which last month prompted the government to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.  reuter &#3;</h3>
