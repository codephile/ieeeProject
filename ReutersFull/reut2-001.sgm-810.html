	<h3>u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter said he hoped the u.s. dollar would continue to decline in relation to the currencies of taiwan and south korea as a way to improve the u.s. trade picture.     testifying before the house appropriations subcommittee which must approve his agency's 1988 budget, he said, "in my judgment economic factors justify a continued decline."     asked by a committee member if he expected a further decline, and how much, yeutter said the taiwan and south korean currencies should be adjusted to reflect "positive factors" in their economies.  reuter &#3;</h3>
