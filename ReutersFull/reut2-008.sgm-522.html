	<h3>canada's minister of state for finance, tom hockin, said substantial progress was made today with his provincial counterparts on deregulation of the country's financial system, but stumbling blocks remain.     "we were able to make considerable headway," hockin told reporters following a six-hour meeting with provincial ministers responsible for financial institutions.     hockin said he was optimistic an agreement could be reached by the june 30 deadline to bring the sweeping new system in place, but he was willing to extend it if necessary.     under the proposed system the traditional barriers separating the banking, securities and life insurance sectors will be removed and, for the first time, cross ownership will be allowed.     but a jurisdictional dispute over who regulates the new institutions has broken out between the provinces and ottawa. the provinces have traditionally had authority over securities while ottawa held sway over banking.     hockin, without giving details, said under the new system the regulatory system would have to be harmonized to "insure orderly and efficient markets."     hockin said he made it clear to the provinces that ottawa has jurisdiction in any international accords in the financial sector and would not allow any intrusion by the provinces in that area.     hockin said the ministers did not have time to go into detail on all the issues and the talks would continue the rest of this week at the official level.                    reuter &#3;</h3>
