	<h3>brazil will not announce any changes to its coffee export policy, brazilian coffee institute (ibc) president jorio dauster said.     he told reuters brazil was not planning to modify the position it held before the recent international coffee organisation meeting.     earlier this month, talks in london to set new ico export quotas failed.     commenting on the outcome of a coffee producers' meeting in managua last weekend, dauster said that they discussed nothing involving the market.     "in the meeting we agreed to work on behalf of the union of the producers in matters related to an international agreement," dauster said.     the managua meeting was attended by representatives from brazil, mexico, guatemala, el salvador, honduras, costa rica, nicaragua and panama, the latter represented at the meeting merely as an observer.  reuter &#3;</h3>
