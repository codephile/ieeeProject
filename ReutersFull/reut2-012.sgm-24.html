	<h3>toshiba corp <tsba.t>, the japanese electronics group which plans to enter britain's liberalised telecommunications equipment market, risks becoming the first casualty in the current war of words over trade between japan and the u.k., government and industry sources said.     u.k. authorities have lost patience with japanese trading practices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate without unleashing a damaging trade war. "toshiba's timing seems most unfortunate for the company, as it comes exactly when we are looking for someone to punch," one official told reuters.     earlier, <toshiba information systems (u.k.) ltd> said it wanted to enter the british business facsimile and key telephone market. a facsimile machine sends printed data over telephone lines, while a key telephone system is used for switching calls within a business, industry sources said.     the move by toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute over japan's refusal to open up its telecommunications market to foreign companies. "toshiba's timing is most extraordinary," one official at the department of trade and industry (dti) said.     tomorrow, the u.k. government will consider what legal action it can possible take to press for japanese reform.     prime minister margaret thatcher has given notice that the u.k. would fight the japanese government's attempt to prevent cable and wireless plc <cawl.l> from taking a significant position in a new japanese international telecommunications venture. "we regard this as a test case," she told parliament.     but while the u.k. is keen to see some movement on the issue by japan, it is also worried that recent anti-japanese rhetoric may cause developments to get out of hand, officials said.     japanese officials in tokyo today reiterated that japan had no plans to bow to u.k. and u.s. pressure to give foreign telecommunications firms a bigger role there.     the government, for which competition and the deregulation of markets are major political themes, is unlikely to make final decisions tomorrow on how to act against japan, officials said.     detailed consideration of the issue has been shelved during thatcher's official visit to the soviet union, which ends today.     "we are waiting for the prime minister to decide what to do. the dti will pass the ball to her as soon as she returns tonight," a dti official said.     he said toshiba's application would be considered by the office of telecommunications (oftel). an oftel spokeswoman said "a decision on this application will take weeks, maybe months."     asked whether toshiba's bid would fall victim to british retaliation, the oftel spokeswoman said: "who knows what's going to happen given the current situation!"     a toshiba executive, who asked not to be named, told reuters: "we do not anticipate any special problems."     some analysts queried by reuters questioned the basis of britain's strong stand on the cable and wireless bid. one said that the company's proposal was equivalent to a japanese company wanting to take a stake in mercury international, the subsidiary of cable and wireless that is the only real competitor of british telecommunications plc <bty.l>.     british corporate affairs minister michael howard leaves for japan on saturday.     the minister will seek a clear timetable from japan for easier access for british institutions to japanese financial markets, reciprocating the easy access japanese securities houses and banks have to the city of london.     britain has threatened to use its new financial services act to revoke or deny licences to japanese brokerage houses if it does not get satisfaction.     but british authorities would be far from happy if forced to use that weapon, government sources said.     sir nicholas goodison, chairman of the london stock exchange, said in new york yesterday that sanctions against japanese financial institutions operating in the u.k. would set back london's ambition to become a leading centre for corporate financing and securities trading.     chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson also warned yesterday of the negative effects that a trade war could have on the british economy. such a development could hit u.k. exports and sharply alter the outlook for the next general election in which economic recovery will be one of the government's main themes, political analysts said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
