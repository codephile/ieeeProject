	<h3>alcan aluminium ltd said it joined with carrozzeria bertone s.p.a. to exhibit alcan's technology in aluminum structured vehicles at geneva's international auto salon.     alcan said it and bertone have built several bertone x1/9 sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet aluminum. it said the bodies were made on presses used for bertone's steel-structured sports cars.     alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in britain by the motor industry research association.      alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto making methods and plants.     alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. it said the structures also provide long life without the need for rust protection.     the structure provides the same stiffness and safety as present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65 pct reduction in spot welds, alcan said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
