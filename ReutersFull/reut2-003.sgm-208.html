	<h3>holiday corp said its holiday inn hotel group will soon introduce a chain of limited-service hotels in international markets.     the company said the chain, which will be launched initially in western europe, will usually feature 60 to 150 guest rooms and a small restuarant/lounge area, but will offer fewer services and amenities than typical holiday inn hotels.     it said the new hotels will cater to commercial travelers in smaller cities and suburbs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
