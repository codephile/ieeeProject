	<h3>chicago pacific corp said it received about 40 mln dlrs in cash from a surplus in the pension fund of hoover plc, its u.k. subsidiary.     as part of an agreement to refund the amount to the company, hoover employee and pensioner benefits have been significantly enhanced, the company's annual report shows.     in addition, chicago pacific said the remaining 110 mln dlrs surplus funds will be kept in the hoover pension fund and will be invested so that the proceeds will eliminate or reduce required future pension contributions for hoover and its employees as of december 31, 1986, it said.     the 110 mln dlrs remaining surplus is reported as a "restricted long-term investment" under current purchase accounting requirements, according to the report.     the settlement assures employees that their retirement benefits will be adequately funded and provides for future funding from the income received on this investment, it said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
