	<h3>south korea is considering providing special loans and tax benefits to ailing construction firms on condition they stop competing with each other for overseas contracts, government officials said.     they told reuters, in order to benefit under the plan companies would be obliged to give up their licences to bid for foreign projects.     sources at the construction ministry said the ministry plans to slash the number of building firms operating overseas to between 20 and 25, from the current 41.     the construction ministry sources said the construction industry had begun to adapt to drastically reduced orders from the middle east.     they said the government wanted to prevent further hardship by reducing competion between south korean firms. already this year 15 firms had relinquished their licences.     other government officials said new foreign construction orders fell to 2.3 billion dlrs last year, from 4.6 billion in 1985. about 30,000 building workers were laid off in 1986, one third of the total force.     no further details of the proposed plan were available.  reuter &#3;</h3>
