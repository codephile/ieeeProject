	<h3>nv philips gloeilampenfabrieken <pglo.as> said it had agreed with matsushita electric industrial co ltd <mc.t> and nippon gakki co ltd <ngak.t> of japan to jointly produce the components of the newly developed laser audio-video player.     philips last month announced it and sony corp <sne.t> had developed a world standard for the new combi-player.     the player will be able to take the three sizes of new compact disk videos (cdv), which give near perfect sound and image production, as well as the traditional audio laser discs.     yamaha will develop the laser technology, matsushita the video specifications and philips will work on rendering the player compatible with existing european 50-hertz television standards, philips spokeswoman marijke van hooren said.     each company will assemble and market the product under its own label, and it is hoped other hardware companies will join in the marketing of the new product, she said.     she said there were around 160 companies which hold licences for the manufacture of cd players.  reuter &#3;</h3>
