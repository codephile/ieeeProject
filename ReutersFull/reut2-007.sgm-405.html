	<h3>this weekend's meeting of latin american coffee producers here will call for the international coffee organisation (ico) to start talks aimed at firming prices, nicaraguan foreign trade minister alejandro martinez cuenca said.     he said those countries which had confirmed their presence were brazil, mexico, guatemala, el salvador, costa rica and panama. colombia had been invited but he did not know if it would attend.     martinez cuenca told reporters central america alone had lost some 700 mln dlrs through the weakness of world coffee prices, partially caused by lack of an ico quota agreement.  reuter &#3;</h3>
