	<h3>the easing of rules governing overseas use of the yen has caused an explosion of euroyen bond activity but has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency, bond managers and traders said.     although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in the eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keeping the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the japanese, they said. this lack of real yen demand through the freer euroyen market is undermining the 1984 u.s. and japanese accord to internationalise the yen, they said.     the borrowers want to take advantage of low japanese interest rates but have no need for yen. they arrange primarily with japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other currencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. more than 85 pct of euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added.     "the borrowers don't care which currency they use. they are only after attractive money," one bond trader said.     issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous year, boosting euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the total eurobond market, koichi kimura, managing director of daiwa securities co ltd, said recently.     traders said some of the activity stems from battles among japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the prestige of placing a larger share of issues. many even resort to "harakiri" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing.     but the fever continues and the number of offerings could double again in 1987, said naoki yokoyama, manager of nikko securities co ltd's international capital markets operation.     the euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up by japanese trust banks, one trader said. after a 90 day waiting period the bonds flow back to japan where investor appetite is strong, he added.     foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency investments, traders said.     "even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing (in yen)," said masaki shimazu, manager of daiwa's bond department.     while few foreigners are interested in the secondary market, japanese commercial banks, regional banks, life insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the bonds and await their flow back to japan since they offer little currency risk, traders said.     the finance ministry last april shortened the waiting period before issues could flow back to japan to 90 days from 180. a ministry official said it verified through sampling that reflow was fairly small.     "we believe the euroyen bond should remain mainly in the euroyen market," he said.     one trader said that although demand from japanese investors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. he said many investors plan to sell their bonds if japanese or u.s. interest rates decline further.     to encourage further international use of the yen, the ministry is considering allowing the issue of euroyen commercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying demand from potential borrowers.     securities company sources believe the ministry will permit non-residents to issue euroyen commercial paper within the next few months. but they expect it to continue to ban domestic participation in the market for some time to come. japanese banks object to the short-term paper market which they see encroaching on their business territory.     traders said euroyen commercial paper could spur more demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift into shorter-term securities if need be.     "commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps," one bond manager said. if more financial instruments were available, there might be more trades in yen, he added.     euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if they had shorter maturities, traders said.     the ministry is expected to allow four-year euroyen bond maturities within a few months.     one yen bond manager said japanese financial authorities are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules governing international transactions of the yen. but freer use of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the japanese currency, he said. "if exporters or importers can raise funds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the japanese yen as a settlement currency," he added.     the finance ministry official said the government must constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of borrowers and investors. "no major market can keep its status without change," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
