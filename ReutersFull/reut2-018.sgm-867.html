	<h3>canada post said it presented its striking letter carriers with a new contract offer but both sides said there was little indication the offer would end the strike.     the crown agency said it is being held back by government restraint policies and has little move to manoeuvre while while the union said it expected the post office to demand the same contract concessions it has already rejected.     the rotating walkouts spread today to the four atlantic provinces and other parts of quebec while employees in montreal and calgary returned to work.  reuter &#3;</h3>
