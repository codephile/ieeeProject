	<h3>dart group corp <darta>, which wants to acquire supermarkets general corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, is not likely to give up without a fight if its target seeks another buyer, arbitrageurs said.     speculation that dart's offer of 41.75 dlrs per share could be just the beginning of a bidding contest helped supermarkets shares gain one to 42-1/8  on 2.3 mln shares.     one rumor had federated department stores inc <fds> taking a look at supermarkets general. "our policy is that we do not comment on any rumors or speculation of this nature," a federated spokeswoman said.     an arbitrageur noted that dart, controlled by chairman herbert h. haft and his son robert, last year raised its initial bid for safeway stores by approximately 10 pct when safeway resisted.     however, that company was later sold to a buyout group that topped the hafts.     if history repeats itself, the hafts could raise their bid to 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by supermarkets general, the arbitrageur said. but another arbitrageur said the hafts' present bid seemed "quite fair." he said the offer amounts to 10 times after-tax-cash flow which is "probably fully priced."  reuter &#3;</h3>
