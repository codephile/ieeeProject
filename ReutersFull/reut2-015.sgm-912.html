	<h3>sony corp <sne.t> chairman akio morita said sony's profits would be sharply down in 1987 as a result of the dollar's decline.     sony corp posted net consolidated income of 41.89 billion yen (290 million dollars) in 1986, 42.6 pct down on 1985's 73.02 billion yen (506 million dollars).     but morita added that japan would benefit from the strong yen by saving on its energy import bill and he expected profits to recover from 1988 onwards.     he was speaking to reporters at a sony factory opening here.  reuter &#3;</h3>
