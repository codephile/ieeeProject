	<h3>chad's military high command said today troops killed 1,269 libyan soldiers in routing a 5,000-strong force to capture tripoli's major air base in northern chad on sunday.     in its first published casualty list from the fierce battle for ouadi doum air base, the high command said 438 libyans were taken prisoner, while 29 chadian soldiers were killed and 58 wounded.     it said the prisoners included the regional commander, colonel khalifa abul-gassim hastar, while his deputy, colonel gassim ali abu-nawar, was among the dead.     the chadian army also captured substantial amounts of weaponry, including 11 czechoslovak-made l-39 bombers, three soviet mi-24 fighter helicopters and a large number of tanks, as well as hundreds of other vehicles armed with guns or anti-aircraft missiles.     following sunday's battle, french officers said the fall of ouadi doum deprived libya of its only hard runway air base in chad. its main strongpoint, faya largeau some 230 km (150 miles) north of the so-called "red line" along the 16th parallel, was left increasingly exposed.     the 16th parallel divides the central african country into government-held zones in the south and mainly libyan-controlled areas in the north.  reuter &#3;</h3>
