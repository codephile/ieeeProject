	<h3>cyclops corp said the three members of its board appointed last week by <dixons group plc> had resigned and that it named three cyclops executives to replace them.     cyclops said the moves followed the announcement earlier today by dixons that it received only 20 pct of cyclops outstanding common stock under an extended tender offer that expired yesterday.     dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer on march 17 after receiving 54 pct of cyclops shares.     however, the securities and exchange commission last friday pressed dixons to reopen the offer because the u.k.-based company had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of cyclops stock be tendered by the close of the offer.     dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earlier today indicated that a substantial number of tendered cyclops shares had been withdrawn, leaving it with only 852,000 shares, or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln cyclops shares outstanding.     dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares, which, when combined with the shares it already holds, gives it a 21.7 pct stake in cyclops.     cyclops said its reconstituted board includes the three newly named directors and five outside directors, all of whom were on the board prior to dixons tender offer.     the three cyclops directors were replaced by dixons appointees on march 17 under an agreement reached between the two companies.  reuter &#3;</h3>
