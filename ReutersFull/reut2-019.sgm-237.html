	<h3>dutch salvage firm smit-tak said it may take some three weeks to lift the swiss tug orinoko and its lighter pavo which sank 10 days ago at karlsruhe in west germany, blocking the rhine river.     smit-tak, which with its west german subsidiary harms bergung gmbh was commissioned by the local water authorities to raise the vessels, said its lifting fleet was in position and divers had made the first inspection.     smit is still preparing its final salvage plan and said the work would begin on sunday.  reuter &#3;</h3>
