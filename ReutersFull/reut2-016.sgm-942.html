	<h3>japan's policy of self-sufficiency in rice is an example of extreme protectionism, visiting u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng told a press conference.     he told the national press club of japan that because japan had a large export balance, not just with the u.s. but with other countries, it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pct self-sufficient in one product.     speaking after farm trade talks with japan agriculture minister mutsuki kato, lyng said the u.s. had not asked for total liberalisation of the rice market in japan.     lyng urged japan to allow some imports of rice.     "we want to have some access in the rice market," he said.     he said both he and trade representative clayton yeutter were disappointed at the outcome of talks with japan. he told reporters japan had rejected the u.s. proposal to open negotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at the general agreement on tariffs and trade.     lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with japan on rice.     kato has said japan cannot negotiate on its policy of rice self-sufficiency.     asked what the next u.s. step would be on the rice issue, lyng said he did not know what yeutter or the u.s. rice industry would do.     yeutter has promised to consider again in july or august this year a complaint against japan's rice import ban by the u.s. rice millers association if no breakthrough is made in the meantime.     u.s. rice industry officials have indicated they would consider filing another complaint against the japan rice import ban.  reuter &#3;</h3>
