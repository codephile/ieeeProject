	<h3>iran announced tonight that its major offensive against iraq in the gulf war had ended after dealing savage blows against the baghdad government.     the iranian news agency irna, in a report received in london, said the operation code-named karbala-5 launched into iraq on january 9 was now over.     it quoted a joint statewment by the iranian army and revolutionary guards corps as saying that their forces had "dealt one of the severest blows on the iraqi war machine in the history of the iraq-imposed war."     the statement by the iranian high command appeared to herald the close of an assault on the port city of basra in southern iraq.     "the operation was launched at a time when the baghdad government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance power of its army...," said the statement quoted by irna.     it claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive and called on supporters of baghdad to "come to their senses" and discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in iraq.     iran said its forces had "liberated" 155 square kilometers of enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken over islands, townships, rivers and part of a road leading into basra.     the iranian forces "are in full control of these areas," the statement said.     it said 81 iraqi brigades and battalions were totally destroyed, along with 700 tanks and 1,500 other vehicles. the victory list also included 80 warplanes downed, 250 anti- aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers.  reuter &#3;</h3>
