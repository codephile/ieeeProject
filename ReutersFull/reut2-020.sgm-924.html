	<h3>u.s. treasury secretary james baker met west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg and bundesbank president karl otto poehl today in west germany and agreed to support the louvre pact, the treasury department said.     the treasury described the meeting as "a very positive, private meeting in frankfurt, west germany which had been agreed upon last week. "the parties agreed to continue economic cooperation under the louvre agreement and its flexible application including cooperation on exchange rate stability and monetary policies," the treasury said.     the treasury said baker and stoltenberg "are consulting with their g-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels."     the louvre pact is an agreement between the group of seven leading industrial countries including the united states and west germany to promote currency stability.     baker was scheduled to visit scandinavia and belgium this week and the department earlier refused to release details of his travel itinerary, citing security considerations.  reuter &#3;</h3>
