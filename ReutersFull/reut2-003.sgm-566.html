	<h3>foreign minister tadashi kuranari has cancelled a trip tomorrow to the u.s. because of continued confusion in the japanese parliament, foreign ministry officials said.     the cancellation comes just as the u.s. congress is to consider legislation aimed at cutting america's mammoth trade deficit, much of which is with japan.     kuranari has to attend the budget debates the ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) have been forced to resume, after the opposition accused it of trying to railroad the bill through parliament.  reuter &#3;</h3>
