	<h3>shanghai plans to rely on soft loans to finance a number of large-scale projects in the city including an underground railway system, mayor jiang zemin said.     jiang told reuters general manager michael nelson that he hoped work on the railway system to ease shanghai's transport problems would start within two years.     other projects in this city of 12 mln people include a bridge and an extra tunnel under the huangpu river, a new airport and passenger ship terminals and china's biggest railway station, due to open at the end of this year.     the mayor said foreign companies would be invited to participate in some projects through international tendering.     but he added that firms hoping to take part would have to come up with package deals involving soft loan financing.     "this is a complex issue. the conditions relating to tendering will have to be associated with conditions for receiving soft loans," he said.     he said the city was willing to use commercial loans to finance technological improvements to factories which could show a quick return in increased exports and foreign exchange earnings.     "but infrastructure projects take much longer and involve much bigger investments, and with them, the ideal way is to use soft loans," he said.     the mayor added that british, french and japanese firms had already contacted the shanghai authorities with proposals on the underground railway project.     western business sources in shanghai said the project, involving the construction of 14 km of tunnelled track, had been discussed for over 20 years, adding it was expected to cost at least 750 mln dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
