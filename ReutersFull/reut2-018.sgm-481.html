	<h3>japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended march 31 from 25.23 mln a year earlier, the agriculture ministry said.     the marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef cattle raising, ministry officials said.     compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87 against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-march stocks were 217,554 tonnes against 224,101.     corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.     the officials said corn imports rose because the world surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced chicago prices. the corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in 1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.     sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from 18.9 pct because of greater corn use. higher import prices due to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.     soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.     the drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.     rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against 528,152 a year earlier. the compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct from 2.1 pct.  reuter &#3;</h3>
