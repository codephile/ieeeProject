	<h3>budget director james miller said president reagan will not compromise on his vow not to raise taxes despite pressure from congress.     "no, the president has been very clear about that," miller said on nbc's "today" program. "the president's not going to give in."     when asked if reagan's pledge not to raise tax rates meant he might go along with some tax increase not affecting rates, miller replied, "no, i wouldn't read anything into the word tax rate. of course that's the most important thing. but the president's not going to go along with a tax increase."  reuter &#3;</h3>
