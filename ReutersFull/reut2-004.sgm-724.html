	<h3>the european airbus industrie consortium has obtained a total of 104 commitments from nine customers for its planned a340 long-range jet and a330 twin-engined medium-range jet, the consortium said in a communique here.     its supervisory board, meeting in toulouse, "concluded that the commercial and industrial objectives ... have been fulfilled and that a strong basis for a commercially successful programme has been established," the communique said.     but the consortium still has to obtain funding guarantees from its member governments for the 2.5 billion dlr programme.     the nine committed customers are well above the five airlines that the consortium said it needed to launch the plane project.     "therefore the supervisory board has decided to take all necessary steps for a formal launch decision by mid-april 1987 to ensure first deliveries of the a340 in may 1992, to be followed by first deliveries of the a330 a year later," it said.     airbus is a four-nation consortium grouping britain, france, west germany and spain.  reuter &#3;</h3>
