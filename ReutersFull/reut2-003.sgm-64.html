	<h3>the 24 nations of the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the economist intelligence unit (eiu ) said.     the eiu said in its world trade forecast it revised oecd economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in december.     it said the new areas of weakness are west germany and the smaller european countries it influences, and japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year.     the independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for west germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in december and to 2.3 pct from three pct for japan.     it said it expected the oecd to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.     it said the u.s. current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.     it said it expected west germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.     the eiu said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to opec output policy becomes increasingly ragged.     it said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop.     the average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.     "this is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing," the eiu said.     "talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the february meeting (of finance ministers of the group of five and canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in west germany and japan, or a tighter u.s. fiscal policy," it said.     it said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of japanese institutions to buy u.s. government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.     "thus far they have been willing," the eic said, adding that if japan was deterred from buying u.s. bonds the dollar would collapse.     to contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a third world debt crisis, it said.     on trade, the eiu said prospects for 1987 look "increasingly sick."     import growth, forecast in december at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said.     the weakness of the west german economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in december, the eiu said.     on the export side, it said it saw weak demand in west germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in europe, while japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by u.s. exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar.     it said in most of europe and in japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.     however, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current oecd average of three pct. non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984, the eiu said.     after a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.     it said oecd industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.  reuter &#3;</h3>
