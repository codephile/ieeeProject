	<h3>japan air lines ordered checks on its fleet of boeing co. <ba> 747-sr jumbo jets after a major defect was found in one of them last month, an airline spokesman said.     inspectors running a routine check found that one of three diagonal braces attaching an engine to the wing had snapped due to metal fatigue, he said.     he described the defect as "major" but said it was the first time such a fault had been found in the jal fleet.     he said the part was sent to boeing for examination but nothing had been heard from them yet. a boeing spokesman was not immediately available for comment.     jal's entire fleet of eleven 747-srs had been inspected but no similar defect was found, the airline spokesman said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
