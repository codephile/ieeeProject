	<h3>the house committee on energy and commerce is studying recommendations for stricter penalties for violation of securities laws, said rep. john d. dingell, d- mich., chairman of the committee.     dingell told reuters after a speech to businessmen here that insider trading laws must be strengthened to assure that self-regulation by the securities industry is more effective.     "we've got to see to it that (exchange) members regulate their employees," he said.     dingell said his committee is "looking at a number of possibilities" to harshen penalties for violation of securities laws. but he would not be more specific, saying proposals on stiffer penalties are still being drafted in washington.     "i wish i could be more definitive, but i can't," dingell told reuters.     dingell said another solution to the problem of insider trading would be a "significant" increase in funding for the securities and exchange commission, as well as in sec's authority to enforce securities laws.     dingell added that he supports self-regulation by the securities industry rather than government creation of "some new structure that may or may not work."     "the markets must regulate themselves," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
