	<h3>the dollar drifted down to end one pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the lack of concrete news from the group of seven meeting and comments on the edge of the washington imf/world bank meeting.     dealers said the communique early in the european morning from the g-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further attempts to push it lower through the day.     the u.s. currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below yesterday's last 1.8365/75.     koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated adherence to international agreements such as those set at the plaza hotel in 1985 and in paris on february 22.     koch described the wording of the communique from the g-7 as "soft as wax."     bundebank vice-president helmut schlesinger told reuters in a telephone interview that the german central bank sees no current reason to change monetary course at present.     schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by bundesbank board member claus koehler and west berlin state central bank president dieter hiss, which dealers said revived some speculation that german interest rate cuts may be under consideration.     german call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70 pct after 3.80 yesterday.     some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added via bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next week. hopes of a cut were dashed on tuesday with an allocation at an unchanged 3.80 pct.     but speaking of the pact tender rate next week, schlesinger said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."     euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around 3-7/8 pct. eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional 1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.     sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965 last night. the swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to 1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.     ems currencies saw the french franc end unchanged from last night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the belgian franc easing however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.  reuter &#3;</h3>
