	<h3>treasury secretary james baker said that the current expansion, which he noted was in its fifth year, will continue in the period ahead.     he told the house appropriations committee that "there is every prospect that the current expansion will continue unabated through 1987 and the years beyond."     baker said interest rates over the period have continued to decline and that "policies of the federal reserve assure that ample credit was available.     he said that the administration's longer term forecast envisioned that "we will maintain and improve upon our progress in bringing down the rate of inflation."  reuter &#3;</h3>
