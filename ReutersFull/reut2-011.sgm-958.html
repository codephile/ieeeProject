	<h3>senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy (d-vt.) charged japan with lying and cheating in its trade practices.      "the japanese, not to put too fine a point on it, have lied, cheated and otherwise misused tariff legislation, theirs and ours. and that's to give them the benefit of the doubt," leahy said.      the senator's remarks to the national cattlemen's association provoked laughter, followed by applause.      leahy said the reagan administration's plan to raise tariffs on a variety of japanese imports in retaliation against tokyo's violation of a bilateral semiconducter pact was "long overdue."  reuter &#3;</h3>
