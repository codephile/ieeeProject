	<h3>britain's centrist alliance has gained further ground and now stands second to the ruling conservatives according to a new public opinion poll, leaving the main opposition labour party trailing in third place.     the gallup survey to be published in tomorrow's daily telegraph newspaper shows the conservatives with a popularity rating of 37.5 pct, followed by the social democrat/liberal alliance with 31.5 pct and labour with 29.5 pct.     a marplan poll published in this morning's edition of the today newspaper gave the conservatives 36 pct against a tied figure of 31 pct each for labour and the alliance.     last month a marplan poll gave the tories 38 pct, the alliance 21 pct and labour 37 pct.     the latest poll findings would, if translated into an election result, produce a hung parliament where no single party enjoyed an overall majority, analysts said.     that should dampen speculation of an early june election, they added.  reuter &#3;</h3>
