	<h3>the canadian import tribunal said the countervailing duty on u.s. corn imports should be cut to 30 canadian cts a bushel from 1.10 dlrs a bushel.     in a report to the canadian finance department, the tribunal said the duty is hurting canadian farmers and food processors. the duty was imposed last year after the revenue department found u.s. corn production was subsidized.     it is now up to the government to decide whether to change the duty.  reuter &#3;</h3>
