	<h3><sulpetro ltd> said it had not yet obtained canadian government approval of a previously reported agreement to restructure its 505 mln dlr debt, and remaines dependent in the interim on support from its principal banker.     sulpetro said it was operating as if the restructuring were implemented, and was required to pay interest only on the term loan part of its debt.    it earlier said its net loss for the first quarter ended january 31 fell to 9.9 mln dlrs from a restated year-earlier loss of 17.3 mln dlrs.     sulpetro president michael williams declined to speculate, in reply to a query, on when government approval of the restructuring deal was likely.     the company said first quarter costs fell to 25.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 45.5 mln dlrs, due partly to lower sales costs and reduced depletion because of its fiscal 1986 writedown.     first quarter revenues fell to 14.7 mln dlrs from year-earlier 29.8 mln because of lower wellhead prices, reduced gas and natural gas liquids sales, disposal of its british properties and surrender of part of the irish-lindbergh heavy oil properties, sulpetro said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
