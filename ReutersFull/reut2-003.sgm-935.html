	<h3>detroit edison co said it has nearly completed the 50 pct power level testing of its fermi 2 nuclear power plant near monroe, mich.     the company said it is preparing to ask the nuclear regulatory commission for the go-ahead to enter the next series of tests at up to the 75 pct power level.     detroit edison also said because of a decision to modify fermi's reheating apparatus, the company has set back the schedule for the plant's commercial operation run to early june from may one.     detroit edison said with interest and other charges running about 1.0 mln dlrs a day, the delay caused by reheater modifications will add approximately 30 mln dlrs to the plant's cost, raising the estimated total cost to 4.26 billion dlrs from 4.23 billion dlrs.  reuter &#3;</h3>
