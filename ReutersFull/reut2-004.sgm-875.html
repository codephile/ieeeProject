	<h3>duff and phelps said it changed the ratings on outstanding senior debt of baker international corp and hughes tool company.     the change affects 515 mln dlrs in debt and assumes a merger of the two companies will be completed.     baker's senior debt was downgraded to dp-8 (high bbb) from dp-7 (low a).     hughes senior debt was raised to dp-8 from dp-12 (middle bb) while subordinated debt was raised to dp-9 (middle bbb) from dp-14 (high b).     the debt ratio of the combined compaies will be about 40 pct but available cash plus proceeds from the sale of assets will permit a prompt reduction in debt, duff and phelps said.     however, fixed charge coverages will remain very thin until the company's markets improve, d and p said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
