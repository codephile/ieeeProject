	<h3>finance ministry proposals for abolishing bourse transaction taxes for non-residents have been blocked in cabinet and will not be re-submitted for several weeks, a finance ministry spokesman said.     government sources said the blockage would also delay an announcement of measures that would simplify the procedure for non-residents to recoup the 25 pct withholding tax levied on investment income in belgium.     finance minister mark eyskens told reuters yesterday that he hoped the cabinet would approve the bourse transaction tax proposals today.     eyskens also said he would in the next few days announce plans to simplify and eventually stop the procedure for foreign investors to reclaim witholding tax.     financial analysts said the current procedure is so slow that it effectively acts as a barrier to foreign investment in belgium, especially in the bond market.     they said the move to simplify it would be far more significant than the abolition for non-residents of the bourse transaction taxes. these are set at three rates -- 0.07 pct, 0.14 pct and 0.35 pct -- according to the security transacted.     government sources said abolition of the bourse taxes for foreign investors had been held up by concern in the cabinet over the budgetary impact of the move, put by the ministry spokesman at 125 mln francs a year.     the sources said it was likely that this proposal and plans to simplify the witholding tax procedure would now be submitted together to the cabinet in several weeks.     eyskens said abolition of the transaction taxes for non-residents would make brussels one of the few stock exchanges in the world where foreign investors were not subjected to such a tax.  reuter &#3;</h3>
