	<h3><hapag lloyd ag> said it ordered a new container vessel from china for its australia service.     the order was given to the <hudong shipyards> in shanghai after lengthy negotiations with west german shipbuilders, the company said in a statement.     the chinese firm offered to build the vessel at over 30 mln marks less than west german yards, despite government subsidies which bonn pays its ailing shipbuilding industry, hapag said. a company spokesman would not comment on the total order value but said the new vessel would replace the 33,333 dwt sydney express in 1989 and would carry 2,700 container units.  reuter &#3;</h3>
