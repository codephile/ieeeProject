	<h3>the senate banking committee has postponed until march 10 its meeting scheduled for tomorrow to act on a bank regulation bill.     a committee aide said the postponement was requested by republican members who wanted more time to look over a revised  draft version of the bill which was just introduced.     that version of the bill would allow non-bank banks to continue activities in operation as of march 5, but would prohibit them from starting other financial services.     the previous draft bill would have banned non-bank bank activities started after july 1, 1983.  reuter &#3;</h3>
