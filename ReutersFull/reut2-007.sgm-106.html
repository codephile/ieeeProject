	<h3>control resource industries inc said the company estimates 1986 earnings to be between 800,000 and 900,000 dlrs, or 22 to 25 cts per share, compared with 852,000 dlrs, or 33 cts per share, during 1985.     the company said preliminary estimates of 1986 revenues is 24.5 mln dlrs, compared with 7,900,000 for 1985.     the estimated 1986 results are based on 3,207,000 shares outstanding, compared to 2,566,000 shares outstanding for 1985.     r. steven lutterbach, chairman, said net income for 1986 was adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins at the company's western environmental subsidiary, and to an increase in bad debt reserves.     western environmental was acquired in march 1986. lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve financial and accounting controls, primarily at western, which were not adequate at the time of acquisition.     he noted the final results for the fourth quarter will depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second and fourth quarters.     lutterbach said it is possible second quarter results will be restated, though final net income for the year will remain in the estimated range.     he added preliminary indications for first quarter 1987 revenues were favorable.  reuter &#3;</h3>
