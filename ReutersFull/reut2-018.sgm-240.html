	<h3>nuclear data inc said its auditors, ernst and whinney, quaified their opinion on its financial statements for the fiscal year ended february 28.     as previously reported, nuclear data's bank debt matures on june 30, 1987, and its lenders have required it to obtain replacement financing by then.     it said the auditors qualified their opinion because the company does not yet have a commitment for replacement financing. nuclear data said it expects to have such financing in place shortly.  reuter &#3;</h3>
