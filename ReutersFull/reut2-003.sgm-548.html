	<h3>canadian prime minister brian mulroney announced a major shakeup in the ranks of his key advisers  after weeks of continuing criticism of his government.      mulroney announced the departure of his senior policy advisor, the resignation of his press secretary and the reassignment of his communications director.      mulroney's progressive conservative government, shaken by a series of cabinet resignations and allegations of corruption, has been trailing the opposition parties for months in public opinion polls.      the prime minister, who led the conservatives to a landslide victory in the 1984 general election, had been urged by party loyalists to make major changes within his office.      a cabinet shuffle is expected later this month in advance of more personnel changes within mulroney's office as the prime minister seeks to regain public confidence.      the next election is expected sometime in 1988, although it could be delayed until mid-1989.  reuter &#3;</h3>
