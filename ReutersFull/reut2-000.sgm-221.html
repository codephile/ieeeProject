	<h3>britain's centrist liberal-social democratic alliance won a surprise victory in a parliamentary by-election in the london borough of greenwich, a seat held by the main opposition labour party for the past 50 years.     rosie barnes, a social democratic member of the alliance, won with 18,287 votes, or 53 pct, and a majority of 6,611 seats over her nearest rival, labour candidate deirdre wood.     the conservatives came third with 3,852 votes.     the result is expected to play a key role in determining when prime minister margaret thatcher, leader of the ruling conservatives, might call a general election.  reuter &#3;</h3>
