	<h3>regulations governing hedging and risk management should be revised and development of new futures instruments cautiously monitored in dealing with the growth of off-exchange futures instruments, robert davis, a commissioner on the commodity futures trading commission, cftc, said.     davis told the chicago chapter of the futures industry association commodity research division last night "there is no cause for undue alarm" in the growth of off-exchange instruments.     however, he said, the cftc "must clarify jurisdictional and regulatory issues" by maintaining the safeguards intended by commodity regulations while encouraging "the further development of competitive markets."     "there is not a single off-exchange issue, there cannot be one policy approach, and to the extent that problems exist, there cannot be one solution," davis said.     the development of off-exchange instruments with futures contract characteristics has become of increasing concern to federal regulators who are trying to define what issues are covered under existing regulations and where new regulations are needed to protect private investment.     davis said the cftc should step up enforcement where off-exchange instruments are intended to compete with exchange-traded issues, correct "regulatory inflexibility" which may force new instruments off exchange, and "delineate and separate those harmful off-exchange developments from the many that are not."     "we cannot ignore that some of the growth of off-exchange trading represents a desirable further development of financial forward contracts that complement, rather than compete with, the relatively new financial futures contracts," davis said.     he said a cftc task force is continuing its investigation of the off-exchange issue.  reuter &#3;</h3>
