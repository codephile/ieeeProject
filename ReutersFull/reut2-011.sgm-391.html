	<h3>unfavorable late winter weather conditions in the main wheat growing areas of yugoslavia indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop, the u.s. embassy's agricultural officer in belgrade said.     the officer, who travelled through an area from belgrade to subotica, said in a field report dated march 27 the wheat crop had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell that followed a period of warm weather.     he said unseasonably warm weather in late february that brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.     damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.     the report said that since much of the early growth in february was from late seeding rather than from normal development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive than some local observers say.     the most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields on normal maize soils. stands in these fields were thin and chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.     however, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which would aid recovery.  reuter &#3;</h3>
