	<h3>president reagan angrily denounced press reports that his wife, nancy, is running the government as "despicable fiction."     he said the reports had "touched a nerve."     reagan made the comments at a photo session with william webster, his nominee as head of the central intelligence agency.     the president and mrs reagan celebrate their 35th wedding anniversary today as reagan prepares to make an address to the nation on the iran-contra scandal tonight.     when a reporter asked about mrs reagan's role in government, reagan replied: "i think this is being bandied by the press. that is fiction and i think it is despicable fiction.  and a lot of people ought to be ashamed of themselves."     pressed for further comment, reagan said, "the idea that she is involved in governmental decisions and so forth... and being a kind of a dragon lady, there is nothing to that."     reagan flatly denied that that his wife had had a role in the departure from the white house last friday of reagan's chief of staff, donald regan, as has been widely reported.     regan's successor, former senator howard baker, was in the room as reagan made his comments.  reuter &#3;</h3>
