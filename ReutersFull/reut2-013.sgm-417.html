	<h3>the dollar started lower after an easier close in the far east on selling amid continuing bearish sentiment and despite bank of japan intervention, dealers said.     but they said european markets were likely to be calm today, with the dollar remaining in a narrow trading range ahead of the washington monetary talks.     the dollar was quoted at an early 6.0565/90 francs after a late 6.0710/30 range here and close in new york at 6.0745/75.     the mark was quoted at an early 332.72/75 francs per 100 against last night's late 332.70/72 range.  reuter &#3;</h3>
