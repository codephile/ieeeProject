	<h3>toshiba corp <tsba.t> expects to report a group net profit of 38 billion yen for the year ending march 31, 1988, up 11.2 pct from a year earlier, assuming an exchange rate of 140 yen to the dollar, a company official said.     osamu iemura, a senior vice president, told a news conference sales are forecast at 3,500 billion yen, up 5.8 pct. the forecasts are based on expectations of improved sales of office automation equipment, a recovery in semiconductor market prices and an increase in plant exports.     toshiba said earlier that 1986/87 group net profit fell 42.5 pct from a year earlier to 34.18 billion yen, the second consecutive year-on-year drop. sales fell 1.9 pct to 3,308 billion yen, the first year-on-year sales drop in 21 years.     iemura said the results reflected trade friction over semiconductor exports to the u.s., the yen's sharp rise against the dollar and a drop in exports to china.     the 1986/87 foreign exchange loss totalled 145 billion yen, including parent company losses of 120 billion.     the average value of the yen against the dollar rose to 161 from 221 a year earlier, he added.     weaker prices for semiconductors and office automation equipment cut total sales 245 billion yen, iemura said.     group sales of telecommunication and electronic devices, accounting for 36 pct of the total, rose five pct to 1,183 billion yen in 1987/88 from a year earlier, helped by good sales of word processors, workstations, medical equipment, point-of-sales systems and exports of personal computers.     semiconductor sales rose to 410 billion yen from 360 billion a year earlier but fell short of an expected 430 billion. sales are expected to be 460 billion in 1987/88.     office automation equipment sales rose to 650 billion yen in 1986/87 from 600 billion a year earlier, iemura said. sales in 1987/88 are expected to be 695 billion yen, mainly due to good sales of computers in europe and to expectations the u.s. will remove its 100 pct import duty on computers.     sales of heavy electric goods, accounting for 26 pct of sales, rose 0.2 pct from a year earlier to 868.14 billion yen.     home electronics sales fell 10 pct to 940.64 billion yen, mainly due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar and a drop in colour television exports to china, iemura said.     overall 1986/87 overseas sales totalled 1,021 billion yen, down three pct from a year earlier, iemura said.     overseas sales of telecommunication and electronic devices rose nine pct from a year earlier to 493.90 billion yen, helped by a 80 pct year-on-year rise in computer and computer-related equipment sales.     home appliance sales abroad fell 24 pct to 312.10 billion, mainly due to the yen's appreciation, lower sales to china, and increased competition with newly-industrialised countries.     toshiba reduced the number of divisions to three from four in reaction to market changes, effective april 1.     group sales of telecommunication and electronic devices are estimated at 1,520 billion yen in 1987/88, iemura said.     home appliance sales are estimated at 1,260 billion yen and heavy electric goods sales at 720 billion.     iemura said group exports to china are expected to rise to 90 billion yen in 1987/88 from 30 billion in 1986/87 due to an increase in sales of generators.     sales to china were down from 70 billion yen in 1985/86 due to a sharp drop in home appliance exports, he said.     group capital spending in 1987/88 will fall to 197 billion yen from 213.30 billion in 1986/87, iemura said.     of total capital spending, investment in semiconductors will fall to 65 billion from 68 billion.     research and development spending will rise to 217 billion yen from 201.10 billion, he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
