	<h3>illinois governor james thompson will likely sign a bill setting december 1, 1990, as the trigger date opening the state to wider interstate banking, a gubernatorial spokesman said.     the bill passed both chambers of the illinois legislature this week by wide margins.     the bill provides that illinois banks and bank holding companies can be acquired by similar institutions from any state with a reciprocal law. current illinois law limits interstate banking to six midwestern states.     the governor had supported a july 1, 1988, date for full interstate banking. large banking firms, particularly citicorp <cci>, have lobbied for the earlier date.     but legislation with the later date was approved in the state's house and senate. the governor has the authority to use an amendatory veto and pencil in an earlier trigger date.     "i'm sure the bill will get his approval," the spokesman said. "the only question is whether he will use his authority to change the trigger date. he will hear from people who want the different dates. i don't think he'll take action before late summer."  reuter &#3;</h3>
