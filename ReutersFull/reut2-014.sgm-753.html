	<h3>the reagan administration is secretly developing plans for an early deployment of president reagan's controversial "star wars" anti-missile system, according to a senate study.     "near-term deployment is an absurd and dangerous course for america," said sen. bennett johnston in a statement issued with the report. "it would force us to break the bank, throw out the abm treaty and commit us to an arms race in space."     the reagan administration is engaged in an internal debate over the strategic defense initiative (sdi), as the land and space-based anti-missile system is called, and may decide later this month to reinterpret the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty to justify an acceleration of sdi research to include development and space testing.     johnston, of louisiana, and fellow democrat william proxmire of wisconsin, whose staff prepared the report, accused the administration of covertly seeking early  deployment as a political ploy to commit the united states to strategic defenses even after reagan leaves office in 1989.     "this report exposes the fact that without a presidential directive or congressional consent, the sdi program ... is being changed to pursue a near-term deployment of strategic defenses," proxmire, chairman of the powerful senate appropriations defense subcommittee, said.     "in other words, they're covertly reorienting the sdi program without congressional approval."     reuter &#3;</h3>
