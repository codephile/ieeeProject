	<h3>office of management and budget director james miller said president reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the house budget committee's 1988 budget proposal which is before the house for a vote today.     "it's just completely unacceptable," miller told a house appropriations subcommittee on treasury, postal service and general government appropriations.     the plan, drafted by the democratic-controlled budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees.     the house committee's budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes.     miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the u.s. economy.     "if we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that we've had in the last five years at risk," miller told the subcommittee.     "the result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end," miller said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
