	<h3>network control corp said it intends to take a 250,000 dlr charge against earnings for the third quarter ended march 31 and said sales for the quarter would be about 400,000 dlrs, about 50 pct below sales in the same year-ago quarter.     network said it is taking the charge due to the significant increase in accounts receivable which remain uncollected for more than 90 days after billing. it said it ultimately will collect most of those accounts.     it attributed the sales decline to a transition period for its new products and a delay in a major order.  reuter &#3;</h3>
