	<h3>a one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury loan stock due 1997 was exhausted in very early trading on the u.k. government bond market only minutes after becoming available for trading, dealers said.     the bank of england said the issue, announced on monday and available for official dealings from this morning, was no longer operating as a tap. the striking price was a partly paid 41 stg pct, at which price bids were allotted 53.8 pct.     dealers noted that strong demand had been detected for the bonds yesterday afternoon and interest was further stimulated by sterling's surge at the opening this morning.     the issue was announced on monday, when it was widely seen as a move by the authorities to brake market optimism for a further u.k. interest rate reduction following the half-point cut in clearing bank base lending rates to 10.5 pct earlier in the day.     dealers said that the bank's strategy succeeded in stemming pressure for a further rate reduction only briefly, as the market yesterday recovered all the ground it lost on monday immediately after the announcement.     demand for the issue was lively from u.k. and overseas sources, with particular interest seen from japan.     the bonds were issued at a price of 96-16/32 stg pct, partly paid as to 40 stg pct on application, although the government broker this morning sold them at a premium of one stg pct over the partly paid issue price.     the issue has been designated the "b" tranche of the bonds, since 1.3 billion stg of 8-3/4 pct treasury loan stock due 1997 is already in issue.     dealers noted that the bank of england last week issued one billion stg of nine pct exchequer bonds due 2002 in an effort to dampen enthusiasm for an interest rate reduction caused by sterling's uptrend on foreign exchange markets.     last week's issue was sold out on its first day of dealings but with nothing resembling the determined demand seen this morning for the new tranche of bonds, dealers said.     after stifling pressure for a rate cut last week, the authorities finally sanctioned a base rate reduction on monday, following it up with the announcement of the one billion stg bond issue.     sterling was briefly depressed by the rate cut but this morning opened very strongly again, starting on a trade-weighted basis at 72.6 against yesterday's final 72.1 and later edging up to 72.7.     u.k. money market rates declined again this morning by up to 1/8 point, strongly reinforcing yesterday's speculation that clearing bank base lending rates could drop into single figures after the budget next tuesday, money market dealers said.     u.k. government bond dealers noted that under the influence of stronger sterling and the further fall in money market rates, prices this morning had opened as much as 3/4 point higher at the longer end of the market.  reuter &#3;</h3>
