	<h3>the bank of france will not hold a money market intervention tender today, ruling out a further cut in its 7-3/4 pct intervention rate, central bank sources said.     at the tenders, depending on market conditions, the bank injects liquidity into the market by buying up first category paper. but market sources said that while the recent franc performance leaves room for a further quarter point cut in the intervention rate there was plenty of market liquidity.     the bank cut its rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct on march 9, the first change since january 2. interest rates also fell the same week in britain, belgium and italy.  reuter &#3;</h3>
