	<h3>switzerland will use most of its budget surplus projected for 1988 to redeem its debt, the finance ministry said.     the government's plan calls for income to exceed expenditure by 1.3 billion swiss francs next year. after internal transfers, net income was seen reaching 637 mln francs.     the ministry said in a press release the surplus would be used "for the most part for redeeming debt" but also help finance environmental protection, public transport and research and development projects.     "thanks to the favourable liquidity situation, debt will be able to be repaid," the ministry said. "that will reduce the net interest burden to 2.2 pct of net income, the lowest point since 1974."     finance minister otto strich said the government plans to continue its tight fiscal policy as it moves toward its goal of reducing taxes. in the meantime, it will concentrate on redeeming its debt, he said in a statement.     "in that way the interest payment burden on state finances can be reduced and the government's ability to set policy broadened," he said.  reuter &#3;</h3>
