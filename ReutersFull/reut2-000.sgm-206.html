	<h3>an unmanned delta rocket carrying a 57 mln dlr hurricane-tracking satellite blasted off here today in nasa's first successful launch of the year.     the 116-foot (35.4-meter) delta -- a reliable workhorse of the u.s. rocket fleet -- lifted off at 1805 est from cape canaveral air force station in a crucial test of the space agency's ability to recover from the challenger disaster and a string of other failures.     the launch came after two delays in two days. the first postponement was caused by fuel leak and the second by high-speed crosswinds that nasa officials say could have torn the rocket apart during fiery ascent.  reuter &#3;</h3>
