	<h3>acme precision products inc said a management group has withdrawn a six dlr per share leveraged buyout offer.     acme said the management group dropped its bid due to continued weakness in the machine tool industry and in acme precision's operating results and to the inability of the management group to obtain modifications to terms of its financing commitment.     it said, "the effect of these factors led the management group to conclude that the six dlr per share price was excessive under current conditions."  reuter &#3;</h3>
