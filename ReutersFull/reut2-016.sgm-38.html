	<h3>the european community (ec) will retaliate against u.s. textile exports if congress passes trade legislation damaging european interests, an ec official warned today.     roy denman, head of the ec delegation here, issued the warning in a letter to senator lloyd bentsen, chairman of the finance committee. a copy was provided to reuters.     the bill, backed by the textile industry and senators from textile-producing states, would impose global quotas on textile imports and for the first time include europe.     denman said he was concerned about provisions in the bill that would limit, if not eliminate, the president's discretion in retaliating against nations that keep their home markets closed to foreign goods.  reuter &#3;</h3>
