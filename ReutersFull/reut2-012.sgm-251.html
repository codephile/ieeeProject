	<h3>the democratic-controlled house budget committee neared approval, over republican objections, of a trillion dlr budget plan for 1988.     committee chairman william gray said he wanted approval later today of the democratic-written document, which would produce a deficit of about 133 billion dlrs using congressional budget office estimates.     however, gray said using president reagan's economic assumptions, the plan would show a deficit of 108 billion dlrs to meet the gramm-rudman budget law target. republicans protested they had not seen the plan until today.  reuter &#3;</h3>
