	<h3>west germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in february from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in january, a spokeswoman for the federal statistics office said.     the trade surplus in february widened to a provisional 10.4 billion marks from 7.2 billion in january, she added.     the statistics office had originally put the january current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.     the february trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. but the current account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus recorded in february 1986.     a statistics office statement said the widening of the february current account surplus compared with january was due to seasonal factors. neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted.     february imports, measured in terms of value, totalled 32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against february 1986 but a rise of 5.5 pct against january.     exports in february, also in value terms, totalled 42.56 billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in february 1986 but up 13 pct compared with january.     the statistics office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in february. but for comparison purposes it noted that in january the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.     within the current account, the services account had 300 mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark deficit.     taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a year earlier. the value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks, a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.     the resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for january/february compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1 billion marks in the year-ago period.     the cumulative current account surplus for january and february 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion marks a year earlier, the statistics office said.     bank economists said the rise in the february trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors. the federal statistics office said earlier this week that february import prices fell 0.7 pct against january while export prices were unchanged.     "the rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least," said an economist. he said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.     an economist at the bank fuer gemeinwirtschaft (bfg) in frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a more accurate picture of west germany's trade position.     he noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for january and february together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus posted in november and december.     "the trend is clearly lower," he said.     this economist, who declined to be named, said the february rise was also partly explained by special factors in january, when there had been a number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.  reuter &#3;</h3>
