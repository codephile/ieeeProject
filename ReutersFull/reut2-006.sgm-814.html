	<h3>gamco investors inc, an affiliate of gabelli and co, plans to propose an anti-greenmail provision at the gencorp inc annual meeting march 31, according to gamco chairman mario gabelli.     greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a premium by a company from an unwanted investor. gencorp today received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8 pct of its stock.     gabelli also said gamco has sent a 13-d filing to the securities and exchange commission on the 6.5 pct of gencorp stock held by gamco and its affiliates.     the stock amounts to 1,462,000 shares and most of it was reported in an earlier 13-g filing. a 13-g is filed by passive investors to show holdings of more than five pct.     earlier today, general partners, owned by wagner and brown and afg industries inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tender offer for gencorp. analysts said the offer was between 10 and 20 dlrs per share too low.     gencorp has made no comment on the offer.     gabelli said he also proposes that management consider spinning off all assets, other than the gencorp broadcast properties, to shareholders. the licenses of the broadcast properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges.     "one thing is going to be clear and that is i'm going to the meeting and putting up "no greenmail," gabelli said.     gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation in the offer.     the annual meeting is to be held in akron, ohio.   reuter &#3;</h3>
