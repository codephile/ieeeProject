	<h3>international lease finance corp is negotiating with <airbus industrie> for additional orders of a320 and a330 jets, according to ilfc president steven udvar-hazy.     ilfc, a commercial aircraft leasing concern, last week set conditional orders with airbus, the european consortium, for three short-haul a320s and three a330s.     "we're negotiating with airbus for additional units beyond those six planes," udvar-hazy told reuters in an interview. "we're talking mainly about more a320s, but also about more a330s," he said. he declined to elaborate.     reports in the french press today indicated that ilfc was close to signing an agreement to buy 27 of the a320 jets.     the total value of the order announced last week is 350 mln dlrs. the jets are scheduled for delivery beginning in 1991. however, the order for the a330s is conditional on a decision by the airbus board to launch the plane.     airbus has said it will decide by the end of this month whether to launch the medium range a330 and the companion, long range a340. it says it has 104 orders and options from nine airlines for the two planes.     ilfc is one of the launch customers for the a330, udvar-hazy noted.     earlier today, swissair dealt a blow to airbus by opting to order six md-11 long range aircraft from mcdonnell douglas corp <md>, airbus's rival in the competition to provide a long range passenger plane alternative to boeing co's <ba> new versions of the 747.  reuter &#3;</h3>
