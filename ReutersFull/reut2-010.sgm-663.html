	<h3>the ussr will hold local council elections on june 21 at which voters in some districts will have a choice of candidates as part of an experiment in electoral reform, the tass news agency said.     the official agency said yesterday the selected districts, still to be chosen, would have a slate of several candidates, not all of whom could be elected, and voters would strike out the names of those they did not support.     tass said candidates would have to win support from more than 50 pct of registered constituents to win seats.     voting is compulsory in the soviet union.     in the past, official returns for elections at most levels in the soviet government system have recorded 99 to 100 pct support for all candidates. voters simply dropped the official ballot paper with the single candidate's name into an urn.     tass said districts chosen for the experiment would return several deputies rather than a single representative to local council bodies.     the announcement followed pledges on electoral reform by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev, campaigning to revitalise confidence in the communist system after what he has described as a period of stagnation.  reuter &#3;</h3>
