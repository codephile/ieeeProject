	<h3>the house today supported a call for japan to boost its defense spending to help share the burden of protecting western interests in sensitive areas around the world, including in the gulf.     house member approved a measure that would require secretary of state george shultz to enter into talks with japan on increasing japanese defense spending to at least 3 pct of its gross national product.     the measure, passed during consideration of the 1988-89 state department funding bill would not require an increase, but legislators called on japan to spend more on defense. the senate must approve the measure before it becomes law.     "we don't have to bash the japanese. we have to show them how to share the burden of the defense of the free world," said rep. robert dornan, a california republican.     the amendment calls on shultz to enter into talks with japan with the aim of reaching agreement on one of two alternatives: either japan can spend 3 pct of its gnp on defense by itself or give the equivalent amount of money to the united states as a kind of security fee.  reuter &#3;</h3>
