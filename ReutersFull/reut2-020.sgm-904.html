	<h3>media general inc's chairman, d. tennant bryant, said his family would not sell its controlling share block, so it would be impossible for an investor group led by <giant group ltd> to gain control of the company.     the investor group, which includes barris industries <brrs.o>, recently reported that it acquired a 9.8 pct stake of media general's class a shares and might seek control.     bryant said the company's class a stock elects only 30 pct of the board, with the remaining 70 pct being elected by class b shares, two-thirds of which are controlled by the bryant family trust, which has no intention of selling its shares.  reuter &#3;</h3>
