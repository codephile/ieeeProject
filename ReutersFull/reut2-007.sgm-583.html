	<h3>the retail price index (rpi), britain's measure of inflation, rose 0.4 pct in february on a revised basis, to give a year-on-year rise of 3.9 pct, the employment department said.     in january, the index rose 0.4 pct for a 3.9 pct year-on-year rise on both the previous base and the new index.     the february rpi was set at 100.4, base january 1987. in february 1986, the rpi rose 0.4 pct, giving a 5.1 pct year-on-year increase on the old basis.     the inflation data compares with market forecasts for a rise of 0.4 - 0.5 pct in february and a yearly rise of about four pct, economists said.     the employment department said the rise in the index between january and february was mainly the result of higher prices for petrol, fresh vegetables, cars and car maintenance.  reuter &#3;</h3>
