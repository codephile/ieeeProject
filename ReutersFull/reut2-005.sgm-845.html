	<h3>britain's public sector borrowing requirement (psbr) showed a provisional net repayment of 300 mln stg in february, compared with an unrevised 3.7 billion stg repayment in january, the treasury said.     this gives a cumulative psbr in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year of 100 mln stg, compared with a 2.7 billion requirement in the like period last year.     the government's forecast for the psbr in fiscal 1986/87 is 7.1 billion stg, but markets expect a significant undershoot on this number. the february data was within market forecasts.     the central government borrowing requirement on its own account in february was a net repayment of 100 mln stg after a unrevised net repayment of 3.4 billion stg in january. in the first 11 months, the central government borrowing on its own account was 2.3 billion stg, after 2.1 billion in january.     local authorities made a repayment estimated at 100 mln stg in february. the cumulative local authorities' repayment for the first 11 months was 700 mln. the treasury said the fall about 2.5 billion stg in the cumulative psbr at this point this year over last was largely due to lower public corporation and local authority borrowing. this was also the case last month, it said.     the public corporations' borrowing requirement is estimated at minus 400 mln stg, to give a cumulative repayment of 1.4 billion stg.     the local authority and public sector surplus on the 11 months cumulative basis was 2.1 billion, compared with a flat position at the same stage last year.     the treasury said that the proceeds from privatisation of <british airways plc> reduced requirements by 400 mln stg.     the treasury said the general government borrowing requirement is estimated to be a net repayment of 100 mln stg in february, giving a cumulative requirement of 1.1 billion.     consolidated fund revenue was 8.8 billion stg in february, giving a cumulative total of 101.4 billion in the first 11 months, 4.5 pct up from the like stage last year.     inland revenue receipts for the first 11 months were 1.8 billion stg, or 3.5 pct higher than a year earlier. receipts from customs and excise were 3.5 billion stg in the first 11 months, 10.5 pct higher than in the previous year.     the treasury said that budget forestalling, when traders bring in goods in advance of today's annual budget, brought in 300 mln stg more in customs and excise receipts than in february 1986.     consolidated fund expenditure was 8.4 billion stg in february, with a cumulative 102.5 billion for the first 11 months, four pct higher than in the previous year.     supply expenditure was provisionally estimated at 8.3 billion stg in february, giving a cumulative total of 91.2 billion or three pct above last year's equivalent total.  reuter &#3;</h3>
