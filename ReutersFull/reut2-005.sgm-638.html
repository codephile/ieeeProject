	<h3>missouri republican senators john danforth and christopher bond have introduced a bill that would allow wheat and feedgrain producers along the mississippi and missouri rivers hurt by flooding last year to collect at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments this year without planting.     danforth aide austin schlick said the bill was similar to a provision included in a house agriculture committee-passed emergency disaster assistance bill scheduled to be taken up by the house tomorrow.     schlick said flooding destroyed a number of levees along the two rivers last october, leaving farmland there vulnerable to further damage this year.  reuter &#3;</h3>
