	<h3>the bank of england said it had invited the discount houses to make an early round of bill offers to help offset a large liquidity shortage in the money market.     it estimated the shortage at around 1.55 billion stg, one adverse factor being the unwinding of a sale and repurchase agreement, with the market having to buy back bills worth 542 mln stg from the bank.     bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 957 mln stg wile exchequer transactions and a note circulation rise would take out 15 mln and 25 mln respectively. above target bankers' balances would add 10 mln.  reuter &#3;</h3>
