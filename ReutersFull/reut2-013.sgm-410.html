	<h3>the cash bond market closed higher in active trade led by securities houses' speculative buying and end-investor purchases of low coupon issues, triggered by declines in short-term interest rates, dealers said.     the yield on the 5.1 pct 89th bond of 1996 closed at the low for the day of 3.905 pct against the 3.955 close yesterday, and the 3.930 opening. the 5.3 pct 95th bond of 1997 finished at 4.010 pct against 4.165 at yesterday's close and an opening today of 4.100. active dealing accounts of city and trust banks heavily bought low coupon issues on the rate decline and in expectation of a further fall, dealers said.     the lingering bearish outlook for the dollar is sustaining hopes of another drop in japanese rates, regardless of what emerges from the expected meeting tomorrow of the g-7 meeting.     the key u.s. 7-1/2 pct treasury bond due 2016 was 95.26-28 in late tokyo trade against the 96.04-06 new york finish.     in the absence of retail participation, the key bond eased on dealer position adjustments on the dollar's renewed weakness ahead of the expected meeting.     however, some bankers said japanese investors would return to the market, due to a wider japan/u.s. yield gap and demand for liquidity, but only if the dollar stabilizes.  reuter &#3;</h3>
