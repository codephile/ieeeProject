	<h3>biogen inc said the european patent office granted it a patent covering certain proteins used to produce a hepatitis b vaccine through genetic engineering techniques.     robert gottlieb, biogen spokesman, said the company has licensed the vaccine on a nonexclusive basis to <wellcome plc>, the british pharmaceutical firm, and is discussing licensing with other companies.     biogen said the patent gives it the right to exclude others from marketing hepatitis b vaccine in the 11 member countries of the european patent convention.     gottlieb said the company has also filed a patent in other markets, including the u.s. the vaccine is in clinical tests.     patents in the biotechnology field are particularly important as the company with an exclusive patent can reap large rewards. recently many of the products of genetic engineering have become the target of patent lawsuits.     merck and co inc <mrk> already sells a genetically engineered hepatitis b vaccine in the u.s. called recombivax hb. a subsidiary of <smithkline beckman corp>, smithkline biologicals, based in belgium, is selling a hepatitis b vaccine, called engerix-b, in belgium.     a smithkline spokesman said the vaccine has also been formally approved in switzerland and luxembourg and has been authorized for market in a number of far east countries.     hepatitis b is a serious liver infection common in many parts of africa and southeast asia where about five pct to 15 pct of the population carry the virus. in the u.s. about 200,000 new cases occur each year.     last december the european patent ofice rejected biogen's patent for alpha-interferon, which biogen said it will appeal once it receives a formal written opinion from the office.      reuter &#3;</h3>
