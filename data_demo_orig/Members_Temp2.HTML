TAMIL
<HR>
Tamil  is a Dravidian language spoken predominantly by Tamil people of the Indian subcontinent. It has official status in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and in the Indian union territory of Puducherry. Tamil is also an official language of Sri Lanka and Singapore. It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and the first Indian language to be declared as a classical language by the government of India in 2004. Tamil is also spoken by significant minorities in Malaysia and Mauritius as well as emigrant communities around the world.[1]
<HR>
Tamil is one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world.[7][8] Tamil literature has existed for over two thousand years.[9] The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and hero stones date from around the 3rd century BCE.[10] The earliest period of Tamil literature, Sangam literature, is dated from the 300 BCE – 300 CE.[11][12] Tamil language inscriptions written c. 1st century BCE and 2nd century CE have been discovered in Egypt, Sri Lanka and Thailand.[13] The two earliest manuscripts from India,[14][15] to be acknowledged and registered by UNESCO Memory of the World register in 1997 and 2005 were in Tamil.[16] More than 55% of the epigraphical inscriptions (about 55,000) found by the Archaeological Survey of India are in the Tamil language.[17] According to a 2001 survey, there were 1,863 newspapers published in Tamil, of which 353 were dailies.[18] It has the oldest extant literature amongst other Dravidian languages.[7] The variety and quality of classical Tamil literature has led to its being described as "one of the great classical traditions and literatures of the world".[19]
