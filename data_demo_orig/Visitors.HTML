Beach Resort
<br>
The ancient fishermen hamlet of Pudukkupam established during the Chola period (IX-XII century) is located 10 kms south of Pondicherry city, in the Coromandel coast of the Bay of Bengal. Being near to the estuary of the Chunambar river and the Indian ocean it has a privileged ecological position, not far from the roman ruins of Arikkamedu, a port established in the first century of our era. It is between this hamlet and Pooranankuppam, the rice bowl of this region, that Kailash Beach Resort came up as the first establishment of this class in Pondicherry state.
