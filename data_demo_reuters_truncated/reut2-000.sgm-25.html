	<h3>venezuela and its bank advisory committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last february, bankers said.     they declined to disclose details because two or three representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval of their senior management for the new terms.     the committee was meeting in new york this afternoon and could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today, the bankers said.     "a number of details have still to be finalized, but the broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest rates are in place," one senior banker said.     the interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over eurodollar rates, but venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.     it also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in venezuela.     the breakthrough in the venezuelan talks, which have been going on intermittently for several months, follows the announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt rescheduling pact between chile and its bank advisory panel.     and last night citibank said mexico's financing package, including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on march 20.     while the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental, bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes after the shock of brazil's unilateral interest suspension last friday. by striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the incentive for other debtors to emulate brazil.  reuter &#3;</h3>
